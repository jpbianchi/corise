Ideas

1. MNIST dataset, MetaFlow on finetuning a linear head on SimCLR features. Use weights and biases. Use ONNX for exporting. Use FastAPI to build an endpoint. First, train a linear regression network. Use this to create regression tests.  

2. Integration test via handwritten digits by hand. Pick hardest examples as stretch test. Directionarlity should be rotation (add data augmentation to solve this problem). Do parts of this first for "test-driven development" 

3. Compression- quanitizing via entropy bottleneck? (notebook)
