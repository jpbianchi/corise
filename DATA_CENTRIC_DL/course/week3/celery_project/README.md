# Week 3 Project: Object Detection in a FastAPI

This portion of week 3's project will guide you through building a FastAPI backend to service a pretrained object detector.

## Setup and Installation

We included a `setup.sh` script that will install a virtualenv and then install necessary dependencies. This can be done on Gitpod or your personal computer. You will not need a GPU.

Every time you use a fresh terminal, you should run `source init_env.sh` to resolve any import issues.
