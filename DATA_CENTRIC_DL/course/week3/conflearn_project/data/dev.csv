"been using Nioxin products for years, this one works well for me, does not seem to make more hair grow but retains what I have left.",1
"I bought this lotion when I was about 6 months pregnant because I had tried the Tummy Rub Butter and really liked it. After using it for about a week, I developed an extremely itchy. scaly, and red rash on my chest, breasts, and upper tummy. I stopped using the lotion and the rash cleared up. I tried using it one other time later on in my pregnancy, and then again 6 weeks postpartum, but the rash came back each time. My skin is usually not sensitive and I can use most anything without any issues. I wanted to love this as I wanted something to help avoid sagging but sadly can't use it.",0
I use it once a week mixed with the conditioner and it really work. I had my hair healthier and lighter.,1
"This palette was pretty disappointing. If you're not pasty white, get a different palette. I do not tan very much (would be considered to be medium range as far as skin color goes), but the only contour shade that shows up on my skin is the deep contour shade. I do not understand all the reviews raving about this palette's high pigmentation as it takes alot of product to get even the dark contour to show up on my face. Not only that, I am left with uneven streaks on my face when i attempt to blend.",0
"Bought this for a gift at the suggestion of a friend who wore it. It is a great smelling, decently long lasting scent.
worth every penny!",1
"I purchased this Item and I will review because of 2 things one its not cheap second im not satisfied.
i've been using for 4 months as indicated it does not do anything plus every time i use it irritates my skin and i break out, hair comes back again save your money and look for something else",0
"Will definitely be repurchasing this product again, threw out all my others and will only be using this on my nails.",1
My wife is disappointed with lack of fragrance.,0
hi! it is very difficult to apply the product. please redesign for the customers. I hope this helps. thank you.,0
"My hair is very soft, but has great volume and curls.",1
good!,1
I would not re-purchase this product as it is drugstore quality yet department store price.,0
"I am in love with this product. Don't know why I've never heard of it before. It really does work in seconds. I wouldn't go dig in the garden right after using it, but it prevents little dents and dings until the polish underneath is really dry. It also gives the nails a nice, glossy finish!",1
Doesn't have a pleasant smell.,0
I have used this product for 10 years. It does work towards dimming or fading noticeable pigmentation blemishes.,1
This stopped working after six months.  No return possible.  What a rip off!!!,0
The one I bought from JC PENNY was better I feel this version is copied,0
Good fash wash. I like the grainy texture.,1
"The bottle was not nearly full.  The product is like fine dust, so you would only be able to use it two or three times and the whole bottle would be gone.  I was so shocked and disappointed that I haven't even used it.  I keep meaning to return it, but I've NEVER returned any purchase to Amazon.  This is a first!",0
This is a great color! The brand is high quality but does chip after about a week if you aren't super careful.,1
"I just received this product  it worked for 30mint now the heat is only 92
  it is broken or what",0
"Anybody said: ""Every head is a different world"", and it is true, I have been using this shampoo for a month or so and I now feel my hair really different, the thickening effect is very notorious, it lathers with a few amount and the mint smelling is absolutely agreeable, at least for me of course.

About the DHT blocking and growing properties I think it is too soon for now but I do not have any doubt that this can happen in a few months since its ingredients are recognized as effective to make that kind of job, anyway I am very happy with the first results,

My best regards, Mr. Martorella.",1
There are so many other products better than this. It gets everywhere and it's just a mess. Used it a couple times and gave up bought different brand.,0
Love this product! It makes washing your face fun! :),1
This does the trick when it comes to waterproof mascara.  It is soft in removal and easy to use.,1
I love this product but when I ordered it it arrived open with the oil completely spilled out.,0
I'm ver disappointed in this product. It does perform well for me.  I have fine hair and the body Oribe gives to my hair is minimal.  It does shine my hair very nicely.  For amount of money this costs I expect more than shine.  I need volume and this product did not deliver for me.,0
So far I like it. We've had some really cold weather here and spraying this on my face after applying foundation and blush keeps me hydrated all day.,1
Terrific cream - does everything it should to skin.,1
Yes it is great I love it and recommend it,0
"There's no denying that this smells amazing and feels silky however I don't find it works as well as the Batiste dry shampoo. The moroccanoil still leaves my hair looking somewhat greasy. Not sure its worth the price, when the Batiste is only around $7 a bottle.",1
Worked perfectly until it released it self and landed on our rubber bath mat. No damage but it now fogs up,0
"This goes on very nicely, good color saturation (both the crackle glaze is pigmented, as well as containing turquoise glitter).
Its not a true blue, but not exactly turquoise either, but more turquoisey than teal or blue.
Thickness of application dictates how thick and how many cracks will appear.  Thin coats crack a lot, but very fine cracks and may not saturate well over the base color, so one medium to medium-heavy coat and at least 5 minutes of drying time gives good results.",1
"This shaving kit is okay, but I still get quite a bit of irritation when I use it.  I'll probably go back to<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clinique-Skin-Supplies-for-Men-Essentials-of-Shaving-Travel-Set-Cream-Shave-Post-Shave-Healer-Face-Scrub/dp/B007LS7S18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clinique Skin Supplies for Men Essentials of Shaving Travel Set : Cream Shave +Post Shave Healer +Face Scrub</a>, which was far more gentle on my face.",0
"If I could give NO stars i would!
DO NOT BUY...
I threw in dust bin as soon as I tried it once!
Horrid and ugly colour.
Streaks and hard to put  on...
Like a gel.
Going back to the tried and true Jergens !",0
Love using this,1
"During my first blow drying use, the plastic coating on the brush melted and burnt my hair!  This product is a safety hazard and needs to be recalled.",0
The moisturizer is not greasy but it leaves a white film on my face that does not go away. It is visible enough that my face and neck are two different colors. Unlike a normal sunscreen when first applied it leaves a temporary white residue. Temporary is the key word.,0
"I like the color however the cap is heavy, applying the polish is a task.  It doesn't last too long either.  I wouldn't recommend this for the price.",0
This comes from China and is not the same texture as whatsoever as what you would get it at Beauty brands,0
"I love the product, however,  I had to give 2 stars due to defective spray nozzle. Every time I spritz the product on my hair, the nozzle leaks, wasting my product!  The product itself is actually awesome for my natural curly hair and I love the texture it gives my hair.",0
It does it's job and yes I realize it says small travel size but I didn't realize it meant minute.,1
"I have a very fair skin but this ""natural light"" color is super light even for me. After applying I have to wipe off almost all of it and whatever's left actually do the pretty good job. The main con is the smell - it's so bad, I can't even compare it to anything familiar except of maybe some nasty antibiotic medicine. And it's on your face all day long! Yakkk!!!",0
too sticky easy sweat not smell good. I and my husband used the DKNA the smell very good and last longer then this one,0
"I love Mustela products and have used them for a long time, but I purchased this set as a gift, and it arrived leaking and damaged. I'll be returning it.",0
I really like this foundation. It's long lasting and full coverage.,1
Not worth the money.  Didn't do anything for me.,0
I have just received the product in the box severely damaged. It looks like... someone already opened it and returned. Disappointing.,0
Gives a choppy look - won't recommend it,0
This moisturizer is wonderful ~ very creamy and not greasy ~ I really like the feel it leaves on my face,1
the barrel is smaller than advertised,0
"I've used this product in the past, but this was my first time buying it on Amazon and the first time buying the 33.8 ounce size. It did not have the velvety richness I was used to. I have very curly hair and it knots a lot when I wear it in a loose bun. I am used to The Detangler getting those stubborn knots out, but this particular one did not do the trick. I used it about 10 times before giving up. I eventually tossed it in the trash. I'm going to assume it was old product because I had never had that problem before.",0
"I am very disappointed  to say this is a knock off. :(
Scratches all over and its cheap and light. :(
Also I get it is supposed to get hot but I cant even touch almost any part of whole flat iron when its on 375. The real one I used does not get hot on the outside of iron. Its a very dangerous knock off product. All I can say is I am very fortunate not to have used this on my hair.",0
"I saw this polish on my mom the first time, and it caused me to grab her hand and ask what it was. It looked like the perfect, healthy nude. I usually put it on with 3-4 coats, and it makes my nails look beautifully healthy and shiny, in a better-than-natural way. The only issue I have is with the stupid name (Put It In Neutral), but OPI always gives their polishes stupid names.",1
"Eh, not impressed. Low pigmentation, have barely bothered to use since I've purchased. Not sure if this is legit or not, but if it is a legit product, wouldn't bother trying again.",0
"Great stuff. Along these lines, I recently discovered&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LOccitane-Immortelle-Precious-Gentle-Cleansing/dp/B00B80GS4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B00WB864Q8 Ageless Organic Cleansing Foam</a>, and found it is not only all-natural, but it actually improves my skin.  The apricot kernel oil smells great, and has kept my skin feeling soft, smooth, and breakout free. I love it as a daily cleanser because of how hydrating and nourishing it is. Highly recommend!",1
"I've been looking for a new dryer with a soft bonnet after my last Vidal Sasson dryer broke.  This dryer gets very hot on the middle setting but doesn't dry very well. The low setting while cooler doesn't dry your hair. I  thought the exessive heat would make your hair  dry in half the time but it doesn't. This dryer also makes loud straining noises, which I am hoping doesn't mean the motor is about to quit.

My old dryer is no longer being manufactured and this was the only alternative I could find. What can you do.",0
Was sent a smaller bottle than what i was sold online. very disappointed but i needed it for immediate use or i would have returned it.,0
"Glorified Vaseline. Obvious from ingredients, but they are not hiding it. Active ingredient, ""Petrolatum 56.8%"".  Vaseline is 100% petroleum jelly (also known as petrolatum).  I guess I thought there would be more to it. So a bit pricey but accurate product.",1
Recommended!,1
"I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT SEVERAL MONTHS, now this time it is the worst shampoo and conditioner ever? Is this a knock off? I am very serious enough to write my review here. This was recommended by me to others for months making my hair so full and luscious, and now its damp and drag. What happened? My kids shampoo is a better option. SUPER DISSATISIFIED!!!!",0
Utterly useless. Did nothing. Don't waste your money. There are excellent sprays out there that do a fantastic job. Look elsewhere.,0
"The hairspray works just fine however; the bulb worked only a few times before it stopped working.  I tried to see if the bulb was plugged however; it doesn't look like it was.  I tried to see if there was a way to clean out the bulb, but I didn't get a response.  I gave this two stars just for the hairspray.",0
"Quick, easy and it left my hair soft not fried.  You can also grab large chunks of hair with this size iron..",1
It's smell good,1
I am pleased with this curling iron EXCEPT for the cord - why can't these appliance manufactuers use a non-tangling cord???  It is extremely annoying to constantly be untangling it.,1
"My hair is prone to major frizz in humid Michigan summers. I've tried a bunch of products to help tame frizz, and this is by far the best one yet. I bought it from the salon after my stylist recommended it. It works well and doesn't make my hair feel greasy.",1
Not happy. Too messy,0
Love all the Stila products!,1
wanted it a bit darketr and you have to apply it a lot before it shows up and flows bout once it is there is stays put really really well,1
"I was so excited about getting this, however when it arrived I was very disappointed!! The clear box the straightener came had obviously been opened and was wrapped in plastic to make it look unopened. Then the actual straightener was damaged.... The screw on the handle was bent and sticking out.
 I called amazon and they were very helpful in getting this returned, but since it was sold by an individual seller she could only refund my account which I would then have to repurchase.... So long story short don't buy from this seller! Only amazon direct.
Hopefully I'll have better luck with the next one",0
"The product was all dried up when received, it is useable but not creamy as it should be.",0
Have medium length wavy hair.  Use this product daily before styling and it works great and no frizz.  Would recommend it.,1
Dry.. Dry.. Had to add water to use... Mascara was mud.. Not happy..,0
My wif like it,1
great product,1
"Would have given it 5 stars, but took of one for the high price.",1
Beautiful color and dries so quickly!!,1
I bought this with the intention of using it as a make-up remover. It leaves my face feeling sticky. Definitely leaves a residue on my skin. This is not worth the purchase.,0
"This product smells like seaweed.  I hate putting it on for that reason, so I keep avoiding it.  It will probably sit on my shelf forever.  I never really notice a huge difference in shine either - so not worth walking around with smelly hair.  I won't buy again.",0
"I have used several different shaving creams and Proraso always wins. I use a Merkur safety razor and badger hair brush (forget the brand) for traditional shaving and the lather Proraso offers is wonderful.

I have sensitive skin and Proraso offers the closest shave with virtually no irritation even with up to three passes. The smooth, slide Proraso delivers for the shave is great. As long as your blade is sharp the shave will be smooth with no hair pulling. I have a very course beard and Proraso softens and shaves it amazingly well.",1
Have to use for 5 minutes in the shower with no water running which is difficult for me.  I don't really care for this product.,0
"I am 60 this year and I have never found a good moisturizer till I got this in my ipsy bag. All other creams left my face feeling yucky, no matter what I used. This absorbs immediately, is soothing and lasts all day. My skin is noticably more even, brighter and the scaly spots have completely dissaprared. Its worth the price!!!! It's almost too good to be true.",1
"Good lotion, but scent is strong.",1
"Love this shampoo. Leaves hair soft and fresh, no scalp irritation. Can be used every day without drying hair out.",1
Excellent refreshing shampoo!,1
The results take about 4-6 weeks to see but this stuff works! Cheaper than the prescription option.,1
Nice product but very thick.  Others made by this firm are easier to apply.  Nice fragrance.,1
came as expected. quick shipping!,1
Waste of money. I think lost more hair using it.,0
"Nioxin products are fantastic - they have helped me with thinning hair tremendously.  I recommend Nioxin products to all of my friends. I use the shampoo, conditioner, leave in foam, and two or three creme products for detangling - all great.",1
Great color!  I love it...too bad it's discontinued.,1
"Normally this gel is gel-like. This time it's very watery, disappointed.",0
"I bought this product to reduce the appearance of age spots.  Have been using it for a couple months.  It seems to be working, although slowly.  Will have to give it more time to really know how effective it is.",1
Love the colors,1
Clear as water and bottled in a test tube the Calvin Klein CK2 Eau de Toilette Spray is perhaps a product still in the making. I did not know what to think when I first sprayed this fragrance on my body after taking a shower. It smelled like nothing else that I have used. After the third use I have come to like it. Some body spray will let you know you're wearing something without attracting attention. CK2 is one like that. It is not easy to describe and it smells more like a mans fragrance than a unisex one.,1
"Not only is it good for pimples and acne, but it helps soothe my bug bites.  I took off one star because the alcohol makes my skin too dry and flaky.  However, this product works.",1
"I received a sample of this foam which was awesome. The full-sized product was like a bait-and-switch. Was NOT the same and probably won't buy again. It doesn't have the same consistency, doesn't smell the same, it just isn't the same product.",0
There are a few ingredients that I would not use EVER for my face.  For that price tag I want something more organic.,0
Love this product!,1
Did not like it all,0
Color chips and peels after a couple of days.,0
"Quiet, hot but a bit too heavy to hold.  Buttons are not very easy to slide back and forth.  Recommended only if you do not mind holding a heavy hairdryer.",1
LOVE,1
"I find it hard to believe this is a Henckels product. Im a fan of their brand in scissors and kitchen knives. I even own a pair of scissors for hair and they are all german perfect. With this trimmer I expected the same, but the inner cylinder and the outside ring have a huge gap among them. And instead of cutting, it pulls the hair. Very disappointed with Henckels.",0
"This review is from: Clarisonic Replacement Brush Head Twin Pack for Acne Cleansing (Misc.)
Ordered the DEEP PORE CLEANSING BRUSHES and some one threw the wrong brushes into the box. Well accidents happen. Amazon said this 'product is not from them' and caused me loads of grief and aggravation in trying to rectify their error. Calls, letters and a trip to the post office.........not what I expected from you guys. I bought tons of stuff and wonder why your customer service was non existent now?
I think you owe me.
Buyer beware --- is it Amazon or a sub contractor? Big difference in how you are treated.",0
OK. I am still waiting for the item to work. It had not met my expectations. The item is not one that I would buy again....,0
This is not what I've come to expect from hot tools! I've owned several hot tools curling irons in the past and this one is far inferior. It doesn't glide smoothly through the hair and instead sticks as you pull your hair through. Also the first and subsequent times I've used it the thumb handle (I guess that's what you call it) bent while using it after it was heated up. Don't know if this is a knock off or just a bad product by an otherwise good company.,0
"It works great, but you must use DermMatch first as a base for astonishing results.  First you put on DermMatch then Second you fill in with toppik for a full look Third you use hair spray to hold it all together.  If you still need more then just add a little more toppik, it sticks great to the hair spray as well.  The a little more hair spray.  When you are finished you will look like you have a full head of hair.  And it looks real to. Either one by itself doesn't work as good.  If your only going to go with with then DermMatch is a little better.  When you use DermMatch make sure you follow the instructions and tips.  It's like make up for your head.  After you use it you will get good at applying it.  At first it seems a little hard to get the look you want.  If I see spots That need more I apply a 2nd coat after the first coat dries.  It makes it a little darker the 2nd time.  then add toppik.  the toppik gives you a 3 dimensional look.",1
"I love the color and that it goes on easily, and the pencil format! This is my favorite lip pencil ever! It can be very precise when sharpened adequately.  However, I have had a couple of pencils, 2-3, get stuck with the lid on.  A couple of times it has taken a good portion of the pencil, when we finally could get the lid off.  if you have a suggestion for loosening when this happens, I would like to know the technique ... Thank you for generally a great product!",1
Where is the foam? I've used this product before from a beauty salon. This is not the same.,0
"Love the lotion, but I think the formula was changed from a year ago.  The scent is more subtle.  I miss the stronger scent. I use it before bed and the scent is calming.",1
My daughter loves this straightener.,1
"It does not work !!
It does not work when I used it for the first time I was trying to return it but I couldn't know how I can return it ...",0
Best stuff ever !,1
"I've been a fan of the Pink It Over gloss by Origins for over a decade.  This is an adequate doppelganger for that slightly-glittery pink tint, without the minty-ness of the Origins gloss.

The packaging is pretty, but the bottle required real effort for me to open it for the first time.  I actually have marks on the cap from the grip I needed to exert to twist it.  Kind of ruins the effect...

But, then, I buy lip gloss for moisture in cold weather, and, of course, to make my lips look pretty.  On these counts, Smith and Cult succeeds.",1
This is the most fabulous cream you will ever use!!! I read about it on Pamela's House of Edward blog and have been using it since. Bought some for gifts and everyone loves it. A real winner.,1
"I bought this from another site after seeing a Youtuber say it made her broke capillaries vanish.  I've been using this for two months and there has been no change.  I will use up what I have and pray for a miracle but I highly doubt any change will be coming.  I didn't give it one star because it didn't irritate my skin or break me out, but as far as capillaries.. big HUGE fail",0
"I think it may just be the color, but I wasn't impressed. Suppose to be a pale pink and it looked more like I used white out on my nails. Didn't coat evenly and wasn't true to color of picture.",0
Product not living up to expectation.,0
"Does not fit Art of Shaving Brush. Opening is too narrow to fit any part of handle.
Flimsy does not have enough weight to hold brush even if you had one that fit.
Appears to be designed to stick on mirror or something opposite of how it is displayed in picture. There is adhesive tab on back",0
"The smell was a bit strong and perfume-y. But otherwise a great product that does its job well. I use it to give my hair more volume and texture, it worked just as I had hoped.",1
"Big fan of this shave soap. Unlike the beard growing folk of today, I shave at least every other day. Shave soap of this quality will last you much longer than any tube or can of stuff. So good and smells great.",1
Love Image Skincare Vital C!!!,1
"I can forgive the bottle being different, but it smells different (less complex) and doesn't last nearly as long.  Clearly not the same.  Wasted money and lesson learned.",0
I have bought 4 additional rollers so far because they keep breaking. Customer service does not respond.,0
This item came to me on time and packaged well. The issue I have was the plastic top was missing.,0
feels sticky on my skin,0
"Fargen passet meg s bra. Tommel opp, denne vil jeg kjpe igjen.",1
TY seller,1
5 min after shower and you can't smell it.,0
It doesn't work as good as the stuff I buy at a salon! Even using twice as much my hair don't stay spikey like I'm use to but I had 20 dollars in gift cards I needed to use so I went ahead and tried. I won't be purchasing the hair gel anymore!,0
"Love it.  My only negative comment is that it does not have an automatic shut off.  While it is good to unplug, there may be that one moment when you are rushing and forget.",1
Love the fragrance and the way my skin feels after shower!,1
"For a small object, I was charged $12.00 for shipping, which is way to expensive.  I will never buy these again.",0
great product,1
The color is great. But the polish started chopping literally within a few hours of putting it on. I though maybe I just had smuged 1 nail but I noticed several nails were chipping away. Such a disappointment!,0
its like sand paper to the skin. Advice-save your money for something better.,0
"Wife purchased this nail polish. It fell two feet onto the bathroom floor and exploded. On the walls, the floor, the vanity, the tub, the grout. Incredibly difficult to remove without damage. The thinness of the bottle was shocking, and how thin the glass was was very disappointing. Fragile bottle with cheap construction. Look elsewhere if you want to take this with you in a purse or use without extreme caution.",0
"I received this item and it expired 8/14, almost two years ago!  So bummed!",0
This is not the real thing. It's fake and a horrible one at that. If I could put zero stars I would. So disappointed.,0
Leaves your hair shiny and soft.  I read a few reviews talking about how there is a gap. I see what they were talking about it does feel like its not a tight grip as you are straightening your hair but it works great. What I do is I just put more hair to fill in that gap. I love it so far. I have had it for about a month now.,1
"got for mom as a birthday gift, she loved it! just wish the bottles were a little bigger, feels like you's use one up with one spray",1
A little bit tough on my combination skin but still pretty good as I have sensitive skin and this cleanser works well for sensitive skin,1
Worst flat iron ever please don't buy it doesn't even work at all.,0
I have olive skin and don't like using foundation this is a wonderful cover up cream that just feels like a cream smooths out and help cover up some lines,1
"I just love the Calista Tool Hot Rollers. My hair is fine and very straight very hard to keep a curl. These product kept my curls longer . I have other hot rollers products, which was very hard to keep the curl. Thanks now  I do not need a lot of Hair spray.",1
You don't get the streaks that occur with liquids.  You need to use often to get the result you want.,1
"great toothpaste , refreshing ,",1
Works great!,1
"I have used this product before and like it.  However, this is the first time I have sent to Amazon for it.  It works well and stays on.  A good product.",1
Have been using daily for over a month - no noticeable difference in my dry cuticles.,0
Proraso is a very good shaving soap and have consistent performance in shaving with rich texture lather. I have regularly used this brand and will continue to use them.,1
Tried this after having issues with other shave soaps.  No irritation and a clean smooth shave,1
Product was not easy to apply....bought the IT cosmetic product and it is much easier to apply...wish I would have returned it before 10/5/2016!,0
"It was not sealed with the plastic sleeve, looks like it's a used or a display sample, bad experience I ever had, strongly not recomended to purchase this!!!!!! don't spend high price to buy used stuff!!!!!!!",0
I was surprised to receive RED nailpolish. This picture is deceiving. I was expecting a pink color. It shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate.,0
"I cancelled my order after realizing that the sellers here are selling UNBOXED product.  There is no way to tell expiration without the box.  Why else would they be 70% off?  My wife loves this product and I'll be looking for other options.  Having worked in retail for a number of years, a good rule of thumb is that anything over 60% off the MSRP starts to raise red flags for me.",0
Awesome product.,1
"This is the new version of splendide mani.  This one is thin, smells bad and feels icky on my hands.  What happened to the original?",0
Too soft for me. Could not apply properly,0

It cut through months of water proof makeup as well as some stains from my 31 DAYS OF HALLOWEEN that I did in October. I got new brushes for Christmas and I haven't thought about washing the ones from October. I did and they are so clean now! My only complaint is that I hit the bottom of the dish by the time I was done.  I will be repurchasing! It smells so good too! The video is an example of my ""baking brush"" that was CAKED with powder and now it's so clean!",1
"This is my favorite hair curler.  It gives me some lift and works well on layered hair as long as I do it in sections.  I wish the handle didn't get so hot by the upper lip, otherwise it would get 5 stars.",1
"Good color and fruity smell, and goes on so easily.  Very moisturizing.  Doesn't last very long on the lips, though.",1
I like other Framesi products but not the shampoo and conditioner.  The smell is awful.,0
"The idea is great, and it was easy to apply which is a plus! The color was yellowish orange though on my fair skin. Did not look natural.",0
"If I had known this was travel size, I would have never bought it.",0
Made my scalp super itchy. Stopped using it after using for a week.,0
a little expensive but they are generously sized,1
"I get super dry hands, and no matter what I do in terms of lotion, my cuticles are always a little ratty, so I was really hoping this stuff would be helpful.  And while it doesn't actually melt away my cuticles, it does make clipping them a lot easier/more comfortable. I'm not sure it is really worth $20, but I'll see how long it really lasts before making any calls in terms of value.",1
The cold shot button didn't work.,0
This is a good product and was received very promptly. I highly recommend using this vendor all the time. The service provided was very good.,1
"Great texture and feel, not sure if I notice any big difference in my skin overall, but I don't use it daily as I should.",1
"It showed up like a second hand product. No wrapping plastic frame and the little gift items (I.e. Nail polish sticker)disappeared.

But it works just fine",0
Good flat iron for the price.,1
Great for curling and adding body,1
This has been the worst experience I've ever had with a trimmer.  It just doesn't hold the charge.  It stays in the charger all the time so I have no idea as to what the problem is.  Within the first year it was replaced with a new one and the new one is doing the same thing.  Very disappointed!!  Going in search of a brand that works.,0
This shampoo does not have much scent when you are using it but there is a strong chemical scent that last for a dozen shampoos. If you are sensitive to chemicals this is not for you.,0
"This product holds, but leaves hair needing a shampoo before it can be styled again.",0
Not worth it.  Did nothing for me. Will pass next time.,0
Does as advertised..... Really like the scent,1
"This blows all my expensive Aveda stuff out of the water. It smells better, gets my hair much cleaner, and leaves it soft.",1
"These are so cute on your wrist, but the second you use them for a hair tie the stretch out, fray, and become twisted. I would recommend these as a bracelet, but never as a hair tie.",0
"In the defense of this product I do have extremely fine hair. However, I have used products that boast that they are thickeners and they have worked better than this. I don't even notice a tiny difference in my hair. Plus, the fragrance isn't anything special. I can buy a less expensive product and at least get some results and my hair will smell great all day. I really wanted to love this but it just doesn't work for me.",0
There is no shampoo out there like Gold Lust Shampoo & Conditioner! This product literally brought my hair back to life after years of heat styling and a bad dye job. My locks will never be dry again! definitely worth the investment.,1
"I don't have sensitive skin yet, I used this product once (as the directions said) & my face got so dry that when I moved my face it quaked & started to bleed. I heard so many great things about this product that I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. So upset! Now I have a full tube and will never use it again. Hope it works better for you.",0
"The boxes were not in a good shape, but the shampoo seams have the same quality as I had before.",1
"A+, 100%, 5 stars. Seriously I can not love this facial spray any more. I use it several times every day so I get huge bottles online from Amazon. This spray smells amazing like a very subtle rose and is so hydrating and cooling. I use it after hyaluronic acid serum to lock in hydration and throughout the day for extra pep. I also use it as an essence after my toner to help my serums absorb better. It has worked wonders and is an AMAZING value. I highly recommend this product. I can't imagine that it would cause anyone's skin to react because it only contains very gentle and natural ingredients so definitely give it a try!",1
"Owned a Hot Tools Curling iron since I was 16 - it would curl my hair fabulously, with no products, and stay all day.  After 16 years of use the spring was done, so I decided it was time to order a new one - bought this, and curl wouldn't even stay by the time I had finished curling the other side even on the hottest setting.  I wish I had kept the old one and tried to repair it instead.",0
"We purchased this for my wife who has really curly hair.  Once we read the directions, we realized you really need to be a pro to do this.  We are sticking with their Anti-Curl product which is easy to apply.  If you apply this product wrong, it could really damage your hair.",0
My hair is to short for this .... so it's not Chi's fault I just needed the clip to be longer .,0
not what I was looking for- wanted the oil not water. Have ordered the oil & will keep the water to give to someone.,0
Very thin pads. Hard to separate. So so.,0
"My hair felt nice after but in my opinion, the smell is a deal breaker. I can't believe this passed test groups. Ew. I just washed my hair again and can still smell a trace of it lingering. Can't wait for that to go away! Yikes.",0
My product was not sealed. The box was easily opened without any seal and the bottle was not sealed.,0
I love this cleanser. It's absolutely the best I've ever used,1
"I bought this hair dryer to use at home. I travel Mon-Thursday and take a different travel size dryer with me on the road. I used this dryer a total of about 30 times when it started to sound like there were marbles in the motor and then smoke and a wierd smell came from it. It was past the time to be able to return it so I contacted T3 to let them know what happened. They offered to sell me an extended warranty for $65,pay shipping and handling both ways it would turn out I be spending another $120 to ""replace"" the $100 dryer I used 3 times. The travel dryer I have had which i bought from Walgreens for $29 has been working like a charm for 3 years now. This product is not worth the expense. I expect a $100 dryer to last longer than 30 uses.",0
"Doesnt even heat up good, nor does it curl well.. I thought it would be wonderful as a salon style, it did not work as planned...",0
Much better for my very dry sensitive skin than a scrubbing mask.,1
I had an allergic reaction to this. Embarrassing rash mustache.,0
Good pomade. Excellent value as a bulk purchase...The tin container is hard to epen,1
"I wear heavy liquid foundation every day, so I need something really powerful at night to take off my makeup. This is hands down the best product I've used for makeup removal. A half pump will take off about 90% of my makeup and the rest (mostly around the eyes) I'll wipe off with a facial cloth. I'd expect a product like this to retail at $50, so while $20 is kind of expensive, it's worth it and will last me around 3 months.",1
"This just rolls off, doesnt absorb. Came in pretty roughed up box.",0
product kept leaking and top came off,0
It stopped my scalp from itching but it was harsh on my hair and really stripped the color. It's not a color treated shampoo.,0
Disappointed in the product does. It do what it says it can do.  I order based off the positive reviews however it did. It work on me.  Do not order save your money.,0
"This cream is amazing. It has a strong camphor scent when first applying, but it goes away quickly. It's so great for very dry cracked skin.",1
"I thought this lip gloss would stay on for several hours, that is reason I ordered it, but it has to be reapply several times a day.  Also too much of the product comes out at one time and it get's all around my lips and on my teeth.  Would love to return it now, but their return policy says I'm unable to return now, I kept thinking it would get easier to apply the more I used it, but that does not seem to be happening.  It does not live up to the ""stay all day""  statement, I feel like I have been cheated, I was wanting something that I would only need to apply a couple of times a day and that would not require clean up after being applied.  Very unhappy with product and return policy",0
Nothing special won't buy again,0
"Color is beautiful but nail polish chipped same day it was applied. The sparkles were difficult to apply, it wanted to stay in a clump. Not worth the price I paid.",0
"Had a laser treatment and the spa did not have the product to sell me after my service. They were waiting for their next shipment. This really helped me and soothed my skin like it says it does.

Thanks!",1
I agree that it softens and lifts the beard for a close and comfortable shave. Protects the skin from irritation and razor burn and leaves your skin smooth and moisturized.,1
"This powder is more like translucent powder rather than a base.  It has very light coverage that does not last more than a couple of hours (if that long).  The color is a bit pasty and flat and simply sits on the surface.  While using the foam pad included with it, most of the product remains on the pad, while using a brush to apply, it flies all over the place with product loss.  I feel that it is best applied with your face a bit moist in order to secure the powder in place.  Personally I will not purchase again, I am not happy with the quality.",0
"The skin is allergic neck side piece shape is red, urticant!",0
Its all fake! I feel so angry!!!(,0
"Followed directions, with base coat, polish and top coat.  Chipped and peeled back the very next day.",0
I have used it twice a day every day since I got it and I don't see much improvement,0
"This is not a good flat iron, period. It doesn't straighten my hair, just makes it frizzy. Ive had much cheaper irons that do a better job.",0
"Smells great looks neat, albeit expensive for a candle, would like to purchase more than one however won't be due to the cost.",1
I took this to Cyprus for vacation and still got a tan where I didn't want one... on my face.,0
"Great for thinning sides, but be sure not to use too much, it may be noticeable.",1
nice piecey hair,1
"Bought this for getting the glossy eyelid look. This was not glossy, but super glittery. Waste of money.",0
Favorite!!!! <3,1
"I did not get the smooth hair I was expecting.  Maybe this works better for people with curly hair, but my straight hair that gets frizzy it didn't do anything for.",0
Poor quality. Polish was very thick and made it extremely difficult to use.,0
"This eyelash curler is terrible!!! I repeat terrible!! It's so small there's no way to use it unless your a child! I'm so shocked, I thought it was a joke!!",0
"Icky stuff :-/. This is somewhat like eye shadow for your hair.  At first I thought it was great, but when I realized it rubs off on pretty much anything and stains whatever it gets in contact with.... yikes, not so good.",0
"AB is my favorite I love these, they make your space smell so wonderful!",1
"love this product. my nails are longer, stronger and growing faster.
I was a nail biter but when I started to use this, I saw how great my nails could be and stopped!",1
Helps my dry hands immediately.  Not greasy & great fragrance,1
Pricy,1
"Rarely have ever received so many complements on a scent as with this. Good product, would buy again.",1
Thanks,1
"I, luckily, have only used the Tria Facial Laser twice. I am 59 years old and yes, I do have wrinkles and crows feet...it's called the natural progression of aging.

I have made peace with my crows feet, but I don't like the fine lines which has gotten WORSE since using Tria. I'm just grateful that I've seen the weird results with Only TWO applications.

Long story short, do t do laser!!!! I ha e new mouth lines within two days from this device.

My advise- wear sunblock every time you go outside. If you need a tan to feel better about yourself, there are newer and more natural products. #1 is SUNBLOCK. I'm adding a pic of my daughter. She is 41. I preached the use of constant sunblock.

P.S. During my 2nd treatment today. I immediately had weird dents under my nose.  New lines around my mouth. Do NOT use this devise.!!!! Thank GOD I never bought their latest laser for under the eyes. I can't even imagine the damage!",0
This is not even close to the correct scent. This is lilac or something.,0
"It is shampoo, and it does thicken. Bottle arrived poorly packaged, broken and most of the contents had leaked out.  Enough remained to see if I liked it. Perhaps it was that the bottle had cracked open, but  this product has virtually no scent. If it were labelled ""Unscented"", I don't think anyone would be the wiser.  Considering the cost, I expect a product that is supposed to be Lemon Sage scented to have a noticeable and pleasant fragrance. Not true of this product. Would not risk ordering again.",0
well I used this product for 6 weeks-0-- i try so many products but this one I stuck with since it calmed my skin and began firming - after a few weeks of use by acne that was once under control for years came back! :(  I kept going with it for a couple more weeks and i noticed tiny bumps appearing and again some acne -- sadly i had to discontinue use.  It was GREAT on my fine lines and improved firmness!  I wish they would come out with a acne line.  I wonder if i would have used it longer the acne would have eventually disappeared? I am going to try skin biology now and if that does not work then i am coming back to this cream and incorporating my retin-a for acne! ugh.,1
"Not super long lasting and not overly strong. Love it. Perfect day time perfume. It is energizing. I don't think it is sweet... It smells more flowery/ spicy to me. Men love this smell. This was a blind purchase, but I am satisfied. Jimmy choo is very consistent",1
"Received correct brush, but ordered black,but received a bright RED one.
No notice that another color would be automatically substituted until received. The invoice stated it could be one of several colors, but not stated before ordering.
My husband has used this brush for many years, but did not want a RED brush.",0
My hair feels like my hair again.,1
Just didn't work for me. My hair actually seemed drier. It does smell wonderful though.,0
You can get this perfume at many other websites for 1/2 the price. Look closely at the label 100 ml=3.3 oz.,0
"i recieved a sample of this from ulta cosmetics, and loved it. the smell was amazing.
however, with this certain product, the smell is very off and not the same. i don't know if it's a slightly different version or what.",1
This is the BEST  so far......,1
Really dried the skin in the areas I used it and created redness.,0
"It's heavy and the wind is powerful, it makes my hair dry very fast.",1
leaves my skin feeling really smooth,1
"nice that it stands up on its wide cap, but the mint is overwhelming...far too strong.",0
"Same elegant, expensive, not long lasting smell as majority of other Oribe products ( either great smell or perfume free), although not making a whole lot of difference in the care of my mid length, naturally curly, dry, freeze prune hair, also dyed with natural hair colors, I like it better than dry texturing hair spray. Daily use and also as needed of light moisturizing cream and gold lust oil is more efficient for me, I live in low humidity Colorado. I don't think I would buy it again since other Oribe products are much better for my hair type in my climate.",1
Only used 3 times before it broke and will not heat again.,0
"Love the concept and the lightweight brush.  It doesn't get hot enough to straighten my curly hair.  I still have to flat iron afterwards.  If this were high wattage, it would be better.",0
I love this Jane Iredale lipstick.  It goes on smoothly and the  color is perfect for me.  The slim design of the tube makes it easy to carry in a pocket.,1
Knock off product! Don't purchase!,0
"Worked for awhile, then crashed and burned.  Literally.  This item burned my hair and then stopped working, altogether.  Amazon's return policy blurb referred me to the Hot Tools Professional ""store"" policy . . . Item must be returned within nine months.  $35.00 (the price is now lower) didn't break the bank, but I don't consider a styling tool at this price to be disposable. I guess they do.",0
"I purchased this blow dryer as a gift for my mom earlier this year in February 2015. She has been loving it until this morning. When she turned it on, it wouldn't operate, made a funny noise, and got really hot. I expected better quality from Babyliss and would expect a dryer to last longer than 8 months. I see that the product has a 3-year warranty, but am unsure how to take advantage of it. Will Amazon replace the item, or do I need to contact the manufacturer directly?",0
"I really love the smell of this conditioner.  I bought it to help bring out my curls.  It does help create curls.  I found that it is a little runny, and my hair doesn't feel as soft as I imagined it would.  However, I think I would buy it again and alternate with a thicker conditioner.",1
"I debated whether i should get this or not, it did definitely not make a difference for me. if you buy as ergular day cream okay, but not for spor correction benefits. i would not recommend it for this purpose.",0
"Great, really works, just don't do anything right away, still need a little while to dry completely.",1
Paying for the brand. Doesn't clear acne,0
"This worked well to lengthen lashes - for a week. After that, the formula became gunky. I tried to work with it for another week before throwing in the trash.",0
This is the best sunblock ever. Lasts longer than other sunblocks and it doesn't clog my pores like some of the other products. Highly recommend!,1
"I do not wear perfume. I haven't since Clinique ""Happy"" came out back in the 90's . I make my own now, out of essential oils/coconut oil and I have been super happy with that for a decade. Lacoste Sparkling Eau de Toilette .....is a game changer. OH I remember Lacoste back in the 80's, my preppy older sister used to wear the clothing and I used to make fun of her. I thought I would maybe like this, because of its supposed scents: French Macaroons, Jasmine, Patchouli..Fruity. I actually really love it, and I love how it is not so strong that you regret even spraying it anywhere near you. You aren't supposed to smell like a whorehouse, you are supposed to have a subtle scent about you like a breeze over a flower garden.",1
For some reason it seems different from when I purchase it in the store.,0
It takes forever to dry and applies horribly...,0
Great!,1
"It smells great, but it has this waxy feel to my skin after washing. Not worth the money.",0
I thought this would be black eye liner with some speckles of glitter.  But it has a metallic look which I do not like.  Am not buying again.,0
"It never did anything for me at all, it would dry my face where I put it on but not in a helpful way. My skin is consistently clear now and I still wouldn't use it for anything.",0
"I consider this one of the little luxuries of life.  It's expensive, and I could live without it, but I choose not to.  I've been using Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger shampoo and conditioner for about 5 years now.

I have long hair and I wash it daily.  PM AWG products have proven to be superior to any other products I've ever used.

By ""superior"" I simply mean ""I"" like them better.  My hair feels and looks its best using these products..  This is highly subjective, of course, so you will judge for yourself.",1
"At first feels like it is going to be great, you put in wet or damp hair and it practically turns to water. After it dries there is somewhat of a hold but to say it is ""cement"" is completely wrong.",0
The smell is quite off-putting and nothing like the other Surface products that I have purchased at my barber.  The Surface wax has a pleasant smell like a proper expensive product.  This paste has a weird almost fake minty smell.,0
Worth the purchase.,1
"I purchase mustela products quite frequently from Target, but now we have moved, and I'm running out of my products, and I have no target to go to! So i ordered online. Should have listened to the others who said it smelled bad. It does. It's over powering, and when you smell your baby with a poopy diaper, mixed with the lotion, it just reminded me of a litter box. And i haven't had cats for years..!",0
This lasts very long. It helps with pimples but isn't a miracle worker. Not sure if I will buy again.,1
"Ahava is produced in small ""settler"" communities of the West Bank.  This use of conquered territory is illegal by international law.  Palestinians are not allowed to even go to the Dead Sea - it is surrounded by a ""military"" area which keeps them out.  This is their land which has been stolen.  Do not buy this product!",0
Love the Glytone - Amazon has best price.,1
Im really picky about mascara. I already have thick dark lashes and like a mascara to curl and separate. This is so clumpy and thick. I have to wipe off most of the product to get a decent application.,0
"Average, my previous hair wax came in a tube and was easier to use.  I don't think the cost justifies the quality of this product.",0
I give it only one star..delivery was very fast! But the picture made it seem like the barrel was thick as soon as It arrived I was disappointed it was very small and I have long thick hair..this is a curling iron for women with short hair!,0
"Excellent purchase. Love it so much, had to reorder.",1
"While the eye cream is nice, very smooth, non irritating, and sinks into my eye area without being too oily or heavy. The dispenser leaves a lot to be desired. Such as, consistent usable. Sometimes I press the dispenser and just enough comes out, and application with the applicator wand is easy. Other times it shoots a ton that goes all over. Then there are times that it seems all jammed up.
When it works it's alright, though I've stopped using the applicator wand in favor of my fingertip for applying because I can feel it going on more even in less time than trying to maneuver the skinny tip applicator.
So good product, interesting design, just needs a little more work or a classic pump to get it off the ground for me.",0
"I loved the hair dryer when I first received it!!  It makes your hair so smooth and easy to style.  The first dryer stopped heating.  I ordered the dryer again and now 5 months later, the dryer works for 2 minutes and shuts off due to overheating.  There is something wrong with the heating element.  The refund period is over and it would cost more to ship it back.....Buyer beware!!!!",0
"The product arrived promptly and packaged well.  This conditioner helps make your hair feel so soft & detangles with only a small dab.  And the tub will last a long time, so it's worth the price. Love it!",1
"I am a sucker for the cosmetic counters even when I know that the ingredient is what I should be looking for.  Chemicals are chemicals and don't change.  In my effort to try to be better informed about serums for my aging sking (58 years old) I spoke to my dermatologist.  She reiterated what I knew to be true.  Look for the proper ingredients and don't expect miracles.  I was about to spend about $150 on a Lancome serum and then decided to go with this one because my dermatologist suggested her mother used it and liked it.  The dermatologist carried the line and told me if I did not like it I could bring it back.  I used the product at night for 7 days and love it.  It definitely makes my skin feel smoother.  It also seems to have cleared up some of the blemishes and slight imperfections in my skin.  I also like the smell, it seems like pomegranites or something kind of sweet smelling.  The price is much better than the cosmetic counter products and it was recommended by a dermatologist and it works.",1
"I am not a verified purchaser, however, I found this perfume on clearance at TJMaxx today.  I checked Amazon's ratings and decided to give it a try.  I am in my fifties, tend to like sandalwood, amber, and musk, and found all three in this perfume.  Really pleased I bought it and plan to but it again in the future!",1
"I have been searching for a perfect shave for nearly ten years, and I made it one step closer this morning when I used Proraso Eucalyptus & Menthol for the first time.

I have tried my fare share of shaving creams. I have used Edge Pro Gel, Gillette Gel, plain old store brand shaving cream, American Crew shaving cream, and most recently the sensitive skin formula from Edge Pro Gel. None gave me a shave like Proraso. That in combination with a wide array of razors.

When I finished my shave this morning, my skin felt smoother than it ever before. It still does, hours later. It smelled great, it felt great, and it gave me a great shave. I can't complain. After everything I have done to improve my shave over the years, this was the single best step. Really.",1
It's ok ... wouldn't get again ... does nothing that can't be done with regular soap and water and or alcohol.,0
"I bought mine 4 years ago and it worked great while it was in good shape. Hadn't used it for a while and took it out today. The plastic coating has become both brittle and gummified! Whatever I touched stuck to my fingers and some even broke off. I had to throw it away because this just isn't safe to use any longer. I hate having to throw away something so expensive, but there was no way it was going to work and would have to be totally replaced.",0
"It seems to work ok, but it's so light that I feel like I am going through it fast and it doesn't quite ever feel like I put enough on. It's just too light and watery for my tastes. I feel I will spend more money using this version than a thicker one.",0
"I have been using the products from this brand for some time, and I have used the  eye cream in the past with great results. What I love about this cleansing foam is that the pump dispenser dispenses easily, it dispenses the exact amount that I need to wash my face and no more and no less, it dispenses the liquid in a foam so it rinses easily away and cleanses evenly without getting too much or too little on some places of my face, and it is a highly effective cleanser that strikes just the right balance between cleansing and moisturizing.

I usually use the lush brand of facial cleansers, but I find them a little difficult to use because you need to take a pea sized bit out of the tub, mix it with water, and then spread over your face and hope that you don't get a clump stuck near your hairline or on a dry part of your cheek.

While I have tried other brands of facial cleanser in the past, I have found that most cleansers strip my skin and leave it feeling itchy, or worse, leave a residue that makes me break out. I was surprised to find that this cleansing foam was 100% on par with the quality and results I usually get from using the lush brand, yet it was so much more pleasant and easy to use.

I would definitely recommend this cleansing foam, and now that I have tried it, I foresee myself using it regularly and purchasing it once this testing sample runs out.",1
"This is a good conditioner for cutting down on frizz. Be careful though, it can work too well and make your hair look greasy.",1
"This foaming cleanser is not too thick and doesn't overly dry my skin. Use in the shower to wash my face in the morning and it felt soft and clean, but not dry or tight. Gentle enough for my somewhat sensitive skin.

I'm normally a basic Simple or Cetaphil wash user, so not sure I'd spring for this on a regular basis, but it is a good-sized bottle that should last quite a while, and I like the foaming aspect.",1
This item did not go well with my skin. I broke out using this soap. I am allergic to this.,0
Beautiful to my skin ! Great product !,1
"Good power, dries hair really fast",1
What a waste of money. Tried many many treatments and it never worked. I just want the consumers to beware.  It does not work and you can't get your money back. Sandra Baumann,0
Not happy with the result,0
That's the best facial sun screen I have ever had. It absorbs well and feels light on the skin.,1
"The only nia24 product I don't like. Not only does it leave white film on my skin but it also irritates it
 I prefer all natural think baby sunscreen and andalou naturals skin perfecting beauty balm.",0
Opened box and used product. Showed as photos.,0
I was surprised to receive RED nailpolish. This picture is deceiving. I was expecting a pink color. It shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate.,0
"This La Roche-Posay Toleriane Teint in ""Golden Beige"" is darker in tint than I expected.  It dispenses and applies easily, but there's a strong alcohol smell and it feels tight and drying if you have dry skin.  It's definitely not hydrating as advertised and like other reviewers have mentioned, it feels chalky.  The primary ingredient, after water, is silcone (dimethicone), which I don't think is ideal since it can feel heavy.  Also, there's no SPF.

I found the coverage kinda of grainy, too.  I like that this is made in France, but I don't see any other reason to get this when there are other mid-market and drugstore options that are better.",0
"This is truly an AWESOME product!! The first time I used it was in a nail salon - so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon!! Not only does it smell good it really does the trick and my heels are not cracked and dry!! And an added bonus the heel therapy is not sticky and doesn't get all over the linens!!
GREAT PRODUCT!!!",1
too heavy and shaves awful,0
Keeps hands soft,1
"I have used this product for years, but this item does not have the scent, consistancy, or quality of Achipelago Botanicals.",0
Truth be told this is the worst top coat I've ever bought next time I'm going to the nail & HAIR supply shop they have better and it's bigger and less money not worth the money,0
"I want to like this lotion. Price is right, seems like it should be a good deal, but it just isn't. I can't really tell any difference in my skin in term of acne. However, every time I use it, I put my primer on over it and then my foundation and the lotion just rolls off. Makes a huge mess and feels like I'm just peeling off the lotion. I'd use it only at night, but that's when I use my Retin A.",0
"I've been using this moisturizer on my supersensitive dry skin for years. It does its job beautifully without any greasiness. I've tried others, including some extremely expensive ones, but I always come back to Avene. There's just nothing like it.",1
"I LOVE this eyelash curler, but mine break and I have to replace them every few months. Maybe I am just pressing too hard?",1
I never use it yet. I tried to practice but too difficult for m to use. lol,1
It's perfect.,1
"Great coverage, hides all my flaws",1
Iv only used it 3 times and I believe to be seeing a difference.,1
"This is a replacement product for their original product called Solar Protection. This product is ok, but I liked the other one much better.  It was tinted as well and it covered much better in a more opaque way and you didn't have to wear makeup over it.  I notice I get more sun damage with this product and I always wear a large brimmed hat and lots of sun screen.",0
"The product that I received was either old, defective or a knockoff.  After about 3 applications virtually no pigment is left or it is dried out.  Whatever the case, this product is a ripoff.",0
"My wife saw this on a morning show and liked the looks of it, so I bought it for her birthday.  Once seeing it ""in real life"" she realized it wouldn't work for her, as she likes to put ice in her water bottle and the opening is not large enough for ice.  No problem, we'll return it.....but wait....this item is not eligible for returns.  Wait, what?  I buy from Amazon constantly, and this is the first time that has ever happened to me (unless I waited too long, which is my fault).  I guess we blew almost $50 for a trendy ""warm"" water bottle.",0
I was happy with my purchase.,1
"Have purchase this product for years. This last jar was way below usual freshness. First of all, it looks like cottage cheese instead of mousse. On top of that there is practically no scent. I usually receive compliments on my scent as it is luscious;nhowever this time nothing. My only thought is that it is from old stock which is very disappointing. Sorry it has taken me this long to review. I will probably not buy this again from them or Amazon. I am already on the search for a new product. Just very disappointed.",0
"I've used the Archipelago Botanicals Milk bar soap and I don't think this smells much like that.  Not very fond of this fragrance.  It's kind of mild and not terrible, just not like the bar soap.",0
"Best eye cream, great results.",1
"I have been used it once/day after bath.
I am in the begging of pregnancy but I expect no Stretch until the end of pregnancy.",1
"I used to use this item before and I know the feeling when you use it.  When you apply, you feel very fresh and invigorating feeling to your scalp, but this one has a same scent but the feeling is different.  I am just planning to buy same product from CVS and compare them.  If it is different,.. I guess it is not good.",0
Fast shipping fair price,1
"Be aware of the reviews here! Most of the five star reviews are not real. If you click ""see all my review"" next to these five star reviewers, you'll see these reviewers haven't given many reviews, and almost of all of their reviews are on em cosmetics. And yes you guessed it! All of these em cosmetics reviews are five stars. Only one of the reviewers was honest on another em product that she's an employee. It's obvious that Michelle got her employees, family and friends to write these reviews.

Now onto the products. I was very excited when her line came out that I got almost everything from her line. Her products are okay, about drugstore quality, but definitely not worth the price. They have poor pigmentations and are not very long lasting. I don't recommend her products unless you can get them at 75% off.",0
"I love this perfume a lot and even bought my second bottle.  The smell is very refreshing and light. A little of tea and citrus smell.  The only problem is the smell doesn't stay whole day.  By end of the day, I can barely smell it.  And it requires more sprays to be noticeable, so a bottle won't last that long compares to the other brand that I used.",1
"I've really enjoyed this moisturizer. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist. Perfect fit for my skin. I have normal to dry and it does go on a bit greasy, but I only use a small amount and it feels great on my skin. I let it set for a couple minutes before adding my makeup over it.",1
Bad quality. I bought two other Stila stay liquid lipstick colors they are very natural looking and stay long I love them... this one looks very cheap to wear with weird texture.,0
"I was actually quite disappointed with this product. With the hot tools brand name I was sure it would be high temp and create a great curl - no such thing. It's also not gentle on hair.. it catches tiny hairs and plucks them out, ouch! I've had better curl from drug store irons. Choose another!",0
"Not nearly as good as the original shampoo on the HAL ships. I am sorry I purchased it :( It not only looks different, but it feels, smells, and cleans differently.",0
Wonderful!,1
"This did not do anything for me.  Maybe there is something else I missed during the instruction.
Just does't worker me !!!!!",0
Tiny tube of basic cream.,0
I am obsessed with this product!! I no longer need to deal with the agonizing process of applying false eyelashes because this stuff really does the trick. Might seem a little pricey but well worth it.,1
"The product did not appear as genuine as I expected. Same product bought directly at a store had more body, more texture. This one seemed watered down although it does clean.",0
I didn't like the texture or smell. It didn't seem to work any better than Palmers which is a lot cheaper.,0
"DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS IT IS FROM DIRECT MFG. THAT WILL GIVE YOU MONEY BACK IF NOT SATISFIED!! I bought this from the natural health shoppe, and I got stuck keeping a product that doesn't work-they would not refund any opened product!! How else was I going to see how it worked? I guess this is good for people that have used it without any problems or are satisfied with this product.",0
"I don't love the smell but it really seems to make my hair look and feel better. You also don't need a huge blob to fully condition hair, a little goes a long way.",1
good,1
"This is the greatest hair care product I have ever tried. I have really fine, oily hair and usually products just weigh it down and make it look limp. This stuff is really weightless. It detangles better than anything I've else I've ever used, smoothes frizz, and adds shine. It can fix pretty much any bad hair day. No matter how much I use, it never weighs my hair down.",1
"I was looking a mascara with better hold but slightly less toxic and therefore more protective of my lashes. This mascara is terrible, I am really puzzled by the positive reviews:

1. really, really wet, the application is a nightmare, I had to fiddle with it for 20 minutes to make it acceptable and my face was covered in this stuff
2. the coating concept is cool, but in actuality, I find that because i have to apply pressure to remove it thoroughly, it PULLS OUT my eyelashes. I lose at least 2 whenever I wear this, and other reviewers have stated it makes their lashes fall out too. CAVEAT EMPTOR
3. CLUMPY af
4. ZERO volume, I already have fairly thick lashes but this still gives a terrible effect with the clumpy, spidery long look

The only positive thing I can say is that the hold is indeed enduring.",0
"Well, I did like this curling iron a lot, but after owning it two years and using it probably once a week the purple paint began peeling off and I would find it in my hair so I had to throw it out.  Two years doesn't seem like a long time for a curling iron compared to all the others I've owned in my life.",0
Product was delivered opened (the cap unscrewed)...powder was all over the box and packing air pillows.  Disappointed with the mess and am not sure how much actual usable product is still in the bottle.  Waste of money.  With respect to what I could salvage...it worked well.,0
Product is stingy in amount of eyeliner in tube.,0
love the smell just wish it lasted longer,0
"This is a nice sunscreen for several reasons.  It's very light in texture and absorbs into the skin nicely without leaving residue on the skin.  (It looks kind of bumpy coming from the tube, but there are no lumps in the product, itself.  I'm not sure why it looks like it does coming out of the tube.  But it doesn't interfere with the performance of the product, so I don't worry about that aspect of things too much.)

I have had allergic reactions to other sunscreens but I've been using this approximately twice daily for over a week now and have had no problems, whatsoever.  The ingredients are listed on the product page; note that this contains a mineral sunscreen ingredient (zinc oxide) as well as two synthetic chemicals (octinoxate and octisalate).  Octinoxate and octisalate are the two synthetic sunscreen ingredients that seem least likely to cause a reaction.  I think the particular combination of active ingredients offers superior protection (this is SPF 45) while also not causing texture problems (fully mineral sunscreens leave a lot of residue on the skin).

I haven't used this as a makeup primer so I can't speak to that.  However, it certainly wouldn't interfere with makeup because it really does absorb into the skin well -- you're not oily or greasy at all, after you put it on.  It is fairly moisturizing and has a high SPF value, so this should have some anti-aging benefits.  It also contains hyaluronic acid, which is in a lot of anti-wrinkle serums.  So this really is a product with multiple benefits in one package (great, since this is a bit pricy).

If it's in the budget for you, this is definitely a good product and one I'm happy I got the chance to try.",1
Great mit but a bit tight if your hands are bigger!,1
"The Japonesque Velvet Touch Concealer is a cream concealer in a pot for relatively full coverage. Instead of a plain pot, it comes in a small compact of shiny black plastic with decorative strokes of purple, pink and white on the top, 1 3/8 inches square and about 1/2 inch deep (4.3 x 1.3 cm). There is a small mirror inside the lid. There are only 1.5 grams (0.052 oz.) of concealer in the compact. I have the 02 shade, which is a little light for my light olive skin. It works well on some areas of my face, but the 03 shade would be better on others. The tone is relatively cool, not warm, and perhaps a little peachy.

I normally use Mac's Studio Finish Concealer, so I compared the Velvet Touch Concealer to that. The Velvet Touch has a very smooth and creamy consistency. It is thick enough to stay in place but not as thick as the Mac concealer. I use a sponge-tipped applicator to get the Mac concealer just on the spot I want it; if I want to cover a large area, I use a brush. The sponge-tipped applicator was not as successful with the Velvet Touch Concealer, but a brush worked very well. The Velvet Touch glides on exceptionally smoothly, and it blends easily using the tip of the brush. I was very pleased with how easily this concealer covered blemishes and blended seamlessly. The Mac concealer blends nicely also, but it requires more work.

As the Velvet Touch Concealer worked so well on blemishes, I had high hopes for it covering hyperpigmentation. This didn't work as well. The Velvet Touch is not heavy enough to cover dark spots or patches. It goes on smoothly and easily with a brush, much more easily than Mac Studio Finish Concealer, but it doesn't cover as well. Dabbing it on with a sponge tip or trying to build it up didn't help much. Dark areas show through. I am very happy with its coverage of blemishes, though. The velvety matte texture is a perfect match for my skin, and it blends nearly flawlessly with a few flicks of the brush. Even without foundation, it is just about undetectable.

As there is increasing concern about the safety of ingredients in cosmetic products, I should mention that this concealer contains propylparaben, a preservative and endocrine disruptor. For the benefit of those with allergies or other concerns, this is the full list of ingredients: isodecyl, neopentanoate, polytheylene, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, isocetyl stearate, ethylhexyl pamitate, mica, silica, vp/eicosene copolymer, synthetic fluorphlogopite, orzanol, tocopheryl, acetate, lecithin, tocopherol, ascorbyl palmitate, glyceryl stearate, glyceryl oleate, citric acid, propylparaben. May contain: CI 77492, CI 77491, CI 77499 (iron oxides), CI 77891 (titanium dioxide). The ""may contain"" ingredients are pigments.",1
Good product.,1
"This is an interesting device for treating periorbital wrinkles or crown's feet around the eyes. It is easy to use and the treatment only takes 2 minutes a day.

The device is small and lightweight. It has a treatment tip that emits invisible laser radiation, an on/off button, and a multi-color light to indicate the device status. It has a non-replaceable Li-Ion battery and that can be fully charged within 2 hours. Charging is done via a standard mini-USB cable and a 5VDC 1A power adapter (both included). There are no user-replaceable parts as the device is designed to last for 3 years or more. It comes with a 1-year warranty.

The device is designed to use around the eyes where you can feel bone beneath the skin. That is, specifically, the area around the outer corner of the eye and below the eye. Never use it on the eye, eyelids or point the laser directly at the eye. You should read the manual in its entirety before using the device for the first time. The is a long list of warnings and precautions that you should know about.

The treatment procedure is simple and easy. Turn the device (the light will lit green),  place the laser treatment tip flat against the skin and glide it slowly in small circular motions, performing multiple passes throughout the treatment to cover the entire area. The device will lit up purple and vibrates when the laser is firing during treatment, so you will get a feedback that it is working. After 1 minute, it will turn itself off. Then repeat the procedure on the other eye. For post treatment care, the manufacturer recommends their Nourishing Eye Renewal Cream. I use my current eye cream and it seems to work just as good.

The laser may cause a stinging and uncomfortable sensation in the skin, as well as redness or swelling in some instances. I tried it on my forearm for the first time as suggested in the manual. It did sting a lot. It felt like a mild burn. It was uncomfortable enough to make me not want to continue. For the sake of a proper review, I continued the 2-minute treatment. My treated skin felt very tender and was a little red. I applied an eye cream to help soothe the skin. Next morning, the redness was gone and I felt better.

The manual recommends a daily treatment plan for 8 straight weeks (do not use it for more than 8 weeks). I'm 2 weeks into the treatment plan now and I can see a difference in the wrinkles. They are noticeably softer and less defined. It does appear that the treatment would actually work. The manual says the best results occur few weeks after the 8-week course. I'll have to revisit this after 8 weeks, but for now, so far so good.",1
"My hair stylist recommended this but was way over priced in the salon.  Luckily, I got it here for $30 cheaper and it's great!  Have been using it for several months and love it!",1
This polish is lighter than I expected it to be. It is also strong. I can smell it through the package.,0
Love product only problem is the pump fails well before the bottle is empty. Otherwise a great product will go back to lotion,0
"I wanted to like this product. I had read about it on a site other than Amazon. I was looking for a good product for my oily hair.  This product was so watery that I couldn't get it from my hands to my hair no matter how hard I tried.  I tried to use it several times, but I finally gave up and threw it away.",0
Only used 3 times before it broke and will not heat again.,0
It does not work well with other top coats unless OPI and sometimes you have customer who have there own pick of top coat.  But OPI top coat is it's friend.,0
Nice night cream but after 3 weeks not seeing anything different.,0
Very moisturizing.,1

"I tried with Julep eyeliner--it doesn't work.  Like another reviewer said, you can turn and turn and it doesn't sharpen.  Doesn't seem to make contact with the blade.",0
"Please note this review is for the MASCARA.  I am currently using the serum, liner and mascara together. I started with the serum only for a month and liked the results, so I added the makeup as well to see what would happen.  As I am over 50,I had been using the serum twice a day; now I am using the serum at night and the makeup in the morning and the results are fantastic.

History: I had eyelash extensions for about a year and really liked the - not having to wear mascara and looking good right out of bed in the morning, but did not like the hassle and expense of maintaining them.  When I stopped getting the extensions my lashes were left short and stubby so I decided to try serum to regrow them.  Did some research and based on reviews here and elsewhere I decided to try GrandeLash.

The mascara is a nice black color.  One coat gives good coverage and fullness.  It is NOT waterproof and does not last all day, so I finish with a coat of waterproof mascara to make it stay put.  I use the GrandeLash liner first, then this mascara with my regular eyeshadow. It's not the best liner I have ever used, not the worst either, but I am giving it a very good review because once I added the liner and the mascara to the serum, the results really amped up.  My lashes are twice their length now and look as good as when I had the extensions.

I have been using for a few weeks now and will update when I re-order as to how long the tube lasts and if there are any other issues.",1
"Maybe it's the style of a clay based pomade, but even after applying alot it didn't hold too well for me. The smell was pretty neutral. I only gave it 2 stars instead of one because the container is nice",0
"It doesn't work.  It left no color and hair felt ""gummy.""  Waste of my money.",0
<3 this toothpaste,1
It does smell good but other than that not really worth it. The aresol can stopped working and I barely used it. Not worth the money.,0
Don't order this crap. Worthless!,0
Love this curling iron! I do not even have to use hairspray for my curls to stay in! A brand that I will continue to use!,1
Runs like water lumpy and discolored it's either heavily watered down or just out right fake will be going to the salon from here on out.,0
"I am a big fan of the Juice Beauty line.  I am a regular user of the green apple peel as well as those regular facial moisturizer.  I was given a chance to try out this clear skin kit and have had great results with it.

My problem area is my forehead.  I have a tendency to end up with clogged pores on my forehead.  It presents as little bumps.  The bumps aren't pimples and definitely not acne.  They seem to be clogged pores.  After a week of using the Clear Skin Kit, the bumps have disappeared.  I have never been able to get them to completely disappear before, so I am very happy.

Each element of this kit has been easy on my skin.  I am sensitive to odors and the scent from these products is minimal and quickly dissipates.  A small amount of each one goes a long way and I estimate that the items should definitely last a month, if not more.  My only quibble is that it's difficult to get the precise amount of product I want out of the tubes.  I often end up squeezing out more than I need.  I wish that instead of squeeze tubes they used little glass jars or tubes with little pumps.

Overall, I am very happy with this kit.  I have seen nice results.  Lastly, I feel comfortable using Juice Beauty products because they don't test on animals.",1
"This  sprinkles out of the container as a powder and sticks to the scalp.  Does not look anything like natural hair as is not as pictured on the video. Thank goodness I got the small size, which I have thrown in the trash.",0

Grossly overpriced for the size....3x more expensive than it should be.,0
"Renewed Hope - does just what it promises.  It is a rich, easily absorbed moisturizer that keeps your skin supple without leaving it greasy.  It feels great after a shave.  The only reason I'm only giving it four stars is because there is an odor when you first put it on, very tart, like sour milk. It fades pretty quickly, but directly after application it can be very strong!  Otherwise, a good product.",1
"Got last 2 from "" Brand Names

"I'm somewhat new to safety razors.  Based on the positive reviews, my first acquisition was a Merkur 34C.  It's a very good razor, but for me (I have long fingers), I felt the handle was a little too short and stubby and had a hard time grabbing it securely.  So I decided to buy this one with the longer handle (23C).  My only complaint is that the 23C has a thinner diameter handle, so although it's long enough, it still doesn't feel exactly right. If it was the thickness of the 34C, I think it would've been perfect.",1

"I have a problem in the winter with the skin on my hands cracking.  I have tried everything and a neighbor suggested this--it is good for men and women, but it is actually just good.  Really good.  The best I have ever tried.  The only one that really worked.  With the brutal winter we had in NY (that never ended), this kept my hands in perfect condition.....LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!",1
"Nice shade, but feels heavy on your lips",0
These are my favorite curling irons...heat up fast ..work great...last a long time...however the one I got from here was gummy and sticky....like it was sitting in a hot warehouse too long and melted a bit...the handle..couldn't touch it was nasty..I returned with no hassle however...purchased somewhere else,0
"4.5 stars!

I would give this 5 stars except that it requires a fair amount to a high degree of skill for finer waxing, such as eyebrows.  Hopefully, practice will eventually make perfect.

This is by far the best home waxing product I have tried.  Usually I use wax strips and they may not work well and can be quite irritating.  Every other spa-like home waxing systems I have tried has been either too much of a mess, or a waxing failure.  This worked wonderfully.

It took about 6 minutes to melt the wax (in 30 second increments) in the microwave.  It is recommended that you stir the wax in between each 30 second increment.  Even though each microwave is different, you can probably start off with a single 90 second microwave blast and then move to the 30 second increments.  The plastic mug handle stays cool so no worries removing the mug from the microwave.

The wax is a pretty sparkly blue.  Mix it well after it is melted.  This is the only part that starts to require skill.  The spatulas do not permit a fine touch for application; unless you are a trained professional. I am not.  It is awesome that the wax does not get hot, only warm.  You do not need muslin.  After the wax has cooled more you pull the wax off directly - nice!

This kit comes with cleaning prep, and prep/post oil.  I would recommend that you purchase more applicators right away.  This particular kit also comes with 30 ingrown hair preventing wipes to use the next day.

This wax was virtually painless.  It did leave minimal redness, much like every type of waxing, but less severe.  All hair was removed with one pass.  That was great and diminishes irritation.  I love the blue color.

After a few uses I am super happy.  Once I am more skilled at application I will be over-the-moon excited.",1
"Love it, I used it when I finish to blow dry my hair, is the best!!!",1
I have been using Revision for 4 years now and just love it.  Have took my best friends but until they were recommend it by there facialist did they start using it and called to tell me about this amazing product.......They could have been looking better 4 years ago.,1
I love this product.  Just wish it had two heat selections.  It doesn't seem to get very hot.,1
"its a great curling iron
only thing is that the handle that makes the iron grab ur hair doesnt close like a normal iron does
so it makes curling my long hair a pain in the butt :/",0
Love this mask!!,1
they have changed this from the nice thick effective cream that it had been into a gelatinous gooey ineffective mess.  I'll never but it again,0
"Potent stuff, use only a little. Very pleasant",1

Very easy to curl with as it handles very nicely.,1
"I bought Rusk Thermal Flat Iron Spray with Pure Argan Oil at Marshalls for $8.99 while on vacation.

  I used the spray as a heat protectant when flat-ironing with a Nano Titanium Babyliss Pro. I would spray lightly over slightly damp hair, and let it dry. I can say that this spray gives good hold - too good. It made my hair as stiff as cardboard, and brittle.

  I thought the spray would work better if sprayed very lightly. Doing so gave me perfect hold without stiffness, but made my hair length look and feel dry and frizzy, and the ends brittle and frayed. The appearance and feel of my hair would worsen throughout the day, as if the spray starts sucking the moisture out of the hair the instant it's applied and keeps depleting moisture until the hair is left dehydrated.

  Finally, I tried just using it as a finishing spray instead on hair curled with curlers, but had the same unpleasant results.

I usually use only natural oils and natural butters (like shea) in my hair, so as the only change in my hair routine, this product had to be the culprit. A few days after I'd started using this spray, my scalp became dry and itchy, and I actually saw a few flakes. It wasn't until I quit using the spray that I realized the spray was the cause of my scalp problems, too.

I had to deep condition three times and cut off an inch of hair before my hair thrived again. Washing my hair with a few drops of iodine diluted in water calmed my scalp and stopped the itching and flaking caused by this product.

I hated to waste an $8.99 product, so I gave the can away, thinking it might work for someone else. The woman I gave it to used it on a synthetic wig, and noticed later that same night that the wig had frizzed out badly. She had to cut her wig in order to save it. She returned the hairspray to me. The spray canister was nearly full when I dumped it in the recycling bin. Money down the drain.

If you make the mistake of buying this product, please test it first on hair that you trimmed off or on fake hair, and you'll see that I am not exaggerating. I don't want to see other people damage their hair unnecessarily. This is the worst product I've tried in my adult life. It's a shame I paid this company so much just to damage my hair and scalp.  This product claims to make hair ""smooth, silky soft, sleek and shiny"" - but beware of the false advertising, because it does the extreme opposite.",0
Love this stuff and have been using it for years.  I really would like to see it cheaper though.,1
"So good, but it is smaller than I thought.",1
"I can't feel the razor's edge protruding between the two parts (top & bottom plates) sandwiching the razor. My results when shaving is nothing near a close shave. At best it leaves a shadow.

Liking,1
"This product works. Use it once a week as directed and it keeps your hair and scalp looking great. I like the big bottle with the pump. It is easier to use that way in the shower. Used with other Tea Tree products, your hair also smells good. Convenience and a product that works is a great advantage. Be sure to follow directions and do not keep this on your hair too long as it does contain natural salicylic acid.",1
not working,0

"This is a neutral color. Put on one coat and it gives the nail a shine. add another coat and you get a slight color I like it because it goes on smooth, no ripples or ridges and it is a great color.  It doesn't take long to dry.",1
"You will pay over $20 to purchase just one of these in Sephora. It's like 9 for the price of one! Colors are fun and I do like the gloss, but if you're a texture person this is not the product for you. It has a thick and gunky feel to it. Definitely not made for kissing!",1
"I bought this moisturizer along with the face wash for my blemish prone, dry skin. It has a weird texture, unlike any other moisturizers I've used. It feels more like an exfoliating face wash when you first apply it because it has little beads in it.
I like this moisturizer because it is very light so it doesn't give me acne, and it moisturizes my dry face, and that's what I want any moisturizer to do for me.
The one thing you should keep in mind when using this is that you only need a pea size of this for your entire face. Somehow I kept squizzing more and then don't know what to do with the leftover moisturizer.",1
Still using it.,1
The primer gel dries up way too fast. Ill never buy this gel again. Ill stick with the original Nuface primer.,0
"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1
16 years ago I bought a Swilling J.A. Henckels ceramic nail file it was a 5 star file . unfortunately I broke it a few months ago and to replace it I finally tracked down this folding file.

"First, thanks to reviewer Nicole.  I didn't understand what this product was until I read her review.

I like this product.  It removes makeup like it says.  I also like that there is no sting like you get from many toners.  It leaves you with just a fresh feeling.

That said, I'm having to pass this on to my Teen daughter because a) I find it irritates my skin, and b) my daughter wears a lot more eye makeup than I do.

As far as the irritation, I have a lot of allergies and super sensitive old-mom skin and what I found is that this left my skin 'burning'.  I rinsed my face with water but the feeling persisted.  I doubt many people will be effected by this but wanted to give other moms with dry, sensitive skin a heads up.

The other thing I want to note is that I felt like I needed to rinse my face after using this product because if felt very slightly sticky/filmy.

SUMMARY
Works but I can't use it because of my super sensitive skin.  I'm giving this product 4 Stars because my daughter didn't notice any of these side effects and it's a super simple cleansing routine.",1
Great in every way (except price).,1

"I got this in an Ipsy glam bag at some point in the last year and have never been able to wear it. Every time I tried to apply it, it WOULD NOT apply. It had the texture and consistency of a cheap wax crayon, and it irritated the skin of my eyelids to even attempt to apply it, even afer warming it up on the back of my hand. The marks I managed to get on the back on my hand were IMPOSSIBLE to wash off even with makeup remover and were chunky and flaky, again, like a cheap wax crayon. It may have just been a bad batch, but this was absolutely TERRIBLE from day one. To top it all off, the color (Jac) looks like literal s***. Finally tossed this with no remorse after giving it one final desperate chance. Absolutely cannot reccomend.",0
"One of my biggest concerns that I will never know the answer is, if this product is legitimate and if it comes from the original manufacture. I called the original manufacture and they said they don't allow third-party sellers and that they can't guarantee legitimacy of this product . ",0

"The serum is great, but the issue is actually GETTING the serum to come out of this hideous jar. 1) no instructions on how to open 2) if you by chance learn to turn the cap while holding the silver ring, the pump works - only for a little while, then nothing comes out.
I went through this 2 times!! First I thought it was a fluke and sent the product back to Amazon, who then with their amazing Customer service sent me a new one.. and then... the same thing happened!!
Except in this second jar I lost my patience and with pliers was able to remove the ""outer tube"".. so I found out the jar has no ""tube"" to pump from the bottom, it is supposed to have a vaccuum effect and the bottom part should slide up and follow the product consumption. No it doesn't work... in order to use it I have to keep the jar upside down to be able to dispense it.
Honestly, they really need to change the packaging!!! I will not buy it again, for the price it is not a good buy.",0

This iron is really mediocre. I wish I had spent an extra $50 for a better product. I have to set the temperature much higher than my previous straightener and it still doesn't get the hair very smooth. I don't even have terribly unmanageable hair -- it's slightly wavy and frizzy. Wishing I could return it at this point but it's too late.,0
I only like Christian Dior sauvage I tried this in the department stores this does not last long the fragrance not even an hour!,0
It was bootleg. I LOVE this product- the real version- but this one had a glued on label and it did not have much product in it.,0
Works to smooth hair and smells great! A little goes a long way. Didn't realize how expensive it is for the 2.5 ounce.,1
"I don't know how to describe the taste, but it's nice, like creamy sweet flowers. I've had people tell me my mouth smells nice after using this toothpaste. If you're looking for something other than burning mint tooth paste, check this one out .
It's wonderful before or after a nice bath. Actually it's just generally nice to have jasmine smelling breath  :D",1
"Now  within a couple months of purchase, the motor seems to be weaker, the spinning is a lot slower and less effective.  I wish I could return it- sad that it is beyond the 30 day window. There ought to be a quality guarantee.",0
Pretty colour but felt like sandpaper on lips.,0
Do not buy this! The brand name is different than advertised,0
Did not meet my expectations,0
Love this perfume. I will continue to buy it from Amazon!,1
ok,1
"After trying it for the first tine,I learned that I don't like dry shampoo,  so I gave it away to a friend.",0
Meh....I am a sucker for these kinds of things. Felt like putting icy hot on my skin. No difference in appearance.,0
I love this line of products. Not cheap but very good stuff.,1
Its OK on the face but it burns my eyes thus rendering it unuseable,0
"Best color. Love the Red, brown colors!",1
My hair is this.  This helps keep it from being so flat.  Easy to use.,1
"This cleansing cream is a little too heavy for me.  I had a hard time removing the cleansing cream, a film is still left on your face. I decided to give it to a friend who has very dry skin, and she likes it.",0
Second time buying this.  Great soap at affordable price.  Will buy again.,1
Best self tanner for fair people. Never turns into alligator look.,0
"I've heard so much about this product and I had to try it so I went to my favorite and only site for ordering things, Amazon. I ordered it and it came 3 days before it was supposed to and I was so happy. When I opened the package the bottom was soaked in the product and i lost about 2/4 of it. I was kinda sad to be honest because i was so excited but i tried it and it was amazing, I also got another one free courtesy of amazons customer service. I just wish it came perfect the first time but it's fine i guess.",0
"Expected to love this, since it's gotten good reviews.  Not a good color for me (I'm on the fair side with pink undertones), and it makes a mess everywhere when I apply it.  Guerlain Terracotta is pricier, but SO much better!!",0
Goes on easily. Not greasy on my skin. Has kept me from sunburning when outdoors. No particular odor. Works great!,1
It's OK. But it doesn't smell like orange at all.,0
Certainly moisturizes your hair!!  I mix it with another conditioner so it doesn't leave my hair too greasy and that works real well. I have psoriasis and this is supposed to help.,1
Some of the best lotion I've ever had. Moisturizes very well an has a great masculine sent without being overpowering. This is my go to lotion from now on.,1
Way smaller than what I had envisioned :(,0
"It's hard to give an objective review when I've only been able to use this about five times before the tip wore down rendering it unusable as I need very thin, soft strokes which a stub cannot give.

There was no sharpener in the package I received. I tried using other brow pencil sharpeners but none worked (they only wore down the tip). The lack of proper sharpener may have affected application but not the other elements (texture, color, look when applied, price/value ratio) that are a part of evaluating this pencil's effectiveness.

I've used a wide variety of eyebrow pencils over the years at a variety of price points. The best are easy to apply in that they don't seem to cake or clump and go on evenly (with a well-sharpened tip) and don't smudge; you can shape the tip as needed to give thicker or thinner lines. The consistency (a bit waxy but not too much), which you can't try before you buy, is a key factor in both application and longevity, once applied.

Other than the color itself, there's nothing that I liked about this product. Which is disappointing as this is a good brand and I've used other Longo products and been satisfied with their performance. It's especially disappointing given the price point.

Application: Not as easy as other pencils, which is due, in part, I think, to the consistency (waxy, clumpy) and the size of the tip (too small and chubby and not thin enough to my liking).

Texture: Not as smooth as other pencils I've used. Took longer to apply and had to keep smudging and fiddling with Q-tips to get a neat line. Didn't go on ""evenly.""

Look when applied: Seemed heavier and line was not as strong and consistent. Getting a thin line was very difficult (again, an issue of consistency and size/shape of product tip)

Color: This was a really good color for me, even though I have medium brown hair. I have found that many products labeled ""blonde"" are the right shade either alone or when used to lighten up a darker color.

Price/Value: Simply not there for me. I've had better application, better looking brows with pencils that were cheaper. But since a person's brows (color, texture, etc.) differ greatly, this may work better for you than me. I have thin-ish brows and need thin, really feathery lines, which this could not deliver.",0
It works!,1
"The good news and bad news for these blades is the same- less sharp than Feather blades. Good because they don't slice up my face quite as much, bad because they need changing slightly more often. However the cost saving versus Gillette products is considerable, so even if it only lasts 5 shaves instead of 7 it's fine.",1
I'd wanted this cologne for my boyfriend for over a year. We finally ordered it without ever smelling it. I wasn't disappointed. This is definitely one of my favorite smells. It's spicy and warm and the longer it's on him the better it smells.,1
Love this eye pencil! Worth every penny,1
"I don't find it holds well and feels heavy. Also in her humid south, my hair falls through he day and it's hard to add more later. The smell is too strong for my liking.",0
wife loved it! great for small gifts.,0
Don't waste your money please. This does nothing for stretch marks. It's just lotion that smells a little nice. For the price that this is... You'll be sorry.,0
"There are better more natural looking products out there, especially for more textured hair types.",0
"I have to say I have mixed feelings about this dry shampoo. First I should start off by saying that when it comes to dry shampoo I HATE the spray can formulas and prefer the loose powder dry shampoo formula, however the loose powder type seems to be getting harder and harder to find :( I find that they sprays don't work that well at all and do not absorb the oils as well as the loose formulas.  My go to dry shampoo is the Oscar Blandi loose dry shampoo but it seems to be getting harder and harder to find so when I stumbled on this I figured I would give it a try since it received such good reviews here and on other websites as well as featured in magazines as being one of the best. Lets start off with the packaging, I found the packaging pretty easy to use and a little bit different from most loose powder dry shampoos.  This is a spray type of sorts but isn't at the same time.  With this shampoo you basically shake it up and then squeeze the bottle  with the nozzle pointed at the roots of your hair, this allows puffs of the dry shampoo to be applied to your roots as opposed to most dry shampoos where you aim the pointed tip and kind of shake or squirt the bottle at your roots like you would with the Oscar Blandi or Alterna brands of loose powder dry shampoo.  I saw a lot of people kind of complain about this but I didn't  seem to have too much of an issue as I am used to working with the loose formulas.  On to the product it self, scent wise I didn't notice much of a scent at all and I am not super sensitive to fragrance but this did not seem to have an overly perfumey scent or any real noticeable scent to me so that might be a plus for those who are fragrance sensitive.  This product seemed to work fairly well  at absorbing the oils and giving me some volume in my hair as well but the one issue I had with it is that to me this doesn't seem like a actual straight out dry shampoo but more along the lines of a volumizing powder/dry shampoo.  If anyone has ever tried a volumizing powder before you know how they sort of make your hair, they tend to give it what you can call texture (from the silica) which can make it almost a little hard to brush thru since its goal is to sort of matte your hair and help with teasing of your hair to get that volume & lift.  So with this I had to be careful not to use too much otherwise it felt like it matted my hair and I had a hard time getting a brush thru it and styling with hot tools, other then that this was a pretty decent product but I still liked my Oscar Blandi Loose Dry Shampoo better.  One tip with this is that I found you really don't need a lot and once its applied to your roots massage thoroughly thru your scalp and what i like to do is also flip my head over and shake it a little as well. Then wait about 5 mins for it to absorbs all your oils and then brush thru.  I would purchase this shampoo again , however Oscar Blandi is my still number one go to  but this might be my replacement if they stop making the loose Oscar Blandi formula.",1
I have thick curly blonde hair and I expected this product to work like dry shampoo. When I used this product my hair became stiff and looked very greasy! Disappointed with my purchase.,0
Something was wrong with it. The color was darker and it had a rancid smell. Very disappointed,0
"I love the product but the tube is ridiculous and doesn't work very well to dispense the liquid.  This company seems to have a problem with packaging - I also bought a smaller tube with a wand and it broke immediately. Good product but until they figure out the packaging, I won't be buying any more.",0
Stylist used on me because I have thin fine hair. Helps give volume. Don't use it everyday but good to have on hand.,1
"I have used this product for many years to cover my balding spot. It covers very well and the color is perfectly matched. However, if you touch the surface accidentally where the product is, it will be removed unevenly. That leaves a strange looking area without theToppik. Additionally, if water hits your head as in rain drops, the area touched will just disappear and/or run in a green color. Yes green, even though the base color is dark brown?
I wonder if some sealer could be added as hair spray doesn't protect the area from these acts.",1
A complete scam.,0
A very good retinol lotion. Less irritating than other retinol preparations I have used,1
Really useful for baby,1
"It is fine, but not worth the price.",0
Works well,1
This product compared to when I purchase it at Ulta in their physical store was super watered down and I had to use three time what I normally use. I would not buy this product again.,0
Brilliantly orangey coral color! it was perfect for summer :),1
It was very very light in color,0
Good for people like me who has sensitive skin especially on the face. Keeps my face free from harmful sunrays. :D,1
Great,1
This stuff is great. I feel it's too expensive however. Probably would sell more at a lower price,1
"My skin is extremely dry in the winter and I use a prescription barrier, EpiCeram.  Insurance doesn't cover it and it's nearly $50...for less than that this hydrating cream (more like a gel consistency) does the trick!",1
I returned it. It didn't curl my recently permed hair any faster than my old Revlon. And the lack of a safe place to hold on to the end of the iron was a deal breaker.,0
"I have a very serious condition that makes me allergic to the sun. I take an expensive medication called Esbriet. It slows down the progression of a lung condition called IPF idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. There is no cure , but the Esbriet works wonders. I can't spend any time in the sun, or I get a terrible rash. I have tried a number of sunscreens , but this one works better than all others. Thanks to Consumer Reports for this blessing. It has changed my quality of life !!!",1
Was missing add-ons for the large clipper head.,0
"LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Its my new HOLY GRAIL. Makes your face feel like a baby's skin.. SUPER SOFT refreshed. I used it on my hubby too -- he loved it. I used it on my face, neck, boobies, down to my belly button area. I'm ordering more!",1
Doesnt leave the face feeling greasy.  Cant even tell its on my face.,1
"I had never used ORIBE products previously, but knew the name and wanted to try it out.  It is a very thick conditioner, and a little goes a long way.  It smells absolutely amazing, with the scent probably being my favorite part of it.  It rinses out easily, leaving my hair soft and shiny, but not greasy or weighed down.  I'm not sure how fifty dollar conditioner is supposed to work, as this is my first foray into this price-point, but I would imagine it should do all the things a drugstore brand does, plus make you feel like you are doing something luxurious.  ORIBE's Intense Conditioner easily checks all those boxes, and has luxury in spades.",1
Worth to buy,1
If you're new to DE shaving try a variety of blades.  These are alright for a beginner who is afraid of slicing their face up but after the first few shaves you can tell the are middle of the road blades and the amazon price is a bit steep compared to what you can find on shaving supply websites.  Each face and safety razor will have it's own blade.  2 star rating more because of the price (especially if you include shipping!).,0
Curls do not last nor do they create any waves. Waste of money.,0
Work great! Curls in short amount of time.,1
"I thought I was the only one who had palpitations after using for a few minutes. If you think about it, you use electricity to bring someone back, this is just a lot smaller amount.  Still scary. I really wish I'd research before I purchased. Not much out there on its safety or long term effects.",0
"I've reviewed almost a dozen ""Dark Eye Circle"" products on Amazon. I've had blue-ish circles for many years and probably more noticeable in the past 10. I have very translucent skin, so the pigment shows up pretty well. In my case, it's all genentic. So, I decided to try this and see what happened.
I tested this for 3 weeks, following the directions of applying 2 times daily. This is a very nice cream, no scent and goes on cool because of the applicator. It did reduce the puffiness around my eyes. It did NOT change the color of the circles. During the day, it does act as a bit of a cover, although I still use Benefit's ""Boing"" to also conceal. The cream makes the Boing a bit smoother so it doesn't settle in the small wrinkles, giving me a more even look.
I wish it did take away the bluish tint but alas, it did not.. I liked but did not love this product and for the price, I'm not sure I'd buy it regularly.",1
"I use Jane Irdale products and love them, I work for a Dermatology office and we used to sell this product. I ordered the eye liner on line and I believe it had been used, usually this product lasts a long time but I only got 10 to 12 applications out of it.",0
"i bought this product before from amazon & it was AWESOME.
i just ordered another one since mine was about to finish. & to my surprise its so different than the first one. its so GREASY like.
& its weighing the hair down like u just put baby oil on it. Disappointed as i really liked the first one.
maybe this was a defective one. but definitely not the agadir argan oil!!",0
I am a R.N. working in a Medical Spa ansi sell this stuff all day long. It will peel you with just a small amount. You have to be careful not to get it too close to your eyes due to all of the peeling. I have slathered this all over my face on several occasions and nothing has happened. Fake.,0
"Buy it! Buy it now!

Seriously, buy it.  I've had that ONE spot for as long as I can remember that would get irritated every time I shaved.  I've tried every incarnation of Gilette, Shick, electric, and Bob's discount razor.  Approached it at every angle imaginable, and some that weren't.  I've still got a system of pulleys in the bathroom and two trapeze artists on retainer through 2013; who knew they had a 2 year contract... But I digress. No bad spot anymore so buy this, shave smooth, be happy.",1
Proraso enough said.,1
"I received the RevitaLash Advanced today and was disappointed to find the product's cellophane covering had been removed and replaced with a badly-fitting plastic bag sealed with scotch tape.  Since the cellophane had been removed, I am returning it.  There is no expiration date on the box.  Possibly it was on the original cellophane?  I don't want a product that appears to have been opened or old.  The RevitaLash should have been wrapped in it's original packaging.",0
I have been using this for about 6 months to prevent my hair from further thinning and in hopes of maybe a bit fuller.  I use as directed 3/4 times a week....  I have not noticed any difference.  My hair still seems to be thinning and no new growth apparent.  Fortunately I bought this Hairmax 12 for $300 new prior to it going on Dr Oz which upped the cost over $100.  My sister is using it also but with additional shampoo products and supplements.  I believe the shampoo and supplements are what's given her better results.,0
"Item arrived with the cap flipped open and at least one use worth leaked out into the bag it was wrapped in. First use stained my hands purple. Hope my hair isn't purple when it dries. Sorry, but a rating of two is all I can do at this point based on the arrival condition and stained hands.",0
"Arrived with burned styling product on the plates, thus is obviously used. Even worse, it doesn't even turn on.",0
I love the color Like Linen but it's super runny. I've put on four coats and it still isn't a solid color on my nails..,0
"I love wearing makeup and are always trying new products in the market. I had tried other cream eyeshadows before and they seemed to disappear in a just a few hours. I had hoped that the marketplace had a longer lasting eyeshadow and I thought that with the high price that this might be it. I was completely disappointed in that the eyeshadow lasted less than a couple of hours. The color was beautiful and if you are only going out for a very short time you might want to consider this eyeshadow although the price is way too high.

I cannot recommend this product as it does not last and it is very expensive. The only thing was that the color was very pretty.",0
doesn't work.,0
It does not feel like it is doing anything! I have tried using it and it feels like it does not penetrate my skin.,0
"Really like this shampoo, it has the mint/tea tree scent and feel but unlike many other mint shampoos it doesn't make your head feel like you've been dunked into a bucket of Listerine and are on fire! It's very subtle and mild. It is a bit drying as most shampoos with sulfates are so I'd recommend using it with conditioner.",1
A  very good product and can be useful to maintain beautiful and health skin.,1
Same as the one I buy in the store I love the coverage and how it doesn't cause me to breakout.,1
Bought as a gift. The pump part is missing! Hoping the company will replace or just get me a pump top for it!,0
Been using this for a long time...have some hair loss and thinning in crown of head...this works for me. Give it a try,1
"The best stuff ever!!! It's perfect for dry hair, but if you don't have dry hair, all you need is a little. I LOVE this product.",1
I expected it to be softer on my skin. I do not recommend it .,0
"I love the product.  In fact, they Proraso makes the cream they sell at Bath and Body Works.  I think it's called the CO Bigalow line.  Anyways, this cream lathers great with a brush in a bowl.  It smells great.  I think it works great.  The ONLY reason I won't give it 5 starts is because of the packaging.  The caps on these metal tubes is a soft plastic and breaks EVERY TIME.  That means you can't travel with this.  I wish they used a cheaper tube and a better cap, that way I didn't need to buy ""normal"" shaving cream/foam/gel for when I travel.",1
"I suffer from very oily skin and cystic acne. Since using the product my skin has become slightly less oily, the occurrence of ""zits"" on my face has dramatically decreased, and over the course of a few weeks the scars have slightly faded, however the cystic blemishes have not been affected, and neither have blackheads. The product feels lovely on my face and body and leaves it feeling very clean and soft (I spray my face, wipe it off with a tissue, spray again and let it dry).

The bottle is very high quality, as is the sprayer, and it disperses the product evenly every time. I was genuinely surprised by how fine the mist is.

Overall, this is a very high quality product, but my results were not as miraculous as others have experienced.",1
"Heard some good review on this toothpaste, however to me, it just a regular toothpaste, I was looking for what it call the ""strong mint"" and ""freshness"" after I brush my teeth, it doesn't make me feel like it work that way, doesn't worth this price to me, definitely didn't impress me at all. I won't buy it again.",0
This is summer and happiness bottled It is so fresh and lemony and lifts my mood every single time I apply. Only issue is the scent does not last very long on me so I filled a rollerball with some to carry with me to apply throughout the day.,1
"This is the second time I've tried this cream on my upper, inside arms and I've been using it for two months.  I can't say I see any improvement but I will continue using it until it's gone.",0
"For the price I am disappointed. I prefer my $20 straightener.  With the long part of this one it is hard for me to use this to assist with curling my hair. Also, it doesn't seem to meet in the middle to straighten.",0
This is much darker than it looks. Dark brown not taupe,0
This was a gift for my mom since one she has had for years died on her. This hair dryer is great it dries her hair really fast and it is light to travel with. I love the Nano product they are great. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a good hair dryer this is by far the best one I have ever purchased.,1
"My most favorite hair dryer ever purchased! It was recommended to me buy a couple hair dressers. It has a strong motor and is able to dry my very long, thick hair in about ten minutes. It usually takes double that time when using a different hair dryer. I always recommend this to people looking for a durable, high quality hair dryer.",1
"Not the original Obagi product, will not do its job help exfoliate.  Will not buy Obagi products from amazon anymore.",0
Broke after a month and a half - 30 day return policy! Wont buy again,0
Good,1
"have it for 3 weeks and used 3 times.. the blower is not working. No manual, no help.. ask the compnay.
Need $12 for repair service..  do not buy the lower even it is $10.",0
This product is what I was expecting.,1
"The container was dirty and had no cellophane around it. It had already been primed, so I had no way of knowing whether someone else had used it. Also, the item was short dated: 9/2015 New products that I had received from other vendors had a dating of 2018.",0
I didn't like this product at ALL.  It clumped when I put it on.  I will never buy it again.,0
Seems very watered down...,0
Originally I thought I had bought my last lash curler but once I tried it I didn't think it worked very well.  It took too long to curl the lashes and it didn't do a good job.  I ended up using my squeeze one (not sure what it's called!) anyway.  Not a fan of the lash curler but I will continue to buy their mascara!  That stuff is awesome!,0
I tried this product and for me it dried my  lips and didn't really last for very long. I thought a lip stain should last longer.,0
I am a huge Noodle In Boo fan and LOVE this lotion but very disappointed and disgusted at how the bottle I ordered arrived at my house. The bottle itself was filthy...dusty and actual dirt on it. It was also dented and scraped in several places. It looked like it was thrown out of a moving car. And finally the seal inside was broken. Just nasty.,0
"I recently ordered this perfume because I tried it on at Sephora and fell in love! This is a very sexy perfume and it lingers long after you put it on. I received so many compliments from that one sample spritz that I had to buy it. The scent is light, not soapy and not overpoweringly floral. It just smells like a very delicate bouquet that leaves you wanting more.",1
"Love Shellac, but his color is too pea green for me",1
"This jar is larger than I was expecting, at 13.2 ounces. The red jar is plastic, while the lid has a brushed copper look (it's not copper, just looks like it). The jar was sealed with foil underneath the lid. The smell is divine! I really like it. Reminds me of something Aveda might produce, very earthy and natural. It says it's sweet orange and cedar wood, but it does not have a strong citrus smell (which is good, as that can end up smelling like cleaning products) but the two scents play so nicely together.

Upon use the product is very gentle, while also a great exfoliant. The rich oils leave the skin feeling very moisturized and dewy. Overall, this product has a very luxurious, high-end feel with an amazing scent. It would make a great addition to any spa, bath routine, or gift!",1
I have been using it for two weeks but don't notice any significant improvement of my face. I will keep using it since I paid all the money but I am not expecting any miracle.,0
This product does not remove completely my foundation make up without several applications.,0
I purchased smaller bottles of this shampoo and conditioner from my hairstylist previously.  I absolutely love it.  Skews my hair so shiny and healthy.  Smells great also.,0
"who thinks this is a silly product?  I ordered this through vine, because for one thing  it didn't cost me anything and yes, I was curious enough.  But honestly, I didn't feel (or look) any more radiant, toned or hydrated. The only things I felt were silly for spritzing my face and neck with this slightly sticky feeling, citrus smelling water and grateful that I didn't spend any money on it.

Would I recommend?  NO.",0
Not sure if I can like it or not since the cap was broken and sprayed on my hands and not my hair .,0
"JI's products are cruelty-free and this is the main reason I've bought them, though to be quite frank, in this case, I feel that the primer does little to nothing to make makeup last longer. I will not purchase it again.",0
After 3 weeks of use some pimples appeared. So I am not using as much I was..,0
"At the advice of my hairdresser I bought 2 bottles of this shampoo and conditioner.  Since I am out of both bottles, I will not be buying more.  I did not notice a difference in hair color lasting from any other shampoo I have used for color treated hair.  I did notice my hair was shiny but also has a card board feeling to it.  When I straighten my hair it does not straighten as nicely when I used Redken or Pureology.  This product has made my hair ""wild"" and normally I get so many compliments on my hair--thanks to my Vidal Sassoon trainer hairdresser but since using this shampoo my hair is not the same.  Obviously, everyone has different hair and it wasn't a good fit for me.",0
"Not a fan of this product! I LOVE EltaMD's UV Clear SPF46 and expected this product to live up to that, but is a miss for me.

As someone with acne-prone, oily skin I love that EltaMD's products are geared toward that skin type. However instead of being light and hydrating, I find that this moisturizer is super siliconey feeling and just sits on top of the skin (leaving a tacky shine that doesn't rub in).

I've had far better results with Neutrogena Water Gel/Clinique DDMG type of products.",0
"The anti-acne ingredient in Vichy Normaderm Beautifying lotion is 1.5% salicylic acid. I generally use a product with 2% concentration, so I didn't expect this lotion to be so drying. My skin began flaking and peeling after one use - and that's not all that unusual with a new anti-acne lotion, but even spacing out applications, after more than a week it's not any better. I'm going back to my higher concentration, but somehow gentler, regular product.",0
"I used this account (my boyfriend's) to order this curling iron. And I didn't have it for very long, but it already doesnt get as hot as it used to. It also doesn't curl my hair at all.",0
Fake product,0
"Honestly, I wasn't expecting to like this. I'm really fair and any sort of pigment (like post-acne marks) shows up vividly on my skin, and sticks around for a long time. This isn't opaque enough to cover all of my marks but it does help. I'd say it has more coverage than a tinted moisturizer but less coverage than a foundation. It's really light weight and matte. I use this as a makeup base and then stipple my usual foundation (I use Estee Lauder because most of their makeup is non-acnegenic) over it. This is awesome because it helps heal any acne I have while preventing more, and I use less makeup.

The one thing I really don't like about it is the fact that it oxidizes orange the second it dries. This is another reason I put my usual makeup over it because otherwise I'd look like an oompa loompa. You can definitely smell the sulfur in it but it's not strong enough to be off-putting. Over all, great product.",1
Best curling iron I have used-- wouldn't go back to any other! I like that the tip is covered so less chance of burning myself and the cord is super long.,1
"The ingredients changed. This wash kept my skin very clear and it even helped with some post acne marks. Now that they've changed the formula my skin does NOT respond well to it. I started getting breakouts and a bumpy rash. Why oh why did you have to mess with a good thing! :(

I've inserted 2 pictures showing the differences. The one with less ingredients worked wonders on my skin.",0
I have no idea how this is supposed to work. I've tried it a number of different ways. It also smells terrible.,0
"Seriously a rip off/joke. $50 for a container 3/4 full. Before this brand became super popular, they'd fill up the container. Time for a different brand.",0
"Terrible, runny! Clear water kept spilling our, like the product was not mixed inside the tube. I returned it.",0
Great seems to be working little by little,1
"I love La Roche-Possay. It is a French pharmaceutical brand. Their products are sold only in pharmacies in Europe. They do not irritate your skin. Do not have any smell. This very serum is ok, but my skin is tough as well, so I am not the best example. But the brand itself is great. Pharmaceutical brands are more effective than cosmetic ones.",1
The brush is very small (almost ridiculously small) and it wasn't any better than a regular top coat. I usually love OPI products but this one wasn't my favorite.,0
Works great. I have long tangled hair. Smooths it out.  Only downside is cost.,1
The product description says its formulated with hydroquinone the ingredients do not list it.,0
Very nice. Love the color.,1
"This color is sheer. 2 coats provides barely any coverage, more like it tints your nails lime green like they are stained. I tried it on and ended up covering it with another color to complete my manicure. Really bad color, wish I never bought, will never wear.",0
"Just turned 50, look early 40s. I was surprised that this did provide immediate results - they're subtle but noticeable. My skin looked a bit brighter, my jaw line a bit firmer, and my eyebrow area a bit more taught.  The feeling is a bit tingly, definitely felt a bit of a charge, but not painful. I will continue to update as I see results and will add a star if its warranted.",1
I found this product to leave my hair very greasy feeling,0
Grreat,1
I have fine hair that gathers lots of static in the fall and winter. This product actually made it WORSE. In my opinion it has no anti-static properties at all. Waste of money and it is not returnable.,0
"Was not very pleased  with this. Can't tell it's steaming  cause of the liquid  or because  it's heating up on hair,button to turn on steam is in an akward place and cant tell if you turned it on or off..didn't  get as hot as I thought  to straighten  out my hair.. I have curly hair and after  I was done which took longer than I usually  do because you have to wait for it to reheat my hair  was left kinda frizzy.",0
Cheaper than in the stores and smells great on me!  I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.,1
"Clearly fake, but the fragrance is very very similar, and it does last long enough.",1
"Honestly, this stuff smells amazing and if this were a perfume I'd be repurchasing it. However, this did nothing for my hair other than make it smell nice. It does take out some oil so if you have oily hair that maybe be a plus, but I have dry hair and this did almost nothing as far as volume goes. I could name 5 products that all give better lasting texture than this with a much smaller price tag!",0
"Smell is very strong... waste of money, cannot use",0
"It works good as far as oil control and I like the smell. My hair is dark brown, however, and I can not use it because it shows up white. I'm very disappointed in this product for that reason alone.",0
broked really fast dint work the Silk and flash a go was working perfectly until 5000 flashes ran out and i had to buy a new flash and go cartrigde  sadly this one dosent work i would not recomend it.,0
"I had originally written a glowing review about this product a while back. I have used this product for a very, very long time. However I just opened my last bottle. An this is not the original version. This is liquid, has a rancid smell to it. Either it isn't the original product or l'Occitane has cheapen their product (i.e. 4 Reines pearlescent cream and the shower gel) that it does not pay to pay this price for the lack of quality.",0
Very nice SPF for the face with a hint of cover.,1
love this!,1
Im use to Essie polishes being of better quality. I had to put on 3 coats to get an accurate color pay off.,0
"I bought this product to help clean my hair in between washings.  I have dark hair and had an ombre tint on the bottom and was hoping to extend the life of my color.  My hair tends to be naturally thick and oily.  The dry shampoo was extremely difficult to apply myself.  You are supposed to apply it to the roots of your hair, but even using a mirror it was hard to see just how much product was coming out and where.  Ultimately, I was left with a ton of powder on my scalp, but it was hard to work through the rest of my hair.  It made my hair look dusty on top and still dirty and oily on the bottom.  It also has a very strong smell - like lemon mixed with bleach - which was not very refreshing.  As others have noted, it smelled more like cleaning product than cleansing beauty product.  Definitely would not recommend.",0
We had a bottle before that worked great. The new bottle does not work well at all. I'm not sure if they are fake or a bad batch. I would buy it elsewhere!,0
Not as good as original head.,0
I really like the Julep face primer. It feels a little thick while applying but that feeling goes away quickly. My face feels smooth and for almost 60 looks really good. I use this after applying moisturizer and under a light application of liquid make-up. I have used this several days now and it did seem to burn one day when I put it on after working outside in the sun. Only that day did I notice any irritation at all and I do have sensitive skin.,1
it is not the same strength as the clear one. do not recommend,0
"I thought I would splurge on this product since they sold it at my work, which was at a resort. I got it and it was not great and made my skin oily. J am in my early twentys and don't need anything to add oil to my skin. This is not worth the splurge. I returned this product.",0
"I highly recommend this beauty water! It's one of my favorite products and I've gone through a few bottles already. It's multi function! It cleans, tones, and exfoliates! I've definitely felt the difference in my skin after using this product. I've recommended it to many friends and they have all loved it so far. It leaves your skin feeling clean and hydrated before you start your full facial routine!",1
This product isn't really worth it. Save your money and only buy the powder. The powder will cover all.,0
"This lotion is my daughter's favorite.  It's not easy to find as it isn't a new or current scent.  I'm glad I could find it at this site.  She is very happy and therefore, so am I.",1
the push down spray button keeps jamming and I don't get a steady mist.  Smells good but definitely wouldn't buy again - not worth the money,0
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING PRODUCT. HAVE USED IT EVERYDAY FOR 3 YEARS. Nobody can tell the difference. *wink wink*,1
It seemed ok under eyes. But dried out one of my eye lids to the point of painful peeling. Maybe allergic? Only one eyelid reacted this way.,0
It is the perfect oil for dry skin.,1
I have always gotten a great shave from this in combination with Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor and  some platinum blades.,1
Haven't tried the iron but it arrived clearly used. Returning it and buying somewhere elsse,0
"This curling iron stopped working after 4 months.
The one before this only lasted a year. What happened to quality manufacturing. I am waiting to see what the supplier says on this one.",0
This worked for over a year. Then one day on medium setting it literally singed my hair off. I had to cut my hair to get rid of the damage.,0
Love the product c: it rescued my hair! The shipping was great! It came the day after I ordered it. The only problem was that the bottle wasn't protected very well so half of the bottle leaked out :/ it was very disappointing :/,0
the spray doesn't work right,0
This did nothing for any of my dark spots.  I saw it recommended in a beauty magazine and thought I would give it a shot but it didn't work.,0
"This does nothing.  Doesn't absorb well so under my eyes looks greasy.  Lasts a long time, that's the only plus.",0
Awesome scent,1
Does wonders on the skin . Relieves redness and makes the skin soft and even,1
Makes my hair have static. Don't really like it.,0
I love this product. There is a difference when not used. Lasts several months.,1
Purchased this after receiving a sample and it has absolutely no perfume scent. Smells like concentrated alcohol. Beware of this merchant/manufacturer.,0
"Other users had mentioned that the pump does not work well.....  Well mine arrived and sure enough, does not work at all.
The cream is VERY thick, I don't think the pump assembly is not adequate for the cream.  I contacted the company direct by email
asking that I want another PUMP.  No response.  seems they don't answer the phone and chat never seems to be working.
I am very disappointed as I was expecting a high quality item and perhaps a bottle.
To be fair, I have to mention that the cream is nice.  Glide on so nice and don't have offensive sun screen smell.",0
Fine product,1
Works well for curly hair,1
"The scent is very nice but does not last long and almost fades away quickly. I wonder is it because I bought this from Amazon on a discount and is there a reason why it's discounted in first place!! Well, it came in a package that resembled original packaging so I doubt but the strength of scent fading away quick makes me suspicious.",1
After reading the reviews I really expected it  to clear up my skin more. It didn't. But it is very moisturizing and that is great for my skin.  But for the price I don't think I would get it again.,0
Perfect for me as I have long nails and like different colors that pop.,1
"This is the best base coat I have ever used. It is a must if you are using Julep nail color, but it works with other brands just great.",1
They are real narrow . If you have a wider foot you will have problems,0
This is a great product I have been using for over a year now. It has really helped with the fizziness and dryness of my hair. I always bought it at a beauty salon but I decided to give it a try buying it from a seller online. And now I can say I will never do it again. They changed the content or maybe added water to it because my hair is again out of control with my frizziness. Do not buy products from this seller!!,0
This is the only moisturizer my son can use and doesn't hurt.  It has been amazing.  His skin gets really dry and his hands will crack.  We can apply it over night and they are much better in the morning.  Best product we have used for his sensitive skin.,1
Horrible Application. When you use it it clumps up. Yuck!,0
satisfied with my purchase. There is no fall out when washing the brush. Used it to apply my loose powder for a smooth finish.,1
Expensive but good.  I wish they had larger containers.,1
Dries too quickly causing blade not to glide smoothly.,0
Worked great as an SPF protector using natural sunscreen. I liked that it was easy to blend in and my skin felt very soft and smooth after!,1
My wife did not like this product. It left her hair looking and feeling oily and thin.,0
"My husband could NOT line up the blades when tightening the blade. It always would stick the blade out in weird angles. He tried it, BAD idea.  USE GEL shaving cream to shave.",0
Very good!!,1
"It broke after one use,
I used this curling iron ONE TIME, and it did not work any more. It left my hair half done :(.
I tried contacting the seller Natural Born, but they do not have any kind of contact information.",0
"I read some reviews on other websites. I believe in this product. Has a masculine scent, mild, not over the top. What I read about it is it is really used before shaving your male genital regions. It makes your hairs softer and easier to cut, it reduces chances of getting nice and cuts. It works for me, I have ben using it for 1-2 years now. Alone is ok, but you should read up on how to shave down south. For example, others suggest great care, such as pouring clear rubbing alcohol over you blade, I personally like 2 blade razors, or one. Others suggest of course showering first, washing down below with your favorite soap, then apply this, then apply a lather which I do, but not the lather for your face, you do not want menthol or burning in your personal area, this company sells a lather which is nice, smooth, rich, soft scent masculine, and it worked well for me, then after the lather you can shave. Steps: Shower, wash good; dry up. So if too much hair, use an electric neck hair trimmer, then wash up again, then alcohol to your new razor, then use this great oil, use and apply a separate shave lotion for sensitive skin or this company's one, shave away. After it is done, there is another product from this company, and after shave, it does not sting, I love and use it, it helps soothe. I also then add some body powder talc free of course, I like Goldbond Co.'s powder. As far as this Shaveworks, I swear by it and and now a life time user.",1
Do not use if you have any type of oil issues.. I used 3 times in 3 weeks to test and as I expected it broke my face out bad I never have acne after all it is a serum but my entire face broke out Toner is awesome and smells great eye cream also is awesome I have cancelled any further orders my face burns itches and is covered in bumps this product may work for over dry skin but not normal skin like mine that is in between dry and oily,0
I'm getting good results with this styling cream. It gives my thin hair body as long as I'm careful to use a dime-size amount. Other reviewers say that using too much makes the hair sticky!,1
This product is not like other BaBylissPro Nano's that I have used. The plates don't touch and it does not straighten.,0
Color is too pink ! Not natural looking. Have to return it. But it is full coverage!,0
Disatisfied.,0
"This review is in the context of the product being used as a facial moisturizer.  I'm a guy, 40's, and my daily regimen is to wash my face with facial soap and warm water, shave with a safety razor (not cartridge-based), rinse with cold water, and apply lotion.  It should be noted that I usually apply Aveeno Daily Moisturizing lotion to my face (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001459IEE), and in my opinion, the Amazon reviews for Aveeno are accurate.

My first experience with Crabtree & Evelyn was at a Hilton.  Great scent, but, again I'm a guy, so while quite lovely, lavender and verbena are not typically what one would wear; your preferences may vary, and that's okay.  Although I would like to observe that when paired with Aqua di Gio, it makes for quite an interesting symphony of scents.

Moving along, I want to comment on the feel of this lotion.  As a moisturizer, regardless of scent, I feel like its primary duty is to, well, moisturize.  Make no mistake, the lotion goes on smoothly and lacks any greasy consistency.  Yet after about ten to fifteen minutes, my face starts to feel a little tight; particularly around the eyes and forehead.  Not what I wan in a lotion.  It is bearable; I've certainly had worst, and its nowhere as intense as, say, using a bar of body soap on my face (yikes!).  However, I have to admit that my Aveeno still rules my bathroom counter in terms of keeping my face feeling smooth and comfortable.

 So I think that for now, I shall continue to use Aveeno, but MAYBE look forward to when Aveeno releases a ""lavender and verbena"" scent to go along with my AdG! :)  I would not hesitate to use this lotion at a Hilton again, though, and it is still, in my opinion, a good lotion; just not the best for my face.  Your experience might be different.  Thanks for reading!",1
This totally works. I have fine hair and if I spray it on when wet and blow dry my hair definitely feels thicker and has more body that lasts until the next wash. A good product. Smells like a light men's cologne when wet but the smell fades.,1
VERY HAPPY WITH IT,1
"First, I have been paying WAY too much at my salon for this stuff!  (Sorry local businesses, but your mark-ups are too high) The product itself is great.  It smells nice, it leaves my hair soft instead of greasy or weird, and doesn't build up like some other oil sprays can.  This is a high quality product.",1
"This is a great product, but this tiny tube arrived less than half full. I barely had one application in the tube.",0
"This is the best curler on the market!  Forget purchasing any other eye-lash curler, as this one is the ONLY one that will curl, and keep your eyelashes curled all day!
Save your money, and forgo any other eye-lash curlers out there that imitate this one- - -they are cheap imitations!  Japonesque uses a stronger plastic that will give you months of proper curling - - - no wimpy curl here!  (I usually will get a year's worth of curling from this!)",1
"I was a little hessitant thinking that this producduct would work after seeing its advertisement.  After the product was given 2 thumbs up from ""Men's Health"", I decided to try it.  The product does an effective job at controling that ""shine"" factor that sometimes happens throughout the day.",1
"This is the best product for curly hair ever made! I love it. This product with the intense curl cream makes my hair so soft, it is unbelievable! No more frizz!",1
Like this product very refreshing,1
I LOVE IT . MY GRANDKIDS LOVE IT . NEED I SAY MORE.,1
"Ordered this product as a gift, Amazon through all 4 tubes in a box with a very heavy item and no protection, all tubes were out of their boxes when received and the boxes damaged.",0
"After having read another customers review, maybe I got a counterfeit myself from another vendor.  This gel was a ripoff.  I did nothing for my hair.  It did not keep it down, did not straighten it at all, and flaked.  I have tried other gels way cheaper that worked better than this.  Will not repurchase.",0
"Not something I would recommend.  It is VERY small.  Doesn't heat up very well and takes at least 5-7 strokes just to get my wavy hair to straighten.  Also, not good if you have a lot of hair or thick.  I would return if I didn't hold onto it for so long.  Waste of $30...",0
"I love biolage for color treated hair but I wanted to change up products because I feel like my hair gets used to the same thing after a while. So I tried this product because it said it's good for all hair types. After using it the first time I blow dried my hair and noticed it was very moisturized and smooth. But by the middle of the day my hair looked like it hadn't been washed in 2 days, especially my bangs. So I'm thinking this shampoo is more for dry hair.",0
The pink part was like 1/3 the bottle Im not sure if thats normal but 1 tip dip for 7 day cut that on half doesnt seem like it will last long.,0
Product came with fake sticker label on it.,0
I wanted vinyl and go Shellac not interested and was not allowed to return it.  Shame on you!!!!!,0
The shampoo in the 8oz bottles comes out more like the consistency of toothpaste. The shampoo in the gallon bottle comes out like water. I cant say for a fact that they water it down but I don't see any other explanation.,0
"Seriously love this concealer. For me, it matches my skin tone so perfectly I have trouble seeing it! Goes on breath smooth and doesn't end up dry or Casey at the end of the day. Most days I just use this under my eyes and on a couple of other places and no foundation. The sponge applicator that comes with it is pretty worthless, but I just use disposable makeup sponges and it works very well.",1
"This hairdryer blew up in my hand after a year or so. Sparks flew out of the end. Scary, right? Buy at your own risk.",0
This product is amazing.,1
"DO NO BUY THIS. They have changed the formula and amazon did not reflect it on the product page. This new formula RUINED my face. I ended up with cystic acne and very angry skin. Mario Badescu, BRING BACK the original formula! This thing is now garbage, DO NOT BUY.",0
Don't like how it comes out the can,0
i have given this to friends.  works on waterproof mascara.... great product.  No downside.,1
"I bought this accidentally thinking it was the replenishing mist and didn't realize until 2 days later. The mist I spray very liberally in my hair so that's what I did when using this product. I knew something was amiss because my hair felt very crunchy although it didn't look it.  All day at work people commented on how voluminous and lovely my hair looked. Now, I have naturally curly hair that is poofy and unruly. I love it but I usually don't get compliments on it. I think the key with this product is to use sparingly or perhaps on wet hair. Either way I will keep it because it does have a nice effect.",1
"this is the only thing that has worked for me, it dries your pimples over night",1
I've  used this cream for well over 6 weeks i don't see any difference,0
"Unlike most similar products, the packaging for this says ""reduces wrinkles and firms skin,"" rather than ""reduces the APPEARANCE of..."" and ""SEEMS to..."" so I was hopeful that it might, in fact, work. And it does. Sort of :) I think it does as much as you can reasonably expect--it infuses your skin with moisture, so teeny-tiny lines near the corners of my eyes are more ""filled out"" and you don't really notice them at all. The deeper ones on my forehead, however, look the same way they always have. So this *does* make a slight difference, and that's probably as much as one can ever expect from a product (vs. cosmetic procedure).

One quick random note - it says to apply ""two drops,"" but a single pump probably equates to about 20 drops, and trying to get ""1/10th of a pump"" is a bit silly/impossible. I do 1/2 pump when I remember and a full pump when I forget, and it's probably a bit more than I need, but doesn't really hurt (apart from making me go through the product more quickly).",1
"Quick delivery, great price, awesome product-would buy from again! Love the color, easy to do touch-ups if it gets chipped, and matches almost anything!",1
Has anyone looked at the ingredients in this stuff? This is not something you want on your face. Also very low quality and it looks like it.,0
"Great aroma, but a bit strong",1
I use this 3-4 weeks after having my hair colored because the roots are beginning to show.  It is easy to apply and covers the roots nicely. The roots stay colored until I shampoo my hair and then I need to reapply.,1
gave me migraines,0
Love the fragrance. Hard to find the item sold separately in stores. Always have to by sets. Reasonably priced item.,1
I don't think this is a real elchim. It does NOT get hot. So so so mad and disappointed,0
Great for Dry Colorado weather. I love it.,1
Ahhhhhhh....I LOVE this stuff on my husband. Smells soooo good. My husband has tried different brands with same sandalwood scent because they were cheaper...DID NOT smell as nice as this brand. Worth the price ladies and gents. Guys- your ladies will love this on you!!,1
This item is advertised as having a pump lid and this has a regular lid - I feel cheated.,0
I don't see results,0
"Really works. Expensive, but works.",1
Better than expected. I now use it once a week instead of going to get my airbrush tan.,1
"We call these ""magic hairbrushes""
They last forever and somehow are just different from the copycats.  My two daughters and I won't use anything else",1
"I was disappointed in the amount that it held. It covered well and was easy to use, but I wish it had lasted longer.",0
This is a great strengthener! It works on my hair which is thin and my daughters hair and she has pretty thick hair! It also curls very well too! Very impressed!,1
"After reading the rave reviews on this I thought great!  Then I started using it and was not pleased at all.  It chips off after barely a day (I can wear most polishes for at least four days without chipping), and it has done something weird to my nails in that they seem really dry and brittle since using.  I don't know if it is just something to do with my particular chemistry not being compatible, or what.  I was very unhappy and would not repurchase, ever.",0
Loaded with parabens. Why oh why?,0
This hair straightener heats up so quickly. It makes my hair super straight and it helps seal out the frizz!,1
"As for some reason my figures have started swelling when I painted my nails...
I ordered this product. No more problems... totally happy!",1
I like it very much.,1
"What in the world did they add to this product?  Pure Gold?  After years of us, it is impossible for me to continuing buying this now-overpriced product.  The increase in price is nothing but GREED and a lot of it.  Give us back the simple white 4oz bottle at a decent price, please.",0
"Excellent Product...use it almost daily...You can see the results in a couple of weeks...I have a full head of hair
Richard",1
Just what I wanted for less money than stores,1
"Okay disregard bad reviews.  If you've never used a professional flat iron you are in for something different and of course depending on your hair type you need to have the right setting.  I'm guessing if you've burned your hair off that is a user issue.  This iron does get extremely hot and literally starts heating the minute it's turned on.  Definitely hits the 450 mark, if set there, within the 30 seconds.  So yes of course you have to be careful, don't be dumb.

I have very thick long corse hair.  I do use the 450 setting and I run this through my hair once and it's stick straight.  No waves, no going back over it, I love it!!  I also love that I can wash my hair, dry it and once I straighten it with this iron and it STAYS that way.  I've noticed in the past when I do that I usually have to go back over my hair a little later due to moisture I guess.

Got stuck out in the rain for a second the other day, hair stayed straight and gorgeous!  No frizzing up.  Been using this for exactly two weeks and it's saved me tons of time.  I also notice my hair looking a lot healthier and finer and it's so so soft :)

I had a Paul Mitchell smoothing iron years ago that did hold in there strong for 3+ years and I loved it.  It finally saw it's last day when the swivel cord went bad but I remember the quality.  If you've had that iron or have it now, you know how great that one is and this one is even better.  Surprisingly!!

I've owned the smoothing Paul Mitchell iron (my 2nd fave) and I've owned two Solia Irons since.......this one leaps and bounds is the winner!  Worth every penney.",1
"Loved the idea, but I never saw much difference if any. I would not recommend this product and will not be buying it again.",0
"Does nothing, too heavy, didn't like it, not for my skin type, who knows, No, i don't recommend this cream. I rather leave it alone after the use of pixie laser pen.",0
I do my shellac nails at home and have had great success until I tried this color.  I can not get this color to last more than a few days before it chips.  It also looks streaky after 2 coats.  I didn't do a third coat as some other reviewers have done.  I even tried curing this color longer than I have had to cure other colors.  I have tried three times and will now give up with this color.  Maybe I just got a bad bottle of polish.  I'm not sure and it is a shame because the color is very pretty.,0
Great job keeping my oilyness under control.,1
"Suface Bliss is supposed to smooth your hair.  It only smooths mine for a few minutes and I have to keep using it for any result.  Its humid where I live, and I am still loking for a product that can really combat frizzy hair.  This works but only for a short  time.",0
"Applying takes a little practice as the formula is heavily pigmented.
I use a moisturiser and primer even thought this is a BB cream.
SPF and is not tested on animals",1
Not as pretty as I had hoped.,0
I have been using this product since May 2015 & have really liked the results I have gotten.,1
The bottle design makes it difficult to spray. The pump sometimes sticks. The silver cap is like a paper weight really heavy tips bottle over easily once you've reached about half use. Love the fragrance though.,1
Beautiful color!!,1
Great item.,1
Love the way my skin feels with this toner. I follow it up with Vichy moisturizer. But you will love the smell.,1
This is a really great anti-humidity spray!,1
did' not work well for me.,0
"My favorite device of this type. ( I also have an emjoi). The device is easy to hold and pretty lightweight.  I like that it comes with rollers of 2 different degrees of coarseness. I cannot yet speak to how fast the rollers wear out, but I have used mine 2-3 times a week for a month and they are noticeably worn yet. There is a brush Included for cleaning, but you can pop the whole roller cartridge off and rinse it  under water for extra cleanliness. Batteries are included which is a nice surprise. Works so well, be sure to use it over a towel or paper or else you'll have foot callus dust all over.",1
"I use Wen pretty regularly and I could not believe the price I got on these.  Well, while it is acceptable conditioner I am not convinced it is a genuine Wen product.",0
"I have burned several Lafco candles, and this is the only one I do not like. The aroma can only be smelled when standing directly over the candle, and a strange gunk of fiber clusters around the wick. I have only burned about a quarter of the wax, but I am seriously considering cutting out the wax to use the container (and the container isn't even pretty).",0
This mascara does not go on well at all.  I can barely tell it's on once applied.  I would not recommend this product and I will not be ordering it again.,0
"A decent eye cream, probably wouldn't buy again there are cheaper products that work just as good",1
its so gooey and sticky!  I cant use it!,0
"This is not a shower oil. It is a shower gel.  It is a nice shower gel but nonetheless it is not an OIL as it claims on label.
It is also a glass bottle- which is weird to have in the shower.",0
Not as sturdy as we would have expected.,0
"Loved the idea, but I never saw much difference if any. I would not recommend this product and will not be buying it again.",0
Not really what I suspected not good for fine hair,0
"Personally Love this Product!!! I have used several shampoo's in the past, this is truly worth it's weight in gold!! The shampoo and conditioner are GREAT!!! Always keep a backup supply on hand!! Love the Minty fragrance and the tingle on the scalp of the Conditioner!!",1
"My salon carries this product and my stylist insisted that it was perfect for my hair. I have medium length, fairly straight, fine hair, but a lot of hair at the same time, so finding products that work with my hair is actually really difficult. Because of the fineness, I needs something that helps with volume, but at the same time, it has to be gentle so that it doesn't strip my hair of moisture. This product is super gentle and it's great for color treated hair, it really helps to reduce fading, but it is way to heavy for my hair. I'm not surprised that the rave reviews are coming from people with thick, curly hair, it totally makes sense that this would work for them. I use a pea sized amount as you don't need to use a lot to clean the hair, but somehow it always feels like I dumped a ton of conditioner on the crown of my head without rinsing when I get out of the shower. I absolutely love the conditioner that goes with this shampoo, it is truly great on it's own, but I can only condition the very ends of my hair or else I wind up looking like I haven't conditioned in days. I'm not sure why my stylist thinks this is the right shampoo for me, but I highly caution people with fine or medium to light weight hair to go a different route. If you have thick hair and want a luxurious shampoo that won't strip your color, give this a try, but use a very small amount until you find the right amount for your hair.",0
"It never soaked in all the way and left my skin feeling sticky. After a few days of use, I started to feel incredibly itchy. The sun protection seemed okay.",0
Was initially skeptical of the fragrance due to the peppercorn. But to be honest it gives you a very manly smell without being overwhelming. My girlfriend loves it!,1
"Easy to follow the instructions and when you do, this setting powder works well. I don't use a heavy amount of make-up. I use concealer, liquid foundation, blush, brow pencil and mascara. Occasionally I will use eye lid color and lipstick. I don't like my make-up to feel heavy but I want to forget I'm wearing it. This powered gives that light feel of not being there but still helps keep the make-up I do wear from bleeding out and fading away. I did need to reapply during the day but otherwise, it works well.",1
It not bad. I really wanted a roll on deodorant. I picked the wrong thing.,0
I have friends that like this product but for me I have very dry curly hair it did nothing an... I cannot get used to the fact that it has no suds... I probably use more than I should because it doesn't spread very well throughout the head but I guess that's what makes it natural and good for you for the price I didn't see any change worth using again.,0
"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1
This curling iron works just as I expected it to.  It gets very but there is no problem using it as it has a longer tip so no burned fingers.  This was recommended to me by a professional hair stylist (this is what she uses) and I could not have gotten anything better. I would not recommend it to anyone that does not have 100 percent use of hands to control it.,1
Did not work for me as advertised.,0
"This lipstick is creamy and goes on nicely.  I love the color so much!  I bought the lipstick because it is supposed to be non-allergic, but it still causes a bit of irritation.  Still, it's better than most.",1
"I have had this iron for just over one month and it already is not functioning. Will no long even turn on!

All I can say is this is the best shampoo I have ever used and I am very fussy about shampoos. I will only use this from now on until John Allans makes something even better!,1
I'm pregnant and wanted something natural. I couldn't handle the smell of this product. I sent it immediately back,0
I'm in love with this fragrance!,1
"Great smell, not anything special. Unlike their oil which is the best!!",0
"I seem to remember this product working better for me when I tried a smaller size of it over five years ago. Perhaps there was a formula change, or perhaps the product's efficacy diminished upon being left in the Georgia heat in high summer, but the product really didn't seem to work as well as I remember it working.

What I remember, however, was nothing short of a miracle. This product still does an excellent job of softening rough, dry hands and smells delicious. There is, unfortunately, a bit of an oily residue left from the lotion, which causes me to use it only before bed or while I am doing something that won't involve me touching things with my hands. Other than this, the product is wonderful for dry hands and I highly recommend it!",1
perfect nuetral w/o being colorless.  love it.,1
"After washing my face with Zirh Clean, it feels invigorated and smooth.  I enjoy washing my face twice a day with this product.  And am looking forward to using it for a long time to come.",1
perfect,1
"It actually works somehow!  We tested it by peeling an orange by hand, and even rubbing our hands in the Orange peels before washing. We did a before and after ""sniff"" test.  To use it, pretend it is a bar of soap, and rub it between your hands and fingers for 30-40 seconds under running water. After 30 seconds, we could still smell some orange, but we ran it for another ten seconds, and the odor was gone!  Only the slightest hint of orange lingered on our hands. The stainless steel ""soap bar"" smelled the way it did when it was first taken out of the box.  I am not sure how this works, but it does. There was no residue or any indication that the ""bar"" had been treated with anything, or that it released any liquid, etc.  It appears to just be a blob of stainless steel shaped to look like a bar of soap, but it works at taking away odors from hands!",1
I am one of the biggest fans of Super Skinny Serum. So I just assumed this would be just as good. Was I ever wrong. If you have thick coarse hair this just does not work for it. I was so disappointed especially when I bought it for full price. Maybe if the hair type was different it would work better but for thick course hair pass!,0
"The shampoo has the ingredient sulfate in it. none in the conditioner but still... i had keratin treated on my hair and the stylist told me not to use shampoo and conditioner with the ing sulfate in it in order to maintain the effect of brazilian keratin. so i don't use the shampoo, just the conditioner, it doesnt work wonders on my hair, i don't sense there to be much difference, then again, our hairs are different. Mainly its just the sulfate ing in it thats the deal breaker.",0
Not as sturdy as we would have expected.,0
The top won't stay on and the color vanishes very quickly. I will not purchase this item again.,0
"I think this is a great product and the smell is amazing, but when I got the bottle I ordered from amazon it had a crack in it and it all leaked out. I would suggest buying it in store...",0
This one really gets those difficult blackheads out of my nose pores really well. I use argan oil immediately after. Does a wonderful job.,1
"I have purchased at least six tubes of this lipstick from Julep. I have given them as gifts. It is the PERFECT red lipstick with an amazing staying power! A must have, the go to, lipstick! You have to try!",1
Worst polish I have ever used. Really thin product with a really thin brush. No coverage and very blotchy,0
I love this cream can't live without it,1
The lipstick was sent back not sure why???,0
I don't like this shampoo. I can't really identify what I don't like about it but it just isn't my preference. I'm now using the Matrix fiber Strong Shampoo and like it well enough.,0
"I read this stuff would give a better hold than regular pomade so I gave it a shot. $16 down the drain. It's garbage. It doesn't hold well and it leaves your hair crusty! Every girl loves running her hand through crunchy hair!

1 use = bottle sitting in trash can.",0
Brush is no good dye leaks on my counter,0
"I hate this dryer, the cold shot button never works right and the handle is awkward..leaves hair frizzy and cord is too short. I wish I could return it.",0
This is the only OPI polish I've ever bought that is awful. It does not have a smooth appearance even after several coats. Very surprised.,0
"One year later, and it's still working great. Leaves my hair shinier than other flat irons I've used in the past.",1
"I tried this item for the first time because I was told that it gives volume to your hair. However it made my hair very sticky and and I did not like that feeling in my hair. So after two tries of using this product, I did not like how it made my hair feel very dirty and gooey. So I have this product just sitting on my dresser that's worth $25.00 that I cannot use.",0
"There are much better purple shampoos out there!  I don't even notice a difference when using this.  There's not really a good smell with this shampoo either.  I end up using another shampoo right after this one so my hair will smell good. Will not be buying this product again. My favorite purple shampoo to date is daddy-o at lush, which I will be going back to after this experience",0
Thanks,1
"Excellent product!!  Was hoping a little more for a little more eucalyptus and a little less citrus, but it's certainly a high end after shave.",1
"I hate strong hairsprays that leave your hair ""glued"" into place.
W8less holds your style, but feels soft and natural.
My favorite hairspray.",1
too light,0
"Wanted to try something that smelled better than pureology hydrating shampoo and conditioner. I love how pureology treats my hair, but wasn't too fond of the smell. This keratindose shampoo and conditioner smells way better, but did not work for me. My hair is drier at the ends, it felt like my hair shed more, and it left my hair tangled after washing. Amazon definitely has a better price. I bought this product at CVS for a lot more.",0
totally overrated product.,0
"I love the Malie hand soap, so I thought I would try this, but it has a few shortcomings that will keep me from ordering it again:

1. The size: The bar is slightly smaller than your typical soap bar.
2. Lather: The lather ability is decent, but takes a bit more work than your standard bar of soap to build up a nice amount.
3. Fragrance: The fragrance is great...at first. The more you use the bar, the more it diminishes like it was only applied to the outermost
layer and quickly wares off.

This is one bar of soap for like $15...I get it's a luxury item, but for how long it lasts, it is definitely not worth it.",0
"Great product, worked great on baby acne , use it followed by aveeno baby moisturizer",1
"I bought this cream because I used to love (and recommend) the vitamin barrier ointment. It seems like this is the replacement for that cream. It doesn't spread well at all and hasn't had an effect on my daughters diaper rash.

I've switched to seventh generation coconut care diaper cream and it's incredible.",0
Did nothing for my hair besides make it smell great. Smell is amazing though but wouldn't buy it again. I was not even able to use 1/3 of the container before I donated it to my friends hair salon.,0
"This takes off nail polish so easily and nicely! I just dab some on a cosmetic pad, stick it on my nails for a minute or so, and it wipes right off! Doesn't smell as bad as other removers I've used. I'm really pleased with this!",1
"The taste is OK, but the smell is too strong. It's not unpleasant...just, strong. It's like perfume. I felt compelled to point that out, with so many 5 star reviews I was confident that I would be satisfied, but I can't use this anymore.",0
Love the product but the cap was cracked and broke bad enough it didn't stay on the bottle. Luckily it didn't leak,1
"On the whole, I like Jack Black porducts.  This facewash cleanses without drying out my skin.  The smell is pleasent.  Would recommend.",1
"I wanted to try the MARY LOU for a long time. When I saw this, I decided this was the better value. The quality and pigmentation is beyond words. The pans are not full sized, but very generous. This is one of my favorite palettes, which I reach for all the time!",1
"The Pocket Comb is a wonderful size for children, and is the only one I use on my 3 year old's hair. Recently I bought another comb in a high-end grocery store, thinking it looked similar to the Mason Pearson, but there is no comparison. The MP Pocket Comb glides through my daughter's hair and is very high quality. If you notice these things and are looking for a quality comb, this is the one.",1
This is a great product it's so refreshing and makes your skin feels so soft and moist and it smells amazing,1
its the only thing i can use on my sons sensitive skin that doesn't bother this skin,1
"I have almost black hair, and shy away from white products but tried this due to others' reviews..  this one's okay but honestly, I'm back to using cornstarch instead of it.  I feel safer using it, it has no funky smell, it's a lot easier to apply (my fingertips - and then I rub it around and use a damp cloth to get some of the whiteness out) and it's much cheaper!",0
Good quality powder with more natural ingredients than many others on the market.,1
poor quality,0
Amazing stuff for oily skin. Feels smooth and velvety.,1
"I am so happy using this awesome product, like clean beautiful skin and no more oil.",1
"I was wanting to find a product similar to Pureology Hair Products, it works well. I have naturally curly hair and it does keep the frizzy under control.
Will purchase this again.",1
IT'S A NICE FRAGRANCE BUT IT DISAPPEARS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.,0
"I've used the Cleansing Balm for 2 months now and am ready to review it.

The Balm is an average cleanser. I have combination skin and despite daily use it did not help at all with breakouts.

I personally think Elemis reviews their own products with high marks as part of their marketing initiative because I find the reviews on Amazon and the Elemis website shockingly similar.

This product did not work at all for me. I give it 2 Stars as a Make-up remover only.",0
"I bought this because I read an article where Jennifer Carpenter stated that she loved this lip butter. I had never heard of it before, but easily found it on Amazon. I paid slightly over $10 Prime, and it's nice, but unsure whether I'd pay that much again, when Nivea lip butter is pretty good, too, and costs 1/4 less.",1
"I had high hopes for this product but it did nothing for my hair. I think it made my hair ever drier and coarse. For a pretty expensive product, it didn't do much for me. I probably would not advise this if your hair is severely damaged from hair processing. I am disappointed bc it was so pricey and I could have invest that $59 in to a better product.",0
I adore sparkle and chrome color so this just adds some bling to my polish of choice....all things better with sparkle...like glitter for nails but much much much much better....perfect as a final layer under top coat,1
"I almost feel bad giving this review. The toothbrush has a lot of nice features: It holds a charge incredibly long. It's a good design. Here's the issue I had: The gray piece that holds the brush head broke off while I was brushing (this was after 5 months of use). Now there is no way to firmly attach the brush head. Hey, things break, that's life. I went to the FOREO website to see what could be done. Here are some things I found out. First, they don't have a customer care number for North America. So, I sent in an email to their usa customer care department. Then I sent another email. It seems they don't answer email. The message this sends to me at least is that if you have a problem with our product you're on your own. So, in short a good product with non-existent service makes this a poor investment. Buyer beware!",0
Fast delivery. Thank you. The description says Ember is a fiery red. Swatches I saw on Pinterest shows a fiery red. What I received is a polish that is beautiful but is very Orange named Ember. Correct coding from the manufacturer so maybe I got a bad bottle. Sigh. Still beautiful.,1
"I love these rollers. They heat up fast and create big, soft curls- just the look I was going for. They are also very easy to use.",1
"For a gloss, its pigmented and have beautiful colors. I recommended.",1
"I like the product because I used to use it before.
But the expiration date is March 2013.
I bought this January 2013 and I think the expiration date should be at least 1 year.
Especially for sensitive skin, expiration date does matter.
I am very disappointed.",0
"Perfect dry shampoo for brunettes! Smells great, doesn't leave my hair greasy or sticky or stiff. Spray it on, run my brush through a couple times, and it's good to go.",1
Love this color!  Just enough to give your nails a subtle painted look...so classy.,1
not a good product for me.,0
Its a big bottle that will last for the price. Keeps you hydrated.,1
"This is a really nice foundation that is packaged cleverly with a pump so you don't have to stick your fingers in it and possibly contaminate it with bacteria.  I bought the lightest shade 10 Watts because I'm ghostly and right now, in the dead of winter, it's probably a shade too dark but it really doesn't matter because it melts into the skin and doesn't look plastered on or fake.  It evens out minor redness and doesn't cake up into the fine lines starting around my eyes.  In full sunlight my skin looks dewy and fresh BUT you can see the little particles of Mica so if you dislike illuminating powders/foundations/eyeshadow you may want to skip this or try it out at a counter before buying.  Also, it's a little on the sheer side and I still need a concealer for dark circles and any blemishes that crop up because I don't like packing and layering foundation.  If you have troubled skin this probably will not offer enough coverage for you but it's perfect for a quick, natural look and is my new go-to foundation.",1
Broke today - just completely stopped working after less than 1 year.,0
"I gave this a try and only used it for 2 weeks because it burned like crazy.  It did help to eliminate the ingrown hair bumps.  However, it burned my skin and caused the dark spots on my skin to get darker.  I would not recommend this.",0
"I decided to try this stuff because of all the good reviews and I must say, I agree. I like it very much! Very moisturizing!",1
"Yes it smells good and it makes your face feel very soft, however, the brightening and tint aspect is very poor. Origins vitazing is much better!!",0
JUST OK,0
Seems to work.  Mix this in with Glycolic Shampoo for 4 days a month.  It helps.,1
"As they say, you get what you pay for. This creme is effective though pricier than what I used in the past.",1
I love this gel primer because it does live up to it's advertising and helps your skin be revitalized.  Thanks for making a product that is trustworthy and helps aging skin look better when used with the NuFace microcurrent technology device.,1
Not very shiny and bottle was broken upon arrival,0
Produces white flakes and leaves hair feeling really dry/weird.  Works but I would never buy again.,0
"Not as advertised do not blend into hair,
Looks powdery",0
Sprayer doesn't work. Bought sample bottle locally and sprayer stopped working after a couple of pumps. Tried this larger size and the same thing happened. Heard other people saying the same thing. Maybe in near future Paul Mitchell Co will design a different application bottle.,0
"I  have used this product for a long time, and find the ease and price and shipping all good.  Thanks",1
"Love the brand, love the subtle scent, & great for my sensitive skin. But I often sweat and have not yet found a great product to prevent perspiration",1
"These don't work very well. The clips don't hold the curlers in place well, and the curlers were not smal enough to give a decent amount of curl. I expected they would be smaller, since the set was billed as being for short hair. Disappointed.",0
"Smells like I washed my hair in a toilet and sprinkled tonsil stones all over it .
Feels wonderful. Shampoo smells fine . Conditioner smells like I mopped a nursing home with my hair even after rinsing.",0
"While i did LOVE the ease with which the eye cream went on, it didn't take much to cover the entire eye area, the lotion did not show any improvement in fine lines or wrinkles after a month of use.",0
"This seemed like a really well-made curling iron, but unfortunately it just wouldn't get my hair to hold a curl. I have really really straight hair and this didn't work for me regardless of the product I used on my hair to try to get it to work. Ultimately I just had to send it back.",0
"Some people claim this cream is watery consistency and has a weak smell. Mine is quite opposite - it stiff, hard to get and it literally stinks. I've never had anything sandalwood, but after this first experience I likely never will - it really stinks rather than smells. It is overpowering. The smell stays with me over the course of the day and brush keeps that smell even after three shaves with other non-scented shave cream. This means and inconsistent quality.

So, if someone is looking for a Art of Shaving Sandalwood Shave Cream with a thick consistency and a really strong smell - you can find it in my garbage can, barely started.

I have two other AoS creams - lemon oil and unscented and they are great. Great, but no better than Body Shop's, which costs 12-14 (7-8 if you get a deal). The same quality, less money, consistent quality, 6.3 oz vs. 5 oz",0
best serum ever. i use it everyday. a little greasy first but make skin very smooth after using it. excellent.,1
"It goes on thick and clumpy, and the color pictured in the sample and even when looking at the actual bottle is nothing like the color inside.  I ordered Amore, thinking it was a light rose-garnet color...that's what the sample appeared as, and even the bottle looks perfect, but inside is a lipstick that is almost black.  The texture of this product is also very thick and does not glide on at all.  I'd send it back, but I've lost the box, and I doubt it would be worth the cost of return postage.",0
"I would rate this ZERO. The product that I got was FAKE! I'm so happy that I saw a review from another buyer that alerted buyers of this and posted a picture. In my picture you will notice how the product on the packaging says ""eyelash & eyebrow formula"" and how the actual product only says ""eyelash formula"". The shipping in this product took forever as well and I checked out with prime.",0
Pretty easy to use for beginner. But the style is less flexible.,1
"Having light-medium skin tone, this `lou-manizing' bronzer gives a gentle glow, not being too shimery or overly `fake tan' type. It has a nice blend able consistency. Use as eye shadow and around the perimeter of face (near forehead hairline, and into cheekbone, down to jawline) for a `natural' looking glow. (Applied with a light hand.) High quality product.",1
nice,1
"Temporary lifting mask....the word ""temporary"" is perfect.  It defines the time that you actually have this stuff on your face.

As with any good clay mask, you feel a ""drawing"" or tightening as it dries.  Rinse it off and ""poof""....all tightening sensation disappears and there's no evidence that it did anything to actually tighten the skin.

My old face has pretty good skin on it so I guess someone who hasn't been torturing her skin with creams, serums, masks, scrubs, etc. might see a bit of difference.  But I sure didn't.  Not in tightness, not in pores.....nothing.",0
It smelled so good I did not want to get out of the shower.  I will buy it again.,1
"The brush was good at first, the wood split when it fell and I threw it away after a little while.",0
"Given how many stylists RAVE about this product I finally gave in and tried it. I'm really disappointed in the results. I've always used R+Co blonde (purple) shampoo, and I didn't see any superior toning effects, and my hair is SO dry and frizzy.",0
I have been purchasing this for years and love it until the ones I purchased in May 2016. I think rotten or old something is wrong with it!! Would return but got so upset one day I threw one out. My husband has the other container but not using like he used to. It is also rotten. Very disappointed.,0
Best curling iron I have ever used.,1
Makes your nails green. I think it almost causes more staining than without using it.,0
I really like this shampoo.  I have sensitive skin and this is one that does not bother me. It leaves my hair full and manageable.,1
"This is a nice, black mascara that does a good job of making my eyelashes look longer. The brush, or applicator, doesn't have many bristles to it and I find myself going over my lashes several times to make sure I get them all evenly. It does go on well though when I get all my lashes. They look black and even in length. The mascara is waterproof and I've never found it to run or smudge at all. I use cold cream to clean it off at night and it comes off fairly easily. If you're looking for a waterproof mascara, this is a good one.",1
The Amanda is a bit dark at first looking at it but its actual pigment is a soft color if applied right w capstick before lipstick :) I'd give it a 4 only because the picture isn't dark looking like it.,1
"The color was nice, but it by no means stayed on like it was supposed to. I was unimpressed after one cup of coffee.",0
"ok, so it seems like everyone loves this product... I don't really get it. I have pale skin with blue undertones and I have yet to find a look that works well with this product. it is very light, requires intensive primer to not instantly come off, and its not very highlighting! I suppose if you wear a very full face of makeup, it would work well as a powder highlighter finisher. for someone like me who wears a little concealer and powder, it's a bummer. the cost is the biggest bummer!",0
"I searched the web for the best price for this great product and once again, Amazon had the best price.  I go to Amazon first for all my on line shopping.  The product is wonderful and I use it with my exfoliation brush.  Just a dab is all you need for a great result.",1
Does not work at all. Felt furry and greasy.,0
"Smells terrible, doesn't clean at all",0
"I ordered this in light, and it is too light for me to use the concealer or foundation.  I love the iced mocha gloss, but it is a bit sticky when applied.",1
i feel the bronzer looks heavy and not a good look,0
Liked using this with the St Tropez Self Tan Bronzing Mousse but I've had 2 of these and they both came apart in about 2 months so I couldn't use them anymore.,0
is the best for my hair,1
"Have not purchased this but tried every color at a local beauty convention. Loved every single one! These are packed with loads of glitter. If you want a glitzy WOW factor to your look, these are it! They are made to use in top of shadow, but I'd use them on their own too. Every color is drop dead gorgeous!",1
"I didn't really notice a difference. My hair was still frizzy. I don't like to use a lot of spray on my hair. Maybe I should have used more. I don't know. Either way, I wouldn't buy this again.",0
Got this in an Allure Beauty Box and it stopped working in 3 days. Buyer beware since you can't charge it.,0
"I have aging, oily skin which is prone to hormonal outbreaks and this lightweight moisturizer is perfect for me. A little goes a long ways. It contains Hyalis which is wonderful for hydrating the skin. It has not clogged my pores or caused any outbreaks for me which can be a problem during the summer months with many moisturizers I've used in the past.",1
"Product arrived fast, and is as described.  My husband and I really like the smell of this soap.  It lathers well, nice and thick.  So far, no complaints.  Works well on sensitive skin.",1
"It's fake product be careful. Doesn't have the same smell, quality and hold as the real one",0
"I bought ""You sustain me"". The picture shows a pink polish, but the color is actually a light purple. It's nice nonetheless.",1
"So far so good, my facial gal recommended it and I am so far very happy with the coverage and it goes on very smoothly!",1
"A salesperson in a perfume store recommended Pink Sugar to me recently because I told her I like Prada Candy and other sweet smells.
When I looked up the product on Amazon I read many reviews and a lot of people seemed to be wondering/questioning if Amazon sells the original product.
The bottle I received says Pink Sugar on it and on the bottom of it says the manufacturer is 'Selectiva S.p.a'  Made in Italy. Does not say 'Aquolina' anywhere.
If you go to Sephora or Nordstrom Rack, it will be the same one by Selectiva Spa. I guessed they changed it. I never smelled it when it came out in 2004, so I won't know the difference, if any.
However, Amazon should update details so there is no confusion for perfume fans out there.
I liked this perfume when I smelled testers in stores and I am content. The only negative here is that the bottle was stuck inside the tube it came in and I had to cut it open, thus ruining the pink and white swirl container. Other than that, the perfume is exactly what I tested in Sephora and $40 cheaper.",1
"This is THE BEST leave in foaming conditioner!!!! I use it every time I wash my hair. It's super soft and luxurious and it's sooo light-weight that it's like not using any product at all. It smells divine like cupcakes or icing, but it's not too strong or overly sweet at all! It is a necessary part of my hair care routine because of how beautiful and controlled it leaves my naturally wavey hair with no heavy weigh-down or residue. I hope this product is around for a very long-time-to-come! I plan on being a customer for LIFE!!!!!",1
"I read great reviews and was really looking forward to trying this. Unfortunately, my experience is different than lots of the positive reviews. I find this dry shampoo to be very powdery and it leaves a residue-on my hair, my hair brush, my eyelashes if I am not careful, etc. I am more of an occasional user of dry shampoo. For me the object is more to ""refresh"" than ""degrease"" or volumize. I have used other dry shampoos (most far less expensive than this one) and this one is the most powdery, leaving my dark brown hair looking a little grayish, even after brushing it out. I feel like after using this product, my hair looks dull rather than refreshed and I honestly think my hair looks better dirty.",0
"I bought this straightener to replace a VERY expensive Paul Mitchell iron that broke after being dropped.  I had never owned a Rusk iron before, but had read great things and really wanted to give it a try since the price was GREAT here on Amazon.

It heats up rather quickly, and leaves my hair silky and shiny.  While I've got an average amount of frizz, I feel that I have less frizz with this iron than with other irons I've used in the past.  I've purchased irons ranging anywhere from $25-100, and feel that this is a fantastic buy for being a middle-of-the-road unit.  It doesn't have any bells and whistles, but the extra-wide plate is a great feature (especially when you've got ends that have a mind of their own).

The only con I could think of for this iron is that there is no light indicator that tells you when the iron has reached your desired temperature.  My old Paul Mitchell would go from a steady to flashing light when ready, so I knew I wouldn't be wasting my time once I started using the unit.

Overall though, this is a great iron that I'm hoping will last me a long time.  I travel frequently and treat them fairly rough, so we'll see!",1
"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1
"Packaging and design is beautiful but this particular product Davines A STRONG HOLD CREAM GEL is not good.  It's like putting honey on your head.  It clumps hair together, makes them sticky and completely unmanageable.  Directions on the Gel tube are not usefully.  I am completely stumped what was this product suppose to do?",0
"The container has false walls and a false bottom that reduce its actual size by about 1/3. I bought mine in a an AOS store so of course I noticed the (apparent) size.

I like the product, I just can't support this kind of business practice with anything higher than a 1 star review.

Edit Nov. 25, 2012: I'd like to make more clear that the issue affected me because I first bought the product in a store, where I held the cylinder in my hand before walking to the register and reasonably assumed it was full of product. Online, of course the fluid ounces is all you have to go by.

Deceptive packaging is still not an ok business practice for me. For me it still warrants a large rating demerit, though as you can see some other commenters feel differently. I wonder what else this company does deceptively besides putting false walls in their containers? Does anyone really imagine that this is the only thing?

I am increasing my review to 2 stars, not because I am any more happy with the deceptive packaging, but because after more use I think the shaving cream is excellent and even a good value, because you can get away with very little on the brush and still get a nice lather.",0
Seriously a savior in a bottle for us blondes !,1
"I ordered and even paid express shipping, after reading all the great reviews about this product. This curling iron is NOT heating up to it's potential, and so it does not create any kind of curls. It's SO frustrating. My hair is fine and easy to curl, but this iron is such bad quality that it can't even curl a small strand of hair. It's design isn't any better. My hand/arm hurt at the end of every ""curl attempt"". It is super HEAVY. Don't waste your time and money with this. If I were you I'd go to Ulta and actually try out a curling iron before buying then you at least know what you're getting for the money. Bad investment.",0
Nice and moist,1
I really see no difference. Not worth the $30. Any moisturizer would do as well as this did. I gave it a try will not buy again.,0
the lipstick won't stay up out of the tube to put on. bummer,0
very nice product; gives you some color without looking like you have foundation on plus it has the SPF built in.  I love EltaMd products.,1
"I received a sample of this in a little squeeze tube. Great coverage, went on smoothly, loved it. I went online to buy the full size, but it is only available as a pen.  The pen is NOT good at all. I turn the end of the pen to dispense the concealer and it does not flow to the sponge tip consistently. I either barely get enough concealer on the sponge tip applicator, or a big blob of concealer.......there is no middle ground. Very disappointed overall. I much prefer the squeeze tube sample. This is such a nice product but the pen itself is poorly designed.",0
"Purchased the Sandalwood  5 oz tub.  I had trouble working into a rich lather that I'm used to with my other products (ie Taylor of Old Bond Street).  After my normal 3 pass shave (using Edwin Jager DE89 and Astra blades), I had the WORST razor burn I've ever had.  Before switching to DE wet shaving, I'd sometimes get razor burn on my neck and never since, but on this shave it was my whole face.  I contacted AOS and they said that sometimes the Sandalwood cream would ""do that"".  Why would you sell a product for a premium price that ""sometimes"" tears your face up?  1 star.",0
"I bought this perfume because as a teenager I've had Roma lotion and I used to absolutely love it for nice,  unique and light scent.  The perfume was a complete disappointment - too strong.  I will be returning. ..",0
I love this stuff. Been using it for maybe a year now.  I wear it over their tinted moisturizer and together they make my skin look unbelievably healthy and illuminated. Over top I wear their facial highlighter + RMS living luminizer.  My skin really does glow.  I will cry if they ever take their facial highlighter off the market.,1
Have to leave it on for 3 hours my legs barely tan and no color on face or arms after 2 applications.,0
It smell great but it's subtle and it has helped to soothe razor burn.,1
too orange looking,0
"This does not work AT ALL it has made things worse, it has actually turned one little problem spot where my sports bra strap is into a huge breakout everywhere I sprayed it.... I figured maybe it was just cleaning out my pours and kept with it twice a day for two weeks... nope it has just gotten worse and worse over the last two weeks!

I chose to try this product out because it has the same active ingredients and percentages as GLYTONE

"This shampoo is great for dandruff, itchy scalp!
I have color treated hair and had no problems using this shampoo
It does have a great smell and does leave your scalp tingling.
My 20 yr old and I are both amazed.",1
"When you put a drop of the bliss Triple Oxygen Radiant Protection Serum on your finger, you can see that the serum has a pinkish / orange tint.  The serum also has a bit of shimmer in it which reflects light.  The tint and shimmer are not obvious when you put it on your face, but I assume that both are meant to contribute to the luminous glow that the serum is meant to give your skin.

The instructions indicate that the serum is to be used in the morning and night followed by eye and face moisturizers.  But, after applying it in the morning, the instructions recommend also applying a sunscreen.  The additional moisturizers are needed because serums are meant to be light and fast absorbing to give a high concentration of active ingredients without petrolatum or mineral oils that keep water from evaporating.

The serum is light and goes onto skin easily, but rather than to be absorbed quickly, it leaves a reflective film on the skin. My fingers also feel slightly oily after applying the serum, but that feeling goes away immediately with hand washing.  The serum has a light, citrus fragrance which fades quickly after application.

As far as results are concerned, I don't think that using the serum twice a day has added a glow to my skin.  I have only been using it a few weeks and the claims of younger looking skin that Bliss makes are based on an eight week study.  At first, I had written that I was seeing no results at all.  But after continuing to use the product, what I have found is that my skin around my eyes feels smoother with less pronounced wrinkles.  This I take as a good result.

Overall, a descent serum to be used as part of a skin care regimen.  It does help to soften skin and smooth wrinkles to some extent.  But, this does take time and so don't expect instant results.",1
I've used this a few times but I haven't noticed a big difference. I've noticed enough though to not be disappointed with my purchase. Not seeing a big difference could honestly be due to my hair being severely damaged already. Will continue to use as I color along with deep conditioners and regular cuts to get my hair back to a healthy state,1
This is my go to day cream. It's pricey so I only use it in the a.m. But it glides on my skin and I look lighter and my lines fill in a bit with this product. I use a makeup primer on top of it and then foundation and I've never had a break out. I've tried other moisturizers and nothing comes close to this that I've found. The only thing I hate is the price.,1
"LACOSTE LIVE FRAGRANCE GIFT SET FOR MEN

When I saw this one VINE I decided to treat my husband -- and here are his thoughts on this product - which, by the way, I think smells divine.

This gift set has a very pleasing scent that is pleasant, not too strong or over-powering.  I don't quite understand the fancy terms such as green leaves, aquatic notes, or smokey warmth of guaiac wood, but it just smells good, a very pleasant scent that seems to last once applied.

The packaging is in the style of a cube and that is unique and fits most decors.  These are two spray bottles; one is 100 ML, the other is 40 ML.

My husband is 63 years old and he says he is  fairly conservative [very] and he enjoys the scent of this product.  So do I !!  He's not sure about how well this cologne attracts women, and he doesn't think he will be able to quality that.  If you want a different yet pleasant fragrance, this would be a nice addition to your stable of colognes.  Me?  His wife?  I like it; it smells good on him!

Thanks.",1
"Dryer itself is fantastic.  However there is a design flaw with the concentrator nozzle, it spins.  My other Babyliss Nano Titanium had a stationary concentrator nozzle and that is what I have grown accustomed to over the last 5 years.  (seriously lasted 5 yrs with long thick hair using it daily to style and 3 times a week drying from wet)  I could just be being super delicate about it, but when you have long thick hair and you're trying to use your roller brush it becomes difficult to concentrate the air on one section when the nozzle is turning all willy nilly.  Yes I said willy nilly!  Its a southern thing!  Good for the price, but I think this bad boy is going to the gym bag, and I will invest in the Babyliss Nano Titanium again.",1
"too large for my short hair, I should have bought a smaller size.

 I also bought the miso brush , no improvement",0
"If you ever had a Clarisonic, you probably won't like this one. The brush felt rough and the charger was not the standard wall charger. Also, cleansing time is not set. I returned this and spent a little extra for another Clarisonic.",0
"I really enjoyed all three fragrances, they are light and clean, and not overpowering.  I do wish the bubble bath would foam a bit more and result in more bubbles.  The bubble bath does leave my skin feeling great, however.  All in all a pretty good product.",1
Nice product,1
I've been using this for MANY years! I assume it's doing its job!,1
It is a nice compromise between a heavy duty professional dryer and a cheaper consumer one. I will reserve the fifth start to see how it holds up over time. Most dryers I buy tend to stop working after a year.,1
"My nails are still breaking and pealing. My poor brittle nails used to be so healthy and strong. I don't know why but they are soft and weak now. This stuff did not help, had a strong odor, and didn't have a nice finish.",0
"I have bought a number of Lafco candles over the years, I never had any problems with any of them. I bought them in stores. I purchased this one on line  because I already knew the scent. When it came, the box didn't look, the label had been torn off. The candle is very loose, rattles around in the glass container. The bad thing is, I can't light it because the wick is pushed so far down in the wax. I tried digging it our,, it stayed lit for about 30 seconds. I have never had any issues before, but I don't know what happened here. I thew the box away, or else I would be sending it back.",0
The best,1
"Love, Love, Love  Bristles will hold my fine hair, no slipping issues. Give my coarse hair shine, volume and body.",1
I've been using as directed 2 times a day for 2 weeks now. I see a difference in hair growth it's a little bit slower growth than before. I use it on my face and it makes my face really soft and smooth. I will update later if I see that it the hair growth stops completely.,1
My friend swears by this stuff but it just doesn't work for me.  I have left this on for 15 mins (they say 8 max) and nothing really happens other than my cuticles are softer.  I could put on lotion for that...,0
did not work as advertised,0
Didn't work as expected. Keeps my skin soft but didn't notice any change in firmness or wrinkle reduction.,0
"I am a professional hairstylist and travel abroad quite a bit. I am amazed at the lack of dual voltage options for curling irons! I settled on this one because I couldn't find one in my local beauty supply. I think this is a solid product that heats up evenly and fast and stays hot! It definitely does what it is suppose too. For the reviews that say this doesn't hold a curl in the hair, well this size of iron is not ment to give a full curl, only a loose wave and maybe not even that for anything shorter then shoulder length. If you want curls go for 1.25 inch or smaller! For a dual voltage curling iron this is a solid product.",1
"I love Nioxin, but this product isn't always 100% necessary . When I do use it I use a very small amount.",1
But it's too expensive and the system 2 shampoo and conditioner do not work anymore. Apparently a different company bought out Nioxin and they have changed the ingredients in the shampoo and conditioner. I'm not sure if the ingredients have changed on the step 3 portion though.,1
I love the smell. But it is not very clean.,1
"I'm pretty simple when it comes to beauty care. I don't know anything about luxury beauty products and always do the bare minimal for my skin. I was genuinely excited to get this box and try to see what's so ""luxurious"" about them. Well... that turned out to be a disappointment.

The product says samples may vary but for the most part it isn't that much different from what is shown in the picture. I'm not going to list what I got because I'm lazy but I'll mention my lackluster reaction to most of them. There are 2-3 men products which I thought was amusing considering mostly women would get this. I guess we gotta give something to our significant other to make up for getting this box. Some lotions/cream with SPF... I'm allergic to something in sunscreen so I'm not going to suffer through those. Some anti-aging samples, I don't think I need to use those yet. Some hair oil samples... Sigh my hair doesn't really need it. Lots of perfume samples, not a perfume person but I can use them in my drawers. Toothpaste...? I didn't know toothpaste made in a foreign country (of course Italy.. why am I not surprised) is considered a luxury product. Maybe I'm just not classy enough to know things like that.

I only liked the AHAVA hand cream out of everything and it's only because it's a decent size. It can even pass off as a normal travel hand cream size.  Everything else.. well.. I probably won't even try 90% of the samples in this box and that's literally the whole point of this.

Overall, this box isn't really for me. If you really have no care for 'luxury beauty products', I think this box will further re-enforce that. I wouldn't have gotten this if it weren't for the promotion. I got the promo credit email like a day after it was delivered. I already spent it on something that I preferred/needed most... but even the $19.99 isn't enough to cover it. You'd still have to chip some in for these 'luxury products'.",0
magnification too big!!,0
"I saw a difference in just 3 days! I have a skin condition, keratosis pilaris, that causes my skin in the t-zone to have the appearance of small pimples and when pinched you see clogged pores. This diagnosis was from a dermatologist that recommend glycolic treatments and peels.
This produst has worked great without drying my skin!",1
"Love this line of products. Keeps skin hydrated, smooth and dewy.",1
Really makes your hair shiny....you can only spray once or twice otherwise it will make your hair look greasy. I like that its more natural than other products.,1
"I like the small size BUT did not notice that the tip of the hot tool has no plastic cover so you can hold the end with your fingers while you are
curling your hair.. I have burnt my fingers several times because the previous hot tool I bought had that black tip to hold.------kept forgetting.. As a creature of habit I now have to be extra careful when I curl my hair with this device.
And the normal thing to do is hold that tip.",0
I use the nail foundation and any lacquer.....and this is the only polish that doesn't created problems for my toenails.,1
"I really like Abba Root spray. I have very fine, limp hair. This gives my hair needed volume without being sticky. I squirt a little into my hand and then distribute it all through my hair. A little goes a long way for me.",1
It runs so you look like a raccoon after a few hours,0

FAKE!,0
It makes my skin very dry.,0

Save your money. Buy something else.",0
buen producto,1
"Just got it and it smells like baby powder almost, good thing is is that i love that scent. Feels nice and is a fine mist!",1
"I am very picky when it comes to cologne, I do not want to smell sweet at all. I want to smell like a man. masculine but not too much. however for the warmer weather I want to have a fresh sent and this gives me a fresh masculine scent. I went to the mall and tried or so many scents, and this one I had to get. I love the sandalwood note it has as a base.",1
Has bad ingredients in there and leaves a sticky feeling. If you like the squeaky clean fresh feeling this isn't for you.,0
Haven't noticed a change,0
"I have curly hair so ironing is quite a hassle.  This iron is probably the best one I've used, and I think I've used four our five different irons in my life.  It gets very hot quickly and the temperature adjusts well.  I usually take the comb off, though.  It's kind of useless.",1
Good value on an excellent scent.,1
Can't use this product if you have heart disease... The chemicals are bad for your heart... There is a warning on the box,0
"This is the only eye cream I'll use,, it has vitamin C in it, and all the ingredients are superb - I would know, I do extensive research for the ingredients on everything I buy, from clothes, to food, to this product!",1
NICE. WORKS WELL.,1
"WAY too light, barely shows up on my extremely fair skin",0
"These have parabens!! Do not use!! I bought them from Sephora not realizing that they contained parabens, and I had a terrible reaction. The description says organic... so misleading.",0
"I used this product for a few months, didn't see a change. I tried different products and my face feels and looks much better",0
"This stuff is awful. It is like an ointment, like a thick Neosporin or Aquaphor at double the price. It did nothing for my dry, flaking skin. I'm so sorry I spent so much money on it. Yuk.",0
"Works wonders with my thick, curly hair.  It's just what I needed to quickly style my hair when I want curls.  I am very pleased with my purchase.",1
I don't know how come you can get a 4.5 stars. I never have this bad experience before! I bought two of this item and both of them are broken !!!!,0
"I was excited to try a  ""healthy"" nail polish. I'm not sure if we are getting old polish or a knock off or what but it is awful. Both my sister in law and I ordered and it is streaky and chalky. I seriously can't stand it.",0
"After reading the reviews I decided to get a small bottle to test out this product. I can say, this stuff does a pretty good job of blending into my hair. At first I thought it wasn't going to work. It's not perfect and can get messy if you keep touching it or if you apply too much to one area. I was pleased to see it stick and hold into my hair. Overall it's a good product to conceal your balding spots if you have thinning hair.",1
I ordered this from the tv infomercial.  I'm allergic sulfates.  I'm not impressed with any of the line.,0
I like this face soap a great deal. Only time will tell if is worth the price. The smell is light and it gives enough foam to make it actually seem like it is cleaning your face.,1
Please Don't by these products; they are made with Human Fetus Parts. Search the internet for this company as being one of the many that use aborted human fetus parts or the mothers placenta to make their products.,0
"The bottle came broken- it's made of very brittle plastic, so if it makes it to you unbroken, be careful not to drop it- it would most definitely shatter! I was able to savage a bit to try a little of the product- it smells like butterscotch! I have very fine, thin hair- while a few spritzes of this left my hair soft and manageable, I don't think it did anything more than a regular conditioner. Not worth the $15 to me, glad I was able to get a refund since it came broken.",0
Daughter-in-law seemed happy with this color all though the top coat I ordered her was unusable.,1
"Ordered this soap for some friends for Valentines Day. It was recommended in a magazine, country living, I think. At $11 per bar, I could not be more disappointed! There is little or no smell, and the paper it was wrapped in was in terrible shape and seemed old and thin.  Definitely not fresh stock! Do not buy this soap!!!!!",0
"Horrible product, it's just like spray paint and doesn't set. If you touch your hair, which will feel like straw, it will get color all over it. And you can't return it so don't Amazon it. Buy it locally if you really want to try it.",0
"I love hour cool and smooth my face feels after I use Billy Jealousy's Shaved Ice. My skin doesn't burn anymore post-shave and I don't have anymore red splotches. It's a bit expensive for an aftershave lotion, but feel it is worth it. I'd definitely recommend trying it as a part of your shaving routine.",1
Love this brush.  Styles my hair perfectly! I would rate it a 5! Please Do Not Stop making it!!!,1
"My dermatologist promised this would work miracles on my dark circles, but I have seen no improvement at all.  It seems like a good eye cream, but no better than the eye creams I usually use.  For the price, it was a huge disappointment.

Pros:
Emollient eye cream
Moisturizer temporarily helps small lines

Cons:
Does nothing for dark circles
No better than most eye creams
Expensive",0
"I've had this curling iron less than 2
Months and it has already stopped working.",0

Excellent product - highly recommend!,1
I love OPI and the quality of their polishes so I thought this would be worth the money but my nails are splitting and tearing worse than they were before. I've used this daily to every other day for the past two weeks with increased weakening. I was having much better results with grocery market products. Very disappointing for such a high price.,0
"I had to return this item, the barrel is too short and the spring is not tight enough so it can not hold onto your hair.",0
They changed the original scent. I don't care for it,0
"I took a punt on this one,  and was delighted that the color was just as I had hoped!

This is the new Lorac formulation,  and actually I prefer the older one.  I don't know if it is the casing,  but this lipstick tends to get too soft in the summer and doesn't survive well in my handbag,  whereas the older formulations are just fine.  This is a great color and goes on easily and smoothly,  but it does need touch ups,  and it doesn't travel well.  (though in this very cold winter,  that's not a problem at all, in warmer climes it will be)",1
Much better top coat than any other regular nail polish product. Stays on without chipping/peeling for a long time. Great for using with nail art.,1
Item as described.  Quick shipping!,1
"Glad to have found this moisturizer on amazon, used to have to drive to my dermatologist's office to get the same product but a few dollars more.
This cream goes on lite and keeps my face moisturized all day long. Highly recommend.",1
Did not care for at all. Didn't even seem like a dry shampoo. Will not be purchasing this again,0
"It is fake. Contact clarisonic, due to i couldn't register this machine and it is functioning weirdly. It is a fraud. Battling!!!! Even when Amazon stated that XYZ is fulfilled by Amazon,  it doesnt mean anything. Dont waste your time buying this on Amazon...",0
"I am so bummed at this. My friend recommended this to me, since I have hooded eyelids and she said this wouldn't smudge. Finally get it, wear it once. It goes on easy....and then bleeds ALLL UP INTO MY LID AND THE CORNERS OF MY EYE.  Now, it didn't smudge onto my lids with a line like most others. It bled into my eyelid like lipstick can bleed into the surrounding area of your mouth if you don't line them.  Sad face--was much too expensive for this and now I can't use it! Won't buy again.",0
"Wow they sell these at my salon,  I have challenges with frizz and dryness, my hairdresser has been telling me to get this dryer for months.  She was right..it's fantastic, my hair is smoother and it holds style so much better.

Just fantastic!!",1
This is a great styling tool for someone who is not good with a blow dryer and brush - plus it doesn't damage my hair and is really easy to use - This is my 2nd one,1
"I was under the impression that regardless of the toppik size (sm,m,lg) the lid would be the appropriate rim size to fit the applicator. However, if you buy the small product size, the applicator will not fit and you too will be disappointed.",0
This is too stiff and doesnt smell like the paul mitchell hairspray I used to buy disappointed,0
Fresh scent that stays with you but not over powering,1
If you have sensitive skin watch out for this one its a very strong soap with a strong smell. It irritated my skin terribly.,0
"Great product overall.  Love the smell, feeling after washing.  very pricey however.  About same price as in local Bath Shop.",1
"It creates lots of flakes, don't like it.",0
One of the  jars was glued shut and when I finally got it open it was half used!  Since I received three jars I first used the two that opened easily. Since the final one was hard to open I just got to it because it was actually glued was super glue! My husband had to use a razor to cut it open and when we opened it we found out it had already been have used. What cheaters!,0
"I'm a huge Bliss Spa fan.  I've been using their heavenly Lemon + Sage Body Butter for years and recently discovered the Incredi-Peel Glycolic Pads (which easily rival Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Peel Pads for almost fifty percent less).  So I'm surprised it took them so long to release a line of color cosmetics.  Naturally, I was eager to give them a go.

Although I'm not a big user of bronzer, I'm also not very outdoorsy.  So sometimes it's nice to have a little color during the summer when everyone else has gotten a rosy glow from a day at the beach.  I've never tried the gold-standard of bronzers - Guerlain's Terracotta (which is a perpetual fixture on every magazine's annual ""Best Of"" list) because I wouldn't get enough use out of it to justify spending upwards of $50.  I have tried Physician's Formula (too dry and frosted) and Sephora's Sun Disk (too matte and orange), so I have those to compare this against.

This product creates an attractive, subtle glow.  It isn't too brown (which can read as dirt), nor too orange (otherwise known as the Lohan/Trump-effect), but has a natural rosy undertone that makes it flattering on my fair skin (with yellow undertones).  It goes on very smooth and almost creamy, similar to mineral foundations.  The only thing that was a bit startling is that, in lieu of frost, it actually has little bits of sparkle.  When first applied, they appear quite obvious which, for someone my age, is not particularly desirable.  However, after it settled into my skin, the sparkles were nearly invisible.  Still, I'd recommend a judicious application, because the sparkle/glitter effect looked okay on my cheekbones, nose ridge and over my forehead, but kind of weird above my lip.

Overall, I'd say this lives up to the Bliss reputation.  An easy way to create that healthy summer glow.",1
It's fine.,0
My hair is very fine.  The Fusion Hair Styler does not curl my hair.,0
love this lotion,1
Pasty so does not go on easy at all but that does help it to last somewhat longer.  I though the color would look more natural but it almost has a whitish paste color.,0
This is the first time I have used this polish and really like it .would buy again stays on long,1
"""Delicacy"" is closer to a light peach or pink-peach shade with a very muted shimmer. Very sheer with one coat and opaque in 4 coats but incredibly thick by that point.",1
"Guys, there is so much fragrance in this product. It works well, but the scent is so powerful it gives me a massive headache. Just a heads up!",0
"Darker than expected and NOT waterproof. It is easy to apply but I was looking for something that would stay on during a workout.  This is not the product.  On the plus side it is creamy and easy to apply but if you are looking for a truly waterproof, sweat proof long lasting product, keep looking as I will.  Will not purchase again.",0
"I bought this hair dryer about 18 months ago and within a year's time, the hair dryer started to give intermittent heat, which is very frustrating. It would emit heat and then switch automatically to cool hair while I just waited to switch back, very poor quality and very disappointing.  On top of that, the diffuser attachment would not stay on!  Farouk will not stand behind their product if you bought it anywhere on the internet, which is unfortunate because it's still their product and should have some means of satifying customers.  Most of the reviews for this hair dryer are consistent to this and maybe one or two get lucky and don't have problems, but if you're spending $100 on a hair dryer, you don't rely on luck!  This product just doesn't deliver!  I would not recommend this product, it is not reliable, poor quality and not worth it.  Try the T3 Featherweight or the T3 Evolution, they are more costly, but if you are serious about your hair dryers and want something that will last, try one of the T3's, but do NOT buy the CHI Farouk products.

"I returned this item. I absolutely hate it. It gets stuck in your hair causing some terrible frizz. I haven't used a thermometer, but I'm quite sure this flat iron does not reach 450F. Disappointed. For the price you pay I was expecting muuuuuuuuuuch more.",0
"The product ""Stila Illuminating Liquid Foundation"" is incredibly watered down. Feels like you're putting paint on your face, as you actually feel it dripping down your skin as you apply. At the same time, it feels heavy and sticky once applied. That being said, I was quite surprised to see how flawless my skin looked after using it. But if you're looking for something that will wear all day, this isn't it.",0
"It works great until it doesn't work!  After very little use, my Mia stopped holding a charge and Clarisonic will not provide support without a receipt and proof of purchase in the last year.  Poorly made.  I recommend buying from a different company.  $120 down the drain....",0
The stuff is the consistency of talcum powder. It is  awesome at giving your hair fullness and texture.,1

We use this cream on my two-year old's face because he was having issues with dry skin. It works great for him. However I just tried using it on my two-month old daughternwho was just diagnosed with eczema. She screamed bloody-murder every time I touched her with it.  I'm quite disappointed that I won't be able to use it on her.  I'll have to find something else.,0

"When I was offered a chance to review this product on amazon.com, the name looked familiar.  I asked my wife if she would like to try it in exchange for her opinion.

Here is what she had to say:

My husband knows that I like the ""Clean Fragrance"" brand. The company's philosophy is inspired by a simple concept to make the most of every moment and to fill each day with lifes perfect pleasures.

I have allergies and fragrances often cause me to have watery eyes, sneezing and if highly fragrant, I can have wheezing.  A whiff of Estee Lauderes Youth Dew or Yves Saint Laurents Opium can illicit all of the above and more.

When Tom  was offered a chance to review this product, I was happy that he asked me if I was willing  to try the fragrance ""Warm Cotton"" because of my prior delightful experiences with ""Shower Fresh.""

The Warm Cotton Clean Eau de Parfum has a light scent. It reminds me of cotton clothes when they have been dried outside on the clothes line in the sun. At the first spray it is a bit strong but quickly dissipates and you are left with a soft citrus light musk scent that stays with you through the day.""

Enjoy!

I like the light fragrance this product leaves on my wife and recommend it as a Christmas gift or as one for any special occasion in appreciation for the woman you love.",1
"This didn't control frizz on my 2abc fine dense hair. It made everything very poofy and broke apart all the clumps. It did not make my hair any curlier, and by day 2 I had to wash out and restart.",0
"The consistency of the cream is so thick that it is difficult to squeeze out of the tube.  The color is not right for me, either. I like the coverage, though.",0
"It is comfortable to use, however the beads fall off after one month of use. Very poor quality. I am disappointed.",0
"I do not recommend this product. The first application caused terrible flaking in my hair, it looked as if I had dandruff. I decided to wash my hair and apply to clean, product-free hair. The product once again caused flaking. Unfortunately, I can not return this product so I am stuck with it. Buyer Beware!",0
"I have tried to like this curling iron, I really have. All of the reviews say it's amazing so it must be me, right?
Well, I'm on my third one and it's not any better.
I have long, thick curly hair. I do keratin treatments and straighten it weekly. I only ""curl"" my hair with wands and irons after it's straight.
Two out of the three 1 1/4 inch wands that I have tried have not heated up well at all. With my wand (and any other hair product I use) I can't even touch my hair to test for ""heat"" cause it's so hot! With this one, when my hair is wrapped in the barrel, I can put my hand around my hair and barrel and it just feels warm, not hot at all! Then I start to worry that the hair inside the clamp is getting burned while the top hair is still cool, leaving MAYBE one curl in my hair. It's so ugly! but hey, at least the one curl it makes doesn't last! Even with hairspray and an hour of set time the curl falls out within the hour.
When I use curling wands, I NEVER have this problem. my hair always gets a curl and even setting it 15 minutes will leave my hair curled for days.
I want to use a curling iron so bad, I love the look of the ribbon curl and it's so much easier to use than a wand, but it's just not working out. But maybe my hair is too thick and too long for this curling iron, bummer!",0
Love it!,1
Can't live with out it.  Wen products are light and don't way your hair down like curly girl.,1
"This is nice and precise, stays in place and removes well. Like it.",1
Sent me the wrong color! Two stars only because before I realized the mistake I accidentally opened the tube and tried the product. It definitely smooths the skin and keeps it matte. Too bad I won't get to use it.,0
The photo is misleading.  The brush is not included.,0
"This palette is beautiful!  The colors are pigmented and blend easily.  I tend to wear mostly neutral colors to work each day, so this is a perfect every day palette for me.",1
did not see any results,0
"The nail polish has a nice consistency and I appreciate that it is non-toxic, which was the main reason I purchased it. However, it has proven to be ineffective, as it chipped and peeled off within a day of use.",0
Great stuff!,1
this stuff is the slam! Stays on all day. Looks good. I love this product.,1
"Does this product actually lather for anyone else?  Not too much the first time, but I usually wash twice (old habit)  -- and for the second wash, I actually get lots of creamy suds!  Just wondering if I'm the only one.  I did not purchase from here, but from JC Penney salon, so I'm pretty sure I have authentic product.  Having said that -- I love it.  Leaves my hair feeling cleaner than any other cowash I've tried -- and smells amazing.  This is a must-have product for me now.",1
One word. Amazing.,1
I felt that these were a pain in the you know what to use.  I used once and gave up.  I went back to having lash extensions put on.  Having lash extensions saves me TONS of time in the morning getting ready for work and that is priceless for me because I get to sleep in that much longer!!!  I would not recommend this product.  The glue was thick and the application process ends up all over the eye lashes.,0
"I have had the same model for 7 years and just about killed it when I bought this one. I figured I would stay with Hot tools, since my experience was so amazing. I am a hairstylist and use this iron 4-5 times a day. It squeeks, I tried oil and nothing helps. It sometimes heats up, Other times does not. Also I think the clamp isn't as tight. The hair falls out of the iron unless you use it like a curling rod. I think I will return this item.",0
"The Clarifying Serum has been life changing. Not only does it prevent pimples, it heals them super quickly without making me red or peely. AND sometimes I use it on my forehead lines at night and I wake up with much tighter more glowy skin in the morning. It's a great product and I've tried everything.",1
"I've been using neuLash for years and my lashes were so long and lush, I would get compliments all the time!!! But in the past 1 1/2 years or so, I've noticed my lashes aren't looking much different than before. They used to touch the lenses of my sunglasses and they don't anymore. They are barely better than when I first started to use it about 5 years ago. I am convinced the manufacturer has taken out some of the lash growing formula because it just doesn't work like it used to. I am very disappointed and wonder if it's worth the $$$ if I can't tell much difference. It's NOT cheap! My other thought is that you get immune to it!  Would love to hear some feedback.",0
BAD PRODUCT.,0
"I love duo fiber brushes, but this just didn't do it for me. The white bristles are too long, the black layer never gets a chance to buff out whatever you're putting on your face. I threw it away.",0
"Great for accept nails or to give interest to other opaque purples. Love it over Rock Royalty and Plum Paisley. Too sheer for use alone in my opinion and a little too dark for an accent nail over Tinted Love, but changes the color in general to create a ""new shade"". CND is always my go-to.",1
"Im a very big skeptic when it comes to beauty products that make big claims to reduce wrinkles. However, this Anti-Wrinkle Firming Moisturizing Filler did seem to slightly reduce the appearance of the small lines around my eyes and moisturized my entire eye area without leaving it sticky to the touch.",1
Love this eye cream!  I have very sensitive eyes and no problems with Neocutis Lumiere.,1
It stopped working literally the first time I started using it. I managed to get one strand of my hair dried before it just wouldn't turn back on. I guess I got a defective product but I'll be returning and probably won't try this product again.,0
Glad I got the smallest size to try. I keep my hair cropped pretty close (1/4-1/2 an inch); this ended up just looking like powder on my scalp. The medium brown also has a green tint to it.,0
"I bought Rusk Thermal Flat Iron Spray with Pure Argan Oil at Marshalls for $8.99 while on vacation.

  I used the spray as a heat protectant when flat-ironing with a Nano Titanium Babyliss Pro. I would spray lightly over slightly damp hair, and let it dry. I can say that this spray gives good hold - too good. It made my hair as stiff as cardboard, and brittle.

  I thought the spray would work better if sprayed very lightly. Doing so gave me perfect hold without stiffness, but made my hair length look and feel dry and frizzy, and the ends brittle and frayed. The appearance and feel of my hair would worsen throughout the day, as if the spray starts sucking the moisture out of the hair the instant it's applied and keeps depleting moisture until the hair is left dehydrated.

  Finally, I tried just using it as a finishing spray instead on hair curled with curlers, but had the same unpleasant results.

I usually use only natural oils and natural butters (like shea) in my hair, so as the only change in my hair routine, this product had to be the culprit. A few days after I'd started using this spray, my scalp became dry and itchy, and I actually saw a few flakes. It wasn't until I quit using the spray that I realized the spray was the cause of my scalp problems, too.

I had to deep condition three times and cut off an inch of hair before my hair thrived again. Washing my hair with a few drops of iodine diluted in water calmed my scalp and stopped the itching and flaking caused by this product.

I hated to waste an $8.99 product, so I gave the can away, thinking it might work for someone else. The woman I gave it to used it on a synthetic wig, and noticed later that same night that the wig had frizzed out badly. She had to cut her wig in order to save it. She returned the hairspray to me. The spray canister was nearly full when I dumped it in the recycling bin. Money down the drain.

If you make the mistake of buying this product, please test it first on hair that you trimmed off or on fake hair, and you'll see that I am not exaggerating. I don't want to see other people damage their hair unnecessarily. This is the worst product I've tried in my adult life. It's a shame I paid this company so much just to damage my hair and scalp.  This product claims to make hair ""smooth, silky soft, sleek and shiny"" - but beware of the false advertising, because it does the extreme opposite.",0
"Causes break out

"Great for a few months, about ten. Just placed in garbage. Stopped holding charge. Gave up. For a premium price.  Not happy with product.",0
"It's a spendy product for one usage - mine clogged after using it ONCE. I've rinsed the tip, the cap's spout and underside after popping it off, hot water, cold water, warm... doesn't unclog.  WHAT A WASTE!!!",0
"beautiful color but it is too old, dried out and thicken, very difficult to apply",0
The standing metal fall down when I took it from the box.,0
"I have to say that I am VERY dissapointed that this cream i've been using for years, has parabens!  Many experts point out that parabens are NOT safe at all.  I do NOT want them absorbed by my body in any way, shape, or form.  I wish I knew this before I spent a good amount of money on this product, as I am well stocked.  I have to now throw my stash of YU-BE away, since I do not want to give or sell it to another human being!  What a WASTE!  And I really liked it's effectiveness...",0
Great product delivered firmly.,1
I like the texture but the only reason I bought it was because the lavender one was not available.  The smell does not compare.,0
"The product works good with multiple heat setting, one missing feature is the automatic turn off.",1
"This is the SINGLE best purchase I have ever made in my life. Smells decadent, but doesn't ""hang"" in your hair... the smell eventually fades when it dries so it isn't overwhelming. Even my mother who is allergic to most smelly lotions, hair products and perfumes loooooves this oil. The oil pours out about the consistency of war m honey and soaks right into your hair without leaving it feeling greasy at all. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now, and the ONLY downside I can see to this product is that my hair doesn't hold a curl as well as it used to before I used the product, but if I strip my hair, I'm sure it will still curl... it's just made my hair just too damn healthy!",1
it doesn't curl my hair at all I've tried curling my hair on every temp. but it just doesn't work I don't like this curling iron,0
"It works. I have been using this product over the past few weeks. My skin is less dry, which is good. Winter is generally a time that fosters dry air, which in turn can cause dry skin (this sucks). So, I turned to Baxter's AHA Night Cream.

4 STARS because it works and it's just not a five star product.

Calling this a five star product would be analogous to calling Sheraton a five-star hotel.",1
I went hiking with this on and got a sunburn.  Not a bad one but still not impressed.,0
"I use 3 coats of this over my color and the shine is like you'd see on a new car. Even with loads of hand washing and dishes, it looks great for at least a week. Totally recommend!",1
I love this styling product!! My hair is super thick and frizzy and it does wonders for it. I think I have tried everything out there and this stuff really works!!,1
It didn't seem to do anything for my hair. It smells great though!,0
"This is the 2nd BaBylissPro Ceramix Xtreme Dryer that I have bought and has gone bad just past the warranty period.  I love the way it handles, dries my hair fast and doesn't get too hot.  But a $50 dryer should last longer than 2 years!!  It started sparking while I was using it and scared me to death.  The cord had worn through close to the base and I could see the wires.  So frustrating and will have to find another dryer this time as I'm tired of replacing it!!",0
"There must be a huge quality control problem in the manufacture of these: many people recommend, I've even seen them ""reviewed"" positively on a review site, BUT 5 of the 8 rollers have fallen apart in my set -- the plastic just crumbles; one or two never would heat up at all, AND often they would get so hot as to burn my scalp.

I've used hot rollers for a long long long time, this is the most expensive and worst set I ever bought. I didn't try to return it because I'm lazy, but I'd like to.",0
"I have been married for close to 24 years, and hubby has always used Edge Sensitive Gel, no matter what razor. But after my great experience with a Vichy facial serum, he figured that it was worth trying this. He used it once and tossed it. His skin was irritated, especially his neck, which was scraped and red, and his shave was not as close with the same razor.",0
"This item is very small, I tought I would get something bigger. I bought it with another babyliss flat iron wich I loved. But this tiny one was a waste of money I would not recomended.",0
"I have used this shampoo for years because it made my hair feel healthy and it gave my hair great body. With the change in the formula, it is totally different and has dried my hair out. It is now a very harsh shampoo. i won't buy it again and am seeking a replacement like what the product used to be.",0
"My hair is a mixture of types.  About 75% of it is thick/coarse, curly hair, with frizz and flyaways,  The curl type is between 3b and 3C.  The hair is wavy hair for about 6 inches from the roots, then it curls, ending in with corkscrew curls. The other 25% is a mixture of straight and soft waves.  It's half way down my back, just past my shoulder blades when wet.

I do not want to do a Brazilian keratin treatment because I like my curls, and do not want straight hair.  I just want the frizz and flyaways to be gone, and for the curls to be a little softer.  So, I've been on a quest to find a product that would calm down my hair a bit before I go Brazilian in desperation.

This product wasn't it, though I was so hopeful because of the previous previews.

I tried using a couple quarter-size portions in my hair.  DIdn't do much.  Next, I put at least five quarter-sized portions in my hair, and made sure it was covered.  It smelled great, and it made my hair feel softer, and as much as I put on, my hair never looked greasy, but it still didn't do anything for the frizz and flyaways.  My hair wasn't any more manageable than before.  Worse, both times when I showered after having used L'Anza, my hair felt like lead when it got wet.  Brushing through it in the shower was like brushing through drying cement.  I lost a lot of hair from brushing it.

My last test was attempting to brush my hair when dry.  The same thing that always happens when I've done that, happened.  It took several attempts to brush through a section of hair, and my hair puffed out in an afro.  The best way to describe how I look when I brush out my hair is for you to look at the character ""Alice"" in the comic strip Dilbert.  My hair puffs/frizzes out at the ends just like that.

Because of the cost, I don't want to throw it out, so I'm using it as a skin lotion.  On to the next product.",0
"Very cheaply made, no powerful at all. I would use on someone with very fine hair and not too long Orr too much hair. A waste of my money .",0
"HI IT""S sticky. Not sure how old it is.. But it feels sticky .. tacky..
Thanks
I would return it... And I just might.

"I was very excited to get this product! Shipping was pretty fast and was delivered sooner than expected. However when I went to use the product I noticed that the mousse was GREEN! Super disappointing. Now waiting for my replacement, hopefully the new one will be better!",0
No expiration date on bottle. Must be fake. Used Obagi for ten years!  This doesn't work! Don't waste your money!,0
"Too expensive and not effective on my oily, blemished face. Recommended by my dermatologist, and it was a disappointing experience.",0
Awesome coverage!! Love it,1
"I have very fine hair, and this leaves my hair stripped of all oils. Not good.",0
"Excellent shave soap! I have tried other shave soaps, but none that provided the thick lather that the Proraso shave soap does. I have been shaving exclusively with is shave soap for two months now and have barely used an 1/8th of the container. As a result I feel the size is generous and it will go a long way. I recommend this shave soap for your next safety razor shave. I drop a little water in the top of the container and let it soak for around a minute, then pour out the excess, when I use my wetted brush on it it provides a quality thick lather. If I leave any water standing on the soap or he brush is too wet it can come out as a thin lather. But I think that is technique related not a product flaw. I will be reordering this product when my current container runs out.",1
"If you ever noticed your scalp getting dry, and itchy after years of the same bargain shampoo then you're like me.
I asked an ""x"" if she ever had an itchy head and she shared this with me.
This shampoo is luxurious and pleasant.  It is soothing to your scalp.
Like magic my scalp didn't itch, it wasn't dry any longer, and my hair was clean.
This is a great product.  It is expensive but if you've started trying one shampoo after the other it will end up costing you about as much. When you're searching you have no guarantee that the test shampoo will work; this does and it's worth every penny in the long run.  Do I wish it were cheaper: YES.
But I don't have an itchy head.",1
"I love the color of the bronzer, however, it does not leave a bronze glow on your skin at the end of the day. For that kind of money, it should be an awesome bronzer AND self tanner and it's not. Will NOT purchase again.",0
"I bought this unit directly from the company. The first unit that came gave me shocks--something was obviously wrong with it, so back it went. The techs there couldn't find anything wrong with the unit. That surprised me, as the shocks were constant and substantial enough to hurt. The second unit that was sent as a replacement was a used one. No shocks, but it was obviously used--pretty tacky policy, considering I paid for a new unit. Can't say that I saw any difference when I used it. The feeling of the electricity and the flashes in the eyes (normal, per their brochure) were uncomfortable. An expensive mistake.",0
I am in love with the way this product leaves me and my bathroom smelling. Leaves you feeling and smelling clean and leaves your bathroom smelling like a spa for the day. I use this daily and would recommend it to everyone. The 33ounce bottle will last an eternity!,1
"I am so disappointed with this product.  The color is nice and it applies well, but those are the only nice things I can say about it.  The packaging is terribly cheap.  The first time I ""unscrewed"" the top of the gloss side it just slid right out.  It does not screw shut so there is no way I could carry this in a purse, pocket or anything like that.  It's like one of those awful, cheap plastic toys you get as a kid that never really fits or closes properly.  And then, to add insult to injury, it just does not wear like I would expect something called ""fixation"" to wear.  By lunch time it's gone, and that's _before_ I eat.  I'm used to real lasting products like Lipfinity (the best- sigh) and Mac has a good product too.  This product is just not up to snuff.  It feels like one of those Barbie products for little girls, who don't know what good cosmetics are.  Well Jane Iredale, I do know what good cosmetics are, and this isn't it.  I wouldn't pay $2.00 for it, I'm really sorry I paid $32, but I won't do it again.  I hope to save anyone else from making the same mistake.

Update Dec 2014- I was just looking through my past reviews and I saw this one and realized that the picture of the product associated with it is not what I bought.  The picture is now some sort of pot product (not marijuana, but something in a little flat screw top container).  The product I reviewed was a stick lipgloss, and my thoughts on it have not changed.",0
excellent product!!!,1
"I love the size and smell of this sunscreen but leaves your skin kind of slick. I guess I suspected that because it is an oil, and the fact that it could double as my sunscreen and my lotion and was small enough to fit in my carry-on on a recent trip made it worth the purchase!!",1
Make up compack was broken.,0
"I am disappointed in this cream. I was hoping to see better results, but maybe I am being impatient. I have been using the cream for a little over two months and I have yet to see any results. For the amount of money I spent on the cream, I would have thought I would at least see some improvement, but maybe I do not have that much that needs improvement on to show a dramatic result. This might be an unfair review, so please do not take it to heart. Others may see better, faster results if they have more wrinkles or skin damage. I was hoping to get rid of some minor wrinkles that I started to see appear around my brow line and eyes and my dark circles under my eyes. Not the case. I will not purchase this product again.",0
Love it..,1
"Awesome.  It does get hot and there is only one heat setting; however, I always use the high on my big one anyway.  I will say though that because it is so small, you do need to be careful when using it because it is easier to get burned.  I also purchased the BaByliss travel hair dryer and they both fit in a small pocket of my toiletry bag!!  I love them both.",1
"The last two bottles I have ordered have been defective and do not spray. This is in addition to a bottle I ordered a few months earlier, not working.  Although I like the product, the bottles are defective.",0
yellow color is veryyy pretty and nice tho the bitch smothers and takes hella long to dry like clay on ur nails real heavy,0
"I did not realize I was buying the version for dry/damaged skin. It was WAY too greasy for my normal to oily skin, I could feel it all day. That said, it feels super rich and creamy, so if you have dry skin it might be perfect! A little white cast, but not too much.",1
Love their products - really remove pimples quickly without burning. Does not stain your pillow if you use it at night.,1
"It is not a heavy flat iron, it is very easy to use. Works good for my hair.",1
"I have had this hair dryer for 2 years now. It was great when I first started using it.  I need the concentrator to style my hair and the concentrator just slides onto the end of the nozzle. Over time, it would would start flying off when I used the high speed on the dryer.  When I would pick it up off the floor, it was burning hot so I had to use a towel to put it back on the hair dryer.  After numerous times of flying off the hair dryer, the concentrator cracked.  This made it worse as it would not stay on at all anymore.  I've been looking at newer models of the same hair dryer and it seems that they have not had any complaints about the concentrator because they are still made the same way so I a staying away from BaByliss, which is disappointing since I really like the hair dryer. My other complaint was that it was just too heavy. I'm trying so hard to find a hair dryer that will give me the results that BaByliss could.....just wish they didn't have the flaws that really bother me.",0
This came with no protective deal. It was also very different from the one I got while living in Canada from the drug store. It has a very strong chemical smell and feels less moisturizing. Returning it and getting it from Ulta for the same price.,0
This is the best I use for hair,1
"This is my second Clarisonic.  It doesn't work miracles, but it does keep my face clean and relatively free from breakouts.  A staple for me.",1
"i love this product...so non greasy and smooth.  I especially enjoy the lightly tinted line of this product and I'm sure you will, too",1
Best product I have ever used for my thinning hair!  Cannot be without it.,1
"Was looking for an AHA based body wash to help my body acne, hyperpigmentation and discoloration from left over body acne. Was a reasonable price so I bought it. A few things: the smell. It is definitely a turn off but it goes away once you rinse it off. I usually don't care about smell, but this was a very granny, rose scented smell that I didn't like. I would be able to tolerate it if the product was effective (for me). I will say that within two days off use, my skin was smoother AND noticeably brighter. But on day three I noticed I was breaking out ALL over my body and this product is deinfitely the culprit. So while it made my skin brighter it gave me body acne all over, kinda defeats the purpose. My search continues...",0
"It works fine, but does not sooth my skin so much.",0
received quickly and as expected. Nice price...,1
Love the scent but had no top.,1
Price is great. Lasts about 6 months,1
"This works good on my dry frizzy hair, used it for over 10 yrs.",1
Used it once & it burnt my skin on the tear trough hollow... it left my skin so red and I decided to return it,0
"Arrived intact, I haven't used them yet so I'm unable to give a fair review",1
"This dryer was great for the first couple months. Around month 4 the high heat setting got noticeably hotter--my hand would get burned if I touched a section of hair after the dryer had passed over it so I had to start using the medium heat setting, which isn't hot enough. It is now month 8 and the air flow has slowed significantly over time. This morning while I was drying my hair the air flow slowed further and it took ages to dry my hair. Very disappointed",0
I will start by saying I am not much into products and find even at 40 less is more.  I used this serum sporatically for a couple weeks after I received but have discarded it due to the slight burning sensation and when I use it.  It also is not a smell I find relaxing or enjoyl good putting on my face.  Does it work?  Good question.  Maybe for some but for me not a great purchase.,0
"After a month, my skin had ZERO change...my face is still as oily as it was.",0
"I recently purchased this on clearance at a local beauty retailer. I had seen some of this line on you tube being used by a set of twins from Alabama, and thought I would try it since it was on clearance. I am new to the natural hair scene, as I have completed the transition over the past 1yr and 8 months. I have become a product junkie, and have never experienced a product such as this. The smell is terrific!! The hair was left clean and well moisturized. Usually, I have a difficult time combing through my 4b hair but with this, the manageability greatly improved, EVEN AS IT DRIED. I am so impressed that I can't help but keep touching my hair. You must follow the directions and understand that it is a CLEANSING CONDITIONER. Not all products work for everyone, but this worked very well for me.",1
Nice toothpaste and great packaging.,1
I had been eyeing this up for years and finally bought it.  Love it.  Excited to try No. 2,1
Thick and slightly tacky.  I will not buy this again.,0
It's totally worth all of the rave reviews. It's gentle but not oily which is nice. It took off pretty much all of my eye make up with one or two swipes. No multiple cotton balls needed.,1
Wasn't impressed with this product.,0
It's great,1
THIS IS COOL,1
Dried out my hair.,0
"My colorist used this on both my daughter's hair which is waist length with highlights  and my hair which is bleached.  I bought the number 3 and took it home.  It made a huge difference, especially my daughters hair.  Her hair felt like straw...literally so dry and damaged from the 2 years of flat ironing on 450 degrees.  So I began reading and watching every you tube video and learned that the No. 1 is 100% is pure active ingredient, No 2 is about 15% active ingredient and No 3 is about 12% active ingredient.  So I bought the 3 pack 17.5 oz each.  I put No 1 on my daughter's hair...she took 3 times the amount because she has so much hair. Meaning 9 0z water and 4.5 oz of Olaplaex No 1.  I put a bowl under her hair and kept refilling the bottle I was using with the ""run off"" from her hair so it could get totally saturated.  I left No 1 on her hair for about 15 minutes then added No 2 for about 30 minutes.  Her hair is now AMAZING!!! Shiny, Soft, no tangles at the ends, absolute game changer.  I gave her the exact treatment that they give at Beverly Hills salons for super damaged hair and this is Not watered down!  It is ridiculous that every singe 1 or 2 star review for this product is a ""non-verified"" purchaser.  I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon and I have never seen a product with so much fear from ""the professionals"".  I HIGHLY recommend this product line from any of these vendors on Amazon.  I paid 254.00 for 52.50 ounces and 1/3 of that is super potent versus my paying 45.00 for 3.3 oz of No 3 at 12% active ingredient.  We use it about every 2 weeks and we should get a years worth.",1
"Works great for my very long, abused blond hair!  Smells sooo good!",1
Love this stuff! It makes my skin look fantastic. I.am giving it four stars because its so expensive,1
These don't hold all types of hair as advertised. Mine is of medium to fine texture.  I will be returning them,0
I favor masculine smells. This meets my standards and smells good while leaving my face happy. I have made this into my travel shaving soap. Its really more a cream than a soap. The dish it comes in is made of plastic so no worries on throwing it in my travel bag.,1
I had really high hopes for this product but I honestly hated it and ended up giving away to a family member after use. The scent of rose was wayy to strong for me especially since I have bad allergies with strong smell so it made me sneeze uncontrollably. I was using this along with the another product and the other product caused me to have a reaction and develop a rash and when I sprayed the rose water spray on my face it burned and cause my face to become even more red obviously this is my fault because the product is meant as a toner. But i felt this product is wayy to strong especially for people with sensitive skin because its pretty harsh and very harsh and the smell is way too much for my allergies. So I really wouldn't recommend it for sensitive skin and people who don't like alot of fragrance. And lastly how the hell is this suppose to improve my skin like i would spray it on my face and be confused of its purpose and I used before and after makeup but I have my mac fix plus for that and it doesn't have a harsh smell that irritates my nose. So overall it was bad my but sister who also hated the rosewater really liked the cucumber scent that Mario Badescu have so I would recommend trying that one instead of you wanna try this product.,0
This product wasn't for me. I read other reviews before buying it and decided to try it. It left my hair feeling not soft or manageable. It felt kind of waxy. It just didn't work for my hair. I'm still looking for the right product.,0
"lid was not tight, so 2/3  liquid leaked also, I tried to returned but this one can't return.",0
"This face wash is amazing... I am so glad I tried it.  I am 23 and was struggling with acne.  It seemed like every few days there was a new pimple. I was using clinique acne solutions at the time and finally realized I needed to try something different.

3 days after trying this face wash my skin was clearer than its EVER  been and has stayed clear.
I had developed a few acne scars and those are slowly going away now after 3 months of use.

Remember to wash with a dry face!!",1
Seems to be watery. Not sure if it was watered down.  No strong smell like normal.,0
Blind liquid eyeliner did not meet my expectations,0
"I'm a skincare junkie and honestly this didn't do much. The hype is too much. I'm trying the origins spot treatment. It just gets on your pillow and I feel like it makes my zits bigger in the morning with more pus, making me even more likely to pop it.",0
"I have bought this product elsewhere before and loved it, but this time the one I received was very clumpy.  Not sure if it is just really old, but nothing like the first time I bought it.  Very disappointed with the quality that I received.",0
This is not near the same product at the one I purchased at the store. It seems that is not the same product at all.,0
"Its so expensive and it doesn't have the result we expected  it. Also, the seller delivered it late. They don't return it.",0
I think the price was high. $14.99 seems more reasonable. Also does the soy version burn cleaner???? I have asthma and would like the best version of this scent as I absolutely love it.,1
"I have been using this product for years with complete satisfaction. For some reason, this last can of spray is different than the others. This has a very bad smell to it. They must have changed the formula or something because this stuff, for lack of a better term, sucks!!",0
Smeels great ...for about a minute. Does not last at all. Very sad.,0
Pretty!,1
Love it!,1
Excellent product that lasts a long time.,1
"Please don't get this, it crusts on the lip and goes to the lash line and is VERY VERY HARD. to get off!",0
"This item was requested by my daughter-in-law for her birthday, which will be in several weeks.  ( I like to shop early.) The gift box was well wrapped in bubble wrap and the outer envelope was likewise well wrapped, which leads me to believe that the gift box itself was torn before it was prepared for mailing!! Little crumbs of wax--not much--were in the box, but not enough to damage the frog. I taped the corner which was torn from the edge to the top and will apologize to my daughter-in-law rather than send it back, but won't be ordering anything else if this seller is involved.",0
Product blocks pretty effectively and it does not feel sticky like some other products. Feels light on in a hot summer day and it's a good value for 8oz.,1
Good color comes off after every shower and smells exactly like the other 20 I have tried.,0
IT DID NOTHING FOR MY HAIR!,0
"This smells great.. I like it a lot.. IF you can afford it. Very expensive I think. if this is a gift, I would definilty purchase.",1
"This smells weird. Like it's not the same glo finishing spray that I bought over the counter at the glo salon. Maybe it's  expired , but it's doesn't appear to be the same spray. The smell is what gives it away, also it's thick misted. Who knows maybe I got a bad bottle??",0
"This box is a GREAT value, I received 20 high quality samples of various products. Lotions, perfume, masks, nail polish, toothpaste, shave gel etc. All high quality products fitting the ""luxury"" labeling but the best part about it is that this box is essentially FREE because of the $20 credit for a full size luxury item from the list. A free way to treat yourself to some great products! Anything I don't use works perfect as little presents or stocking stuffers too",1
Best file I've ever used!,1
"Love it! Heats up fast and stays hot, holds curl all day long. Nice that it has an actual of/on switch.",1
"I bought this brush because Ulta was out of stock of my FAV It brushes.
I saw this one for $30.00 and heard about this brand but never tried it. First time using this brand of brush.
I use it for blending and buffing my concealer and foundation and applying bb powder. It works well and no shedding and washes well,no bristle fall out. Overall good brush but Expensive for being made in China!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
I was expecting to see results with this product after reading all the hype.. Very disappointed. Waste of money indeed.,0
Used religiously for several weeks with no results other than irritation and itching. Don't waste your money.,0
No difference...ive been using it for 2-months,0
"I was given my first tube and liked it so much I'm buying it now and have actually 'subscribed' for delivery every 2 months.  I'm 64 and have the usual complexion issues associated with being a senior; dark[er] under-eye circles, bags and a few age spots.  The Pur Minerals Disappearing Ink Concealer 4-in-1 is wonderful for hiding EVERYTHING completely without caking or settling into fine lines.  It is creamy and feels like it's moisturizing while hiding any issues we may find.  I absolutely love this product and recommend it whole-heartedly to any senior ladies looking for a great fix!",1
very nice fragrance,1
One star only because I received totally different product.,0
"This is not for me.  Too powdery, can't put it where I want it. It just awful on my hair. Tried it once and that's enough for me.",0
Love this product!!,1
"It lives up to its name and gets hotter than drugstore variety curling irons.  It also heats up much faster so all in all I can fix my hair very quickly with this.  I love that the cord does not twist up and the overall feel of the iron is good quality.  It also comes with extra springs which always wear out first.  My hair is med/fine with some natural curl so it curls pretty easily with this one.  Some of my daughters, however, have thicker, stick straight hair and the curl doesn't last more than a few minutes in their hair so don't expect miracles from this iron if you have similar hair.",1
"This is the best foundation I have used; I love the way it blends in with my skin and the shade I found, ""brulee,""is perfect. The only discouraging
thing I've noticed about this foundation is that sometimes the foundation gets dark.  When I get towards 2/3 through the bottle, it seems to turn darker.",1
too thick,0
"Amazing hair mask. Leaves hair extremely soft, damage free.",1
Didnt work on my daughters head. Has a smell and dries really quickly.,0
My Revlon Double Twist base and top coat works way better than this for half the price.  Don't be fooled by the name brand.  Revlon may be so 90s but their nail products are pretty good.  The Revlon double twist base & top coat is my favorite.  Even better than IBD intense seal and I don't have to hold my hands under a UV light!,0
"It's nice but, it's Not what I thought it would be.",0
"I purchased this from my local salon; not from Amazon, and this is not the product that I remember. The fragrance is different; but more importantly the hold simply is no longer there. I began using this in the mid 1980's; and one round of spray held my hair all day, even in humid weather, it lived up to it's name, your style was frozen in place, no need to re-apply throughout the day. I just sprayed my hair, giving it time to dry, and I can run my fingers throughout, nothing ""Frozen"" in this product, it certainly doesn't live up to its name or reputation. Will not purchase again if doing so from a salon makes no difference, it's just good money wasted.",0
"This shaving cream works well, and you don't need much to get enough lather for 3+ passes (i only do 3).  The only critical thing i'd have to say, is that I don't really smell much sandalwood.  Also, it leaves a somewhat soapy scent on my face. I'm going to try a few other sandalwood shaving creams to see if there is a difference.",1
"After owning this item and using it a few times I am convinced that this is a fake, I would suggest that anyone that wants to purchase this iron buy it straight from the manufacturer.

Reading the reviews I am sure that it is hit or miss on receiving the real item.",0
"Doesn't sting, burn, or dry out my eyes! I have really sensitive eyes (I have to wear hypoallergenic mascara or my eyes turn really red) and this goes on my waterline, stays in place, and doesn't irritate my eyes at all.",1
I used it as toner and smells very good.,1
"Product is good, container it comes in is terrible. It's a hard plastic square container with lid that easily broke with shipping.  The company needs to find a better way to send product.",0
"After using a hair treatment from a different brand my scalp began to deteriorate. I started to experience itchiness and redness up to the point that I couldn't stop scratching, my hair got extremely greasy and I had to wash it every day just the experience half a day of relief. After using this shampoo (and obviously after getting rid of the other treatment) the alleviation was almost immediate, the itchiness and the redness ceased and I now have a healthy scalp just like I used to. Therefore I highly recommend this product to anyone struggling with the same situation, but not without mentioning the following: the shampoo dried my hair dramatically the first few days so be careful if you already have dry hair.",1
"if your baby has dry skin it won't help. I used if on my LO during the winter and had to switch to Burt's Bee which is thicker and non greasy. Mustela is more liquid. I decided instead of throwing it away to use it on myself and did nothing for my skin, same as my baby. I now use Burt's Bees baby for both of us and love it. It is the fourth bottle I just bought.",0
It was thin like water......not at all as described,0
"I have been so unhappy with this iron.  I bought one in August 2015 and it burned out in Oct 2015, Amazon replaced it but now it us Feb and the 2nd one burned out.  Very disappointed.  Hot Tools must have changed because the one I had before all these issues lasted for a few years and I had loved that one.",0
not worth the money,0
"This product STRIPPED all the nutrients out of my hair leaving it dull, frizzy, and weak.  My hair looked like a horrible wig after using the product.  I tried everything from olive oil and honey to eggs and hydrolyzed protein to get my hair back but it was not getting any better. Using this product was the worst mistake I have ever made in my entire life. My sister was shocked to see the result as well.  I am scared to go outside and meet people like this. I am warning you with my whole heart that this will permanently damage your hair and soul. Do not believe the positive reviews.. This product does not even deserve one star.",0
Perfect,1
I don't understand what the hype is. This thing is terrible and i have pinched my eyelid with it so many times.,0
Wonderful product for fine hair!,1
Love these lip glosses. Usually hate gloss as I find them sticky but these are amazing!!,1
great,1
I ordered this because I have the mini travel version and am always amazed at how fast it dries my hair and what great quality the dryer is.  I'm a big believe in quality - make the investment in the product,1
This stuff is great. My stylist recommended it for my bleached and colored hair. It helps a lot.,1
"Such a rip off! I received a half empty bottle with a ""free gift"" sticker on it. Like really?! It seriously looks like it was a free sample and was USED!!!! I'm terribly annoyed and can't believe I paid almost $8 for NOTHING. And it's not returnable.",0
"As I've said before I must have tried over 30 different soaps, creams and sticks from most expensive to cheapest. Have tried this puppy for over a week and consider it a top tier product in terms of comfort, glide, closeness and how it leaves your skin. Fragrance is mild and dissipates quickly. Lathers well, if you don't use too much water. Why only 4 stars? Because it is not the best. I'm almost coming to the conclusion that there is no one ""best"" shaving product. My top tier includes Proraso cream and tub, TOBS Jermyn St., VanDerHagen Luxury, AOS, but my 2 favorites remain Cella tub and Kiss My Face lime. But they are all very good. I might give the last two 5 stars while the other ones 4.9. Others that I might give a 4.8 would include Bigelow(by Proraso) Trufitt&Hill,and VanDerHagen Deluxe, Disappointing were Trumper, Arko, Speicer(?) Old Spice, and everything else.",1
This is not the authentic Jimmy choo it's very watered down as soon as you spray the scent disappears. I am so dis-satisfied and disappointed with this product expected better,0
This stuff is liquid gold LITERALY. Love it. Goes on non streaky and gives you that warm JALO WARM LOOK!,1
I found it left a slight tint but the smell is awful! After really washing I can still smell it and it almost smells like something rotting,0
"This review is for the full size shaving kit.  It comes in a nice box that opens and closes by unfolding the box.  It is nice packaging and would also make a nice presentation for a gift.

I haven't used a shaving brush in a long time.  I was using cheap shaving soap years ago from a drugstore with a shaving brush and switched to Edge Gel and never looked back.  However, since this was an all inclusive set, I decided to give it another shot.  Over the past several years, my shaving ritual includes shaving in the shower with Edge Gel and a Mach 3 razor.  I have tough beard, so I also followed up by running an electric razor over my face to get closer to my skin.  It worked okay, but it wasn't ideal because my neck has sensitive skin and it would often make my skin red and agitated.

To test this kit, I held off shaving for a few days.  I started the process by applying the Pre-Shave Oil.  While it is unscented, you can smell the cloves and pepper used in the ingredients.  I left that on for a few minutes and got in the shower.  I dipped the ""Black Pure Shaving Brush"" into the unscented shaving cream and brushed in on.  I then used the Mach 3 razor (not included) to easily glide through the three day beard.  It was a much cleaner shave than I have been used to, even compared to shaving with just a day in between shaves. It was pretty amazing.

After I wrapped up, I decided to run the electric shaver through any stubble left behind.  Unlike the usual cutting/buzzing sound I have gotten with my old shaving setup, I could only hear the blades spin, but I never heard that buzzing sound you get when the razors meet stubble.  My face was already smooth.

I then added their After Shave Balm.  My face felt moisturized, clean, and soft.  In short, this was the best shave I have ever had.  As a result, I am permanently changing my routing to include ""The Art of Shaving"" products.",1
Terrible! Keeps falling aoff de hair dryer.,0
"Overpriced,and I could not smell a thing",0
Love the product have been using it for years but my god with amazon and the shipping lately. 10 days later and I still don't have my order!!!,0
"Okay well my mom bought me this curling iron and it came a day before Christmas, which was cool because I thought ""sweet i can curl my hair for christmas!"" I have thickish hair, about 4 inches past my shoulders more or less, and its naturally wavy and sort of gets frizzy after a shower. I figured I could use this curling iron to shape up my waves after a shower so they look polished and sleek. Well unfortunately this was absolutely NOT what I was expecting. When I tried curling my hair I had to turn it up waaay high because anything lower than about 360 just made my hair straight with a rlly ugly flip at the end. So i realized i had to hold this thing to my head for at least a minute if not more to get a curl. And another thing - the curl doesn't look good! It gets a crimp mark where the curl begins on your head, and its shapen all wrong and tight-looking.  Not to mention it gets real boring sitting there holding this monster 5 pound piece of metal-ceramic whatever waiting for a curl that burns the side of your neck and looks like some uptight rope attatched to your head. This thing can barely even straighten right, which is pretty sad. I don't know if the other reviewers just got lucky with theirs or I just got the malfunctioned one but I wouldn't recommend this curling iron to my worst enemy. I've tried using this multiple times and even my friends have tried but it is not working, it didn't work for them either. Except my one friend who got her bangs to look real nice with it, I'm very disappointed with the outcome.",0
I was shopping around for a good shaving cream to go with the double edge saftey razor I started using. I used two other creams before this one and this is the best I've found so far. I like the classic look and feel of the tube. The lather leaves a tingling feeling and my face feels very smooth.,1
love this! works really well,1
Does not work,0
Just as it says.  Lasts about a week but not flawlessly.  It starts to chip after about four days and by seven days it's a mess.  Still worth it.,1
Really strips the hair of natural oils.,0
Not the best CND Shellac color coating... Color did not go on nail very nice. I could definitely see paint streaks once cured,0
Excellent. Heats up superfast. Worth the money.,1
This product is not the same strength as the product I previously purchased at a retail store. It was a very big disappointment. The seller was very understanding about my complaint and gave me a refund and prepaid freight to return it.,0
"Nothing better but use it regularly layer and throw all your other stuff out so you won't be tempted to use garbage anymore, this is the real deal baby!",1
"OK, I don't know what is going on with other reviewers.  It may be that this is primarily my #1 cheek stain, not lip stain, but I am in love with Stila Crush in Cherry.

I use it on my cheeks as my blush, and it gives me the most glorious, natural glow.  There is none of the 'too obvious' glitter, it absorbs so it does not appear to be lying on top of my cheeks, and I can even put a little stripe down my nose and blend it for the perfect flush.

I do use it on my lips.  But I put gloss over top because this is a stain, not a gloss.

My only complaint is the brush.  I only use it on my nose and lips.  When I put the stain on my cheeks, I apply it with my fingers.  Three clicks and it's the perfect amount for one cheek.

This is my fourth purchase of this product.  I hardly ever last past two!",1
"The names of the colors don't seem to match the actual color received. My color ordered was shattered souls and should have been a silver and black glitter but the actual color received was gold glitter. That wasn't all that uniform in application.
But the packaging was nice. The cap had a finger depression that made opening it much easier!",1
"Good price for my favorite hair spray
Easy to comb out and holds well with some flexibility",1
Couldn't get past the smell....,0
"I saw virtually no difference from adding this peel to my regular skin care routine. Even if it replaced the entire kit & caboodle,  it would still be way more expensive than what I do now.

PROS
- Didn't sting or overly rough-up my skin
- No odor

CONS
- NOT for rosacea-troubled skin! The AHA ingredient will wreak havoc on your skin if you use it in a rosacea area (e.g., nose, cheeks).
- After a week I didn't notice much difference.
- Expensive

ABOUT ME
I am in my 40s with very few lines around my eyes and none on my forehead or mouth area. I also have rosacea and extremely sensitive skin.

MY REGULAR ROUTINE
My routine gives me soft, firm skin that glows and has very few rosacea breakouts. It also reduces the fine lines around my eyes. The total cost of it is $55 and it lasts about 1.5 months. I didn't feel that adding the StriVectin Glycolic Peel (at $85!) produced any further improvement over what I already do.

Morning
- Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Scrub ($7.50 - lasts 1.5 months)
- Olay Total Effects 7 In One Moisturizer + Serum Duo With Sunscreen ($18.50 - lasts about 1 month)

Night
- Olay Regenerist microexfoliating cloths ($16 - lasts about 1 month)
- Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Night Firming Treatment ($13 - lasts 3 months)",0
The smell is nice but doesn't last as long as I think it should.,1
"I don't understand...I read the reviews, the claims....and this was not supposed to make my hair crunchy....but it does.
I can get crunchy hair for $5 at the drug store on some cheap brand mouse.  I'm disappointed.... To spend $32 and end up with 1980 stiff, crunch hair is not good.  I bought ""Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner"" and now have the soft beachy hair I wanted.  Don't buy this, it's a lot if money for nothing....unless you really miss the '80s",0
I love this toothpaste it really works to whiten your teeth! I definitely notice a difference when I use it.,1
The bristles got so hot I couldn't wrap my hair around the brush.  I kept burning my hand.  Had to return it.,0
"So very disappointed w/this pen corrector. Definitely does NOT meet high standards I've come to expect w/OPI. You only receive two tips and can't purchase additional tips! Really, OPI? The tips don't last past two polishings and that's if I'm lucky. Will look elsewhere.",0
"LOVE THE FRAGRANCE, TOO BAD IT DOES NOT LAST VERY LONG",1
Perfect! Tks,1
"This liner is a joke, I can't get the brown out and I just gave up.... It's now in the trash... Don't wa your money",0
smells like roses and feels great ,1
Just got it so not completely sure about result timeline it guarantees but it's very easy to use and I'm hoping it'll give great results.,1
"I got this product as a sample in my Birchbox. It feels very velvety going on and smells delicious, but I had to use quite a bit to get what I thought was decent coverage (which means it won't last very long for how much it costs!). It didn't feel moisturizing at all, really. I wore makeup as usual, and washed my face at the end of the day as usual. The next morning, I was broke out. Several very annoying zits on my nose and forehead. I am in my early 20s, so the occasional breakout still happens, but I believe this to be no coincidence. I'm glad it was free, because there's no way I'd pay for this stuff.",0
It's expensive for such a small bottle and I had to use twice as much product to get mediocre results.  I really could never get all my mascara off with just the Klorane remover. I prefer the makeup removers by Sonia K and Philosophy. Both remove all my eye makep and both are priced better. Klorane does not sting the eyes at all and safe for contact users.,0
This makeup is very light and east to apply. The color is good for me and does not look so much like I have makeup on. Best for summer wear.,1
One of my favorite body washes.,1
"Did not conceal my dark circles at all, no matter how much I applied.  And when I applied my finishing powder to my face as I usually do after my liquid foundation, it left my under eyes looking very wrinkled.  Also did not like the opalescent quality.",0
My cheap straight iron works better and you don't have to remember which way to hold it.  The curl looked OK at first but my hair was straight within an hour.  The curl from my flat iron lasts all day.,0
"I always try out products before I let the pre-teenagers any where near them.  I was glad it was me instead of one of the children when my face turned RED.  What was THAT about?  So red, but it didn't hurt.  I would also say that y skin feels smoother after using it.  However, my skin tone is already great to start with.  I am very lucky.  (The key for me is to never wear makeup other than a little mascara and lipstick.)  (Just try telling a 15 year old goth that.)

Our pre teen was prepared to see his skin turn red.  He said it was more like a 'light' red.

Use a very small amount.  It goes a long way.",1
I wish I could rate this item - I never did receive it in my package.,0
I used this in conjunction with the tummy oil and made it through a whole pregnancy without any stretchmarks. A tub lasted a little less than a month (used twice a day).,1
No tingle but works well.  Leaves my hair a little dry.,1
Wow .. i REALLY expected better but this liner smudged almost immediately and i do not have oily skin just the opposite. So not worth the price plus it did irritate my eyes.,0
"SUPER disappointed that I paid almost $8 for a teeny bottle of Elmer's Glue.  I expected more from an OPI product, until I read another customer review stating she felt the product was not authentic.  If this is the actual OPI product, save your money and raid your kid's school supplies.",0
"This appears to be a fake.  I used it 2 times !!  It stopped working and would not re-charge.  I compared the boxes & product to the one my daughter purchased at a store, the box and product are different.",0
I usually love stila however this product is lighter than others I have purchased of the same color. Truly disappointed.,0
"Ahhh, smells heavenly.  Thanks for quick service.",1
"This works wonders!  I bought all of the products that go with it, followed the directions to the T.  My clients hair broke off where we had used different chemicals before finding this product that a salon had used on her previously.

We worked with it.  Thought it was from the old product but she was still happy because her hair was pin straight.

We used it a second time, no overlap.  It broke off AT the point of application this time with no previous chemical overlapping.  I'm devastated that I've destroyed her hair and we have to start from scratch.",0
Purchased as a gift for my boyfriend. It has become both of our favorite men's cologne. And the price is pretty good for something of this quality. I recommend for sure.,1
I like it but very expensive and other comparable products available.,1
"i have really thin hair. Not thinning as in balding, just very fine textures hair. I always have hates regular gels that look like my hair is wet and then dry solid. I wanted to a look that made my hair feel like it had a decent amount of body to it. This lets me comb or position my hair where it needs to be but while keeping it dry.

The reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that because this is literally a wax, the grease from my head sits on top of it and doesn't absorb into my hair, so if I exclusively use this as my styling gel, then my hair looks really greasy at the end of the day. Greasy like homeless person. So I apply a little bit up front and the little bottle I've had for 2 years now is still 3/4 of the way full. This stuff lasts forever like that.",1
"I have also purchased this product, not from Amazon though, and had similar results as other reviews. It left my hair sticky and feeling like straw and completely unmanageable. It now resides in my cabinet with other products in which I have found have the same outcome and I will no longer use.",0
"This stuff is great and definitely helps clear up zits when used as directed. The earlier you detect a pimple forming and put this stuff on it, the more likely it will go away before coming to a head. It seems to even help reduce popped zits (I know I shouldn't, I just can't help it sometimes) in terms of swelling and redness. Even cystic acne goes away. I also use a thin layer on areas that I feel may break out (like freshly tweezed brows) and it is great for prevention.

I docked a star for the frustrating package it comes in. If the bottle was a little wider and shorter it would be perfect. When you get to the bottom of the bottle, you can't really reach it with a regular sized felt-tipped swab, for one thing, and for another usually the alcohol will completely dry out before you even get to the stuff so it dries into powder (I have gone through two bottles already). The last of the product is wasted unless you add a little of your own alcohol to the bottle and dig a cotton swab in there, covering your fingers in the residue at the top.",1
Great lip lube!,1
"Well worth the price, as I know my wife scrapes the bottle to reach the last dollop of Crabtree & Evelyn hand cream. She keeps one in her car and one on her desk. Gifts are easy when you know she enjoys Crabtree & Evelyn products so much.",1
Great product!,1
"love the smell!!! I can feel a difference in my hair as soon as i put it in, definitely recommend. Im a male with short to medium hair and colored so this definitely helps",1
"This has always been my scent of choice.  When recently moving to another state, a 3.3 oz. bottle has been missing, though I tried to keep watch over it at all times.  So I just had to get another from this seller at a good price.  It could be my imagination, but it seems the scent does not stay with me as long.  For many years, the scent remained until next day and received tons of compliments.",1
Onesta not only changed the packaging they also changed the formula... I used this volumizing foam for about 7-8 years and now it's a disaster... The foam leaves my hair sticky and flat. Absolutely dissatisfied with this updated product...,0
The product is ok though not worth the price. The packaging is awful. These little tiny containers don't open easily. I use scissors to open each one. Then you squeeze to release the product but it's pretty tough plastic. Really they couldn't find a better way?  Product is an oil but it absorbs well. I won't be buying again.,0
"I love this brand, am a big fan of The Balm. I didn't like the Opulent Body Butter as much - very thick and the scent was not as good as other products in this line. Did not finish the tube I bought and won't buy this again.

I do highly recommend The Balm.",0
on time...in package as photo shows...good product...helps prevent chips,1
great,1
"too expensive for the quantity.
I like the ease  of use and the gentle smell.
seem to help our baby's cheeks to gain back moisture",1
Hair was hard to comb and the smell is like grandmas hair.,0
"Been using this for like a week or so now. No complaints...I got both the cleansing cream and the toner. I spray the toner on my face and use cotton balls to clean my face, lips, neck and back of my ear. I could see the dirts come off so I guess it works. However, I haven't seen any ""toning"" happening but I will give it more time. In essence, I like it. On the other hand, this is my first toner so I'm not certain if toners typically do more than what Boscia does.",1
"Update:  Used 1/3rd of bottle and noticed it no longer provided a clean smelling body!  Changed to Neutrogena.  Original:  Looked for a replacement anti-bacterial soap since Cetaphil was no longer available.  From Bioderma Atoderm's description, I was hopeful that my skin would be amenable - it is and works.  However, I am hopeful that this manufacturer is able to discover a scent that is also amenable!",0
"The Havana candle with it's heady, thick, romantic, sensual, scent is not this candle. I have purchased this candle elsewhere many times in different shops and even travel to a shop in St. Augustine, Florida to buy it in the fall because it's the only store near me that sells it and they only purchase it in the cooler months I found out because it ships from overseas and tends to melt. I was very disappointed. While the candle has a heady scent, it's not the luscious, rich scent I am used to with this brand and fragrance. I don't know why it's different or off if you will, I just know that it is, more pungent that heady and will not be buying this candle online ever again I will stick to finding it in stores that I frequent. It did arrive timely, no damage to the contents. Maybe it was just old..? It didn't last very long either. Maybe a week if even. So not worth it.",0
"It doesn't seem to matter who you buy this from. It works well the first time you use it and then it's like there is no product left in the tube. It says to shake it and I have tried that repeatedly, it doesn't help! I bought 2 from Amazon, thinking the first one I got was a dud, (like the other reviewer). Then I got a replacement for that one and the same thing. So I decided to go buy one from Sephora and guess what? It's the SAME! Grrr...... Nice product, Good Concept. Too bad you can only use it ONCE!",0
This product did not stay in place. It was messy and did not cover the smallest patch!,0
great,1
Love the feeling of the shampoo. Gives me a nice tingling feeling that my hair is clean. Though I had a hard time opening the product.,1
I followed the directions to a tee ~ this is the third brand I tried and it just does not work.  I'm so sad because I just want longer/fuller lashes.  I wish they would make a product that really works.  I used this for six weeks and saw NO DIFFERENCE.  I didn't experience any stinging at all with this product.,0
I already own the career palette so I use this to custom create my own travel palette. The tool that comes with the big palette makes it easy to remove/change out makeup.,1
I'm 27 & still dealing with acne as an adult. I've tried every product out there. I've recently changed my daily routine to EltaMD. I'm very happy how my skin feels!,1
"I previously suffered with ingrown hairs on the right side of my neck, even when shaving with the grain. Not only did I get ingrown hairs, but I was never able to shave closely due to irritation. Now I'm no longer getting those, and I can even get a smooth close shave by shaving against the grain as I used to do before my ingrown hair problem.

Of course, nothing is perfect, so here are a few things to note:

- The product is expensive (you probably already know that), but it will last a good while.

- If you've been suffering with ingrown hairs (and your skin is not too dark), you will most likely have some scarring left by the cuts you got shaving over the bumps or by using the tweezers to extract the hairs. You should notice the bumps disappearing soon, but not the scars. This may mislead you into thinking that the product is not working, since your skin still looks horrible. Keep preventing the ingrowns from reappearing with the product, and the scars should reduce overtime.

- It will leave some green residue when it dries, a few hours after applying. Sadly its somehow visible, to the point that people may notice and comment on it. I recommend applying the product right before going to bed, and washing your face and neck properly when you wake up to get rid of this residue.

- The product WILL sting when you apply it the same day you shave (like an alcoholic aftershave). Not a big deal for me.",1
"I have multiple Hot Tools curling irons and compared to this one and it seemed off. Cheaper plastic casing, the handle and whole product felt lighter in materials, and it didn't seem to curl my hair like my other HT products. Can't put my finger on it so I decided to return. If the price is not around $40 or $50 like in beauty stores (this one was around $25) then it's likely not the real deal.",0
"Nice cleanser but those of us with oily skin will need to rotate something else in around the cleanser - it seems to increase oil production, although the actual texture of skin seemed to improve.",1
Pretty Good ! I liked It :-),1
Very hard to apply.  Left a gel mess.,0
"Used the entire bottle.  Applied it every morning and night directly to age spots and saw no significant change.  Still have to use concealer on age spots, same as before I tried it.",0
Greasy,0
It's good at curling. At the same time I have to make sure I don't put to much of my hair on there at one time. I have got my hair caught up a couple of times.,1
"My wife bought this machine because it looked like a good buy, and after only a few uses it produced no suction whatsoever.  Returned it because it was still under warranty, and the same thing happened with the replacement machine.

I guess the only thing we got out of this purchase is to not trust hyped-up advertisement.

Otherwise, buying this machine was a complete waste of money and time.",0
"My dermatologist recommended this product for me, and this purchase was my second container.

I have very dark circles under my eyes at all times, and although this does not eliminate them, it does reduce them so I don't look like I have a black eye.

It also reduced the appearance of the fine ""smile"" lines around my eyes.  I like the texture of the cream, it soaks in quickly and works well under makeup.

Overall, I'm happy with the product.  If I am ever able to find a product that worked even better on my dark circles, I would switch.  At this time, this is the best I have found.",1
"I purchased this looking for a higher SPF sunscreen I could wear for running. I'm sorry to say I don't like it because it goes on really greasy and it gives off the dreaded ghostly white appearance I was looking to avoid. Also, it is not sweat proof. Personally I would not recommend this product especially at that price point.
I am still looking for a sunscreen that has titanium dioxide that is sweat proof and clear.",0
Great shampoo very high price for shampoo that's why only 4 stars.,1
Can't beat the scent and the moisturizing properties of this shampoo are wonderful. The only shampoo that really keeps curly-heads happy!,1
"Smells great, my husband loves this stuff",1
"I love this stuff! I can't afford to get my hair colored or hassle with doing it myself every 3 weeks and my roots grow out FAST. I have tried a variety of different root products (from sponge types, to mascara types, etc) - this is by far my favorite. Super easy and super quick to apply. Convenient enough to throw in my purse for quick touch ups. The color was accurate. I will definitely be purchasing again.",1
"I always try to find a clean mask, and finally I found this one.  Obviously, it shrinks the pores, and I feel my face is thoroughly cleaned after use. I really love this mask.",1
Greatest brush ever made! Now on my 4th have had them for years.,1
"No noticeable change.  Also, I got headaches soon after applying on several occasions.",0
"Love this blow dryer. It normally takes me an hour to dry my hair, but this has cut my time in half! Plus my hair is much softer",1
"This facial wash is really good to my skin. I definitely recommend it to everyone. I have a sensitive skin and this is very friendly to my skin. I would recommend to get a moisturizer with it though, especially on winter time.",1
This had one speed and temp - HOT and FAST.  You had no time to style and it felt like it was really damaging your hair.  Was not pleased at all.,0
"Simply a great highlighter. Not powdery, gives a nice finish. Its worth trying out I think everyone would like this on the cheek bones or eye lids. Brush is okay for a travel throw away type use, but I actually like it to throw on blush or contour in a hurry because it doesn't hold much on it so you can go to town lightening speed with out giving a damn about the brush, lol!",1
"I like this concealer as it is opaque enough to hide circles under one's eyes.  It's also good for creating the illusion of even toned skin.  It's easy to use and the pen format is quite user friendly.  The concealer does not need more than one application per day.

The only reason I'm rating this 4 instead of 5 stars is that it is a little too dark for my skin.",1
"I like the products but  having to purchase  EVERYTHING you need to use to see results is extremely expensive for we non Hollywood ordinarily women plus to achieve results you really need to use quite a bit.

On to the next line of products.

 Perhaps you should do a full-size kit at a decent price.",0
Nothing like the EDP.,0
"Do NOT buy this!
Doesn't work at all",0
"I originally wrote back in 2010 that this gel was a good clean, clear, lightweight gel that worked as good as my previous doctor's prescription and it was. BUT today in Feb 2013 about 2wks ago (after not having had to buy any for a whole lot of months) I bought a new tube and all those recent reviews are right, something has changed in the formula. I was hesitant to order seeing the new reviews, but it had been so effective for me before that I had to give the new formula a try.  As a young adult I get mostly spotty breakouts (1-3 bumps at a time).  This gel used to take care of those bumps within 24 to 48 hours or less.  I had a breakout about a week ago that actually seems to have gotten larger and worse after a whole week of treatment with the new gel:rather than disappearing in a day or two like before--it's having no effect, except irritation enlarging the bumps and drying out my skin around them.  Also the cream is thicker, it can be rubbed in but later peels off, especially if applied under sunscreen, lotion, etc.  I'm very disappointed to have lost this gel, now I'm back to square one again and good skin products are so hard to find.",0
"Not really that good, better products on the market, and for a better price",0
"effective but way, way too expensive!",1
Doesn't work well at all. Maybe i'm applying it wrong?,0
"I LOVE the LONDON Butter line and have several colors. I ordered this one with the hopes that it would have a purple shade to it like in the picture but it goes a muted, silver, kind of sparkly, pale color. Not impressed with this color.",0
"Got this for my husband and he is very happy with the products. The shampoo smells great and the conditioner certainly hydrates his beard but it's not doing a great job at styling it. My husband enjoys the brush too, says it works very well for him. I was expecting that these products would help tame his beard a little better so that's why i'm giving them 4 stars.",1
"When I've used this product in the past, the shampoo was a dark brown liquid, almost a henna color. I loved that shampoo and it added good volume to my fine hair.
This time the shampoo is a honey color and I'm not sure why. I've shaken and shaken the bottle in case of settling but the color hasn't changed. I don't know if the formula changed or if it's an old bottle. Regardless I'm disappointed and not certain if I should use it or not.",0
This is a very poorly made product; the container broke after 3 weeks making it impossible to use the contents; inexcusable at a price of over $100! Would not recommend this cream to anyone.,0
"Like the other 1 star review, I received this shampoo and it is NOT the same. I've used this shampoo for years and this is not the same smell or consistency. I thought maybe it had settled because I couldn't imagine a seller sending false product, so I shook it and used it for a bit. Finally, after a few months, my hair was in TERRIBLE condition. My hairdresser noticed the changed and asked me if I had switched shampoo. I said no and we were both puzzled until she asked where I bought my last bottle. When I told her, she immediately asked to see the bottle, I brought it to her and we compared and it is 100% not Sebastian shampoo. I'm not as upset about the loss of money as I am the quality of my hair. Very upsetting.",0
"Either the product I received is not legit, or this is a terrible product. It's incredibly sticky and even after vigorous rinsing leaves my hair in sticky ropes.",0
Makes my hair sticky!,0
It was okay to me nothing special. The only problem is that I'm african american and this sunblock made me ghostly I was literally white.,0
I've only been using it for a couple of weeks but definitely see an improvement in firmness.  Need more time to acess an accurate rating. But currently after only two weeks of therapy I would give it a,1
This blow dryer smells like something is burning up inside it. I had to quit using it. It seems to overheat.  I haven't had it but a couple of weeks. I need to return it. How do I do that? I am very disappointed in this blow dryer.,0
I LOVE this toner.  It gets my face really clean and it's gentle on my skin.  Highly recommend it.,1
pocket comb too small,0
working on discoloration and wrinkles on my neck.,1
Glad my husband found this item on Amazon and presented me with one of my favorite scents for Valentine's Day.,1
"This product just didn't do it for me. It may work for other people, but for me it just couldn't hold my hair back, and I have pretty thin clean hair. Not saying don't buy it. And I hated the smell of this stuff, smelled super gross.",0
"I've tried at least a dozen dandruff shampoos, ranging from gross smelling (like T-Gel), mild (head and shoulders, some herbal brands ), and allergy friendly (Free and Clear, numerous Sulfate-free brands). Some dried out my hair and scalp, some left me with hives, some caused a psoriasis spot .... If I found something that fixed one problem it seemed to add a new one. I was so frustrated and embarrassed!! Finally my hairstylist friend told me about Davines and suggested I use this shampoo with the Momo conditioner. It took 2-3 washes, but I haven't had a psoriasis flair up, hives, or dry scalp since. It might sound overly dramatic, but this has made a HUGE difference in my life! And the combination of shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair looking (and smelling) amazing. I wish I found these products 2 years ago. Highly recommend!",1
"Those of us for whom this is important, this product contains parabens. The ingredients are not listed by the seller and I bought it without doing my research. I like to stay away from parabens and sulfates when it comes to direct contact with my skin.",0
"Sadly I can't jump on the bandwagon of loving this stuff.  It broke me out on the first use.  I'm sure it's great for some, but sensitive peeps proceed with caution.",0
"The candle does not burn well at all. It seems to be very old stock...maybe? It's having a hard time keeping the flame up, then it starts tunneling.  I burned it all night trying to get it to even out, had to wrap foil around it & then it melted evenly. Who wants to have a foil wrapped candle? Nobody. I do like the smell, good piney scent but just does not burn well at all, too much trouble. Don't think I will ever get another Lafco candle, although I do love their soaps.",0
too itchy,0
I just spend my money very bad product,0
"I was looking for something to replace my old antiperspirant when I came across the MenScience brand - strangely I had never seen or heard of it but it seemed to get great reviews. The short version is that this will be my new brand. It is about 4x the cost of my old deoderant/antiperspirant but to me its woth the cost and works well. It does not have a smell as labeled, or at least not that I can smell. I've been using it over a month now and I will continue to from now on.",1
Works great! and it is literally the BEST SCENT EVER!!!!!! The smell is amazing.,1
In person it's different then pic,0
The product was really dry and did not blend well. Its also REALLY light. I have fair skin and it gives me reverse raccoon eyes.,0
This was not the real olaplex!,0
Beware! This is a complete fake.,0
I was using this product before and now I get a new order but the product wasn't good it was just a little bit or the cream and the rest inside on the tube was water I don't know why this product is like that maybe is imitation or just fraud I am totally disappointed with this because it's not cheap it's a little bit expensive I don't know if the company or what it is I want a explanation about this thank you,0
I don't like it,0
did not last long,0
It only takes a very small amount to add shine.  The best prices item for hair products!,1
rated zero all spilled out in box.,0
"This polish coats smoothly and evenly.  It dries well and doesn't seem to chip easily. The color isn't exactly my cup of tea, but if you are into purple, you will like it.",1
"It's ok if you have blonde or light colored hair. I had to pass it along to my friend who has blonde hair. I used it in my brunette mane and it gave me nothing but a chalky look. I started it to then use it right after blow drying my hair just to had a little bit of oomph- that's the only time I saw the benefit of it. It is not meant for dark hair, especially if you are trying to use it as an oil absorbant.",0
"Good word for this product, once your I to the system, this does make you feel like it is rehydrating the skin",1
Doesn't last long for that piece.,0
I would prefer not to give any stars for this product.  It does not work.  I will continue to get this name brand product from QVS in the packages as they actually work and do what the product claims.,0
"I bought this to use on my daughter's hair - it has a lovely rose smell and does a wonderful job moisturizing her very dry hair.  I sectioned her hair and rubbed some on her scalp, as well as along her hair.  It immediately was absorbed and left her very coarse, 4C textured hair nice and soft.  Sooooo much better than the stuff you buy in the corner beauty store.",1
"My blow drier no longer works correctly. It won't get warm at all, only cold air. I haven't even had it a year yet. Too much money for a faulty product.",0
I was so excited to get this because mine had wore out. I opened it  and threw away the packaging. A couple of days later I set down to use it a but  The red light stayed on other light just blinked. I tried it several times. finally I threw it way.,0
"I am sad to report that I purchased this product and it made my acne soooo much worse. I had 3 very small acne lesions and they increased 10 times in size and they got infected!! YES, INFECTED!!!!! I used a very small amount (spot treated) and used only as directed on 3 seperate occassions and I could not believe what this product did to my skin. It was so bad that I've been to my estisican 3 times this week and it's still not 100 percent clear yet. Also, buyer beware, not all the ingrediants are listed on their website, so if you choose to buy this product, be sure you look at all the ingrediants once you receive it. I've also tried to return the product and they won't take it back...I will never buy any products from this company again and will be sure to spead the word to others about it..This product does not even deserve one star, but I had no choice, I had to rate it...BEWARE, I am an acne suffer and I truely thought this was going to be a good product and I am warning everyone, please look for a different product, don't let their ad convince you otherwise, it's no good nor is their customer service.",0
This product is terrible. Requires months worth of treatments just to get results. I would suggest getting professional laser hair removal instead of buying this over-priced piece of garbage.,0
"This in my opinion is the hands down best conditioner out on the market today! I found his by chance getting my hair down at a salon with a groupon sale and the salon used only Unite products. I have thick hair and a lot of it. I color my hair and have a thyroid problem so it's always on the dry side. I have a wet brush to get a brush through it after I wash it because it tangles and is just a mess. I've found since I started using this conditioner, it makes my hair so soft and so easy to work with that brushing is no longer a chore and it smells nice and clean. It have a very soft scent and does not make my hair greasy. I also must have the 7 seconds leave in conditioner/de-tangling spray. The combo of both these products give my hair new life and the results are salon like.. literally! It is pricey yes but the quality of the product will make you fall in love with your hair again .. if you are like me with dry, tangled thick hair that is a job in itself to wash and style. They both also have a heat protector in them so drying with a ceramic brush or hot iron will not damage your hair.",1
Love this product,1
This is truly an excellent product.  Hair is exceptional with shine.  Use only small amount,1
"This item rusted after 2 months, it looks 10yrs old. Horrible product.",0
"But no matter how gently I try to remove it, (I have a very good high end make-up remover) I always loose a few eyelashes. I will be throwingthis one away.",0
It smells great and I was very impressed.,1
"I had previously bought this product from another seller on Amazon last year and it was great. However, this one is TOTALLY different. I bought these new bottles a few months ago and felt I should leave a review here since I'm extremely disappointed. It smells and feels like the cheap stuff you get at stores (that cheap strawberry stuff). The first time I bought it, it came boxed up in Paul Mitchell packaging, didn't have much of a smell to it other than the typical PM smell, and was soft, even if you put a lot on. When I bought them from this seller they came shrink-wrapped in plastic not boxed up (which is making me think it was counterfeit but who knows). And it feels like a ton of build up when you put it on (actually has a weird texture to it, like you're spraying on hair spray mixed with conditioner and water). I definitely wouldn't recommend this. Not sure what all of the other reviews for this are for, they can't be serious.",0
"Well it feels nice :) But I have very sensitive skin and it made me break out right away...first night. I wish I could use it...smells great, feels great...but pimples :)",0
I ordered this lipstick thinking that it was the color that's shown in the main photo box on amazon. The color I received was MUCH different than what is shown on amazon. Several shades darker and more of a plum color. Beware that this product is advertised much differently than what you might receive.,0
This cologne smells wonderful and is a great bargain.  It is $75.00 at the mall.,1
It helps but it's sticky and probably not the best product out there but best so far out of my searches within affordable prices.,1
Love this perfume,1
I RECOMMEND TO BUY IT IN A NORMAL STORE,0
"As someone with very fair skin, it can be hard to find a product to add a hint of color without looking orange and/or really fake. I tried using this on its own, and the color was a bit too dark and shimmery. After mixing with my regular foundation, it provides the perfect amount. It leaves behind a really nice glow that doesn't seem makeup-based. The consistency of this tint lotion is very silky and goes on without feeling sticky. The luminizing effect is wonderful for the summer months in lieu of tanning and damaging the skin. After using daily for two weeks I was pleased that I didn't experience any breakouts or other adverse skin reactions from adding this to my routine. I do wish it were more natural as I prefer to use products with fewer chemicals, but I've yet to find a good tinted luminizer from a more natural/organic line that doesn't come across as too glittery, too orange, or too skin irritating.",1
"This product is a great, but expensive, moisturizer.  A self-tanner it is NOT!  I've used the whole bottle, even dried off a bit first - just in case that was the issue.  Absolutely ZERO color.  Would not waste money on this product - so sad, since I had big hopes that this would work.  A great concept.  Boo!!",0
"Love it, it works beautifully on my fine hair. It helps me add volume and cuts down on the styling time.",1
"We have very rusty water. I use the packets about every three or four weeks. I don't bother with a lot of fussing around. In the past I would have wrapped my hair in plastic wrap, foil and a towel. Then laid on the floor in front of the heater. With this product, I just take a little longer shower. The conditioner is for for after the treatment only. Excellent value for your money!",1
Scent doesn't last very long and doesn't smell as good as the one I previously owned that was purchased at the mall. Very disappointed.,0
"This is a great way to experience some of the best colors Stila offers. Just keep in mind these are the smaller glazes .05 ounces  that sell for about 8.00 each, not 22 like the other reviewer noted. With that said, these make a really cute treat for yourself or a gift for an awesome friend, maybe a friend's daughter. Comes with a gold headband. Colors included:
 Glamour (sparkling ruby)
 Gleam (sparkling mauve)
 Glint (icy pink)
 Glow (sparkling champagne)
 Glitter (sparkling pink diamond)
 Glimmer (sparkling apricot)
 Glisten (sparkling sugarplum)
 Glory (blackberry)",1
"I love exploring new products to improve my skin. I wasn't sure what to expect with these gel patches, as most everything I've used has been a cream or serum. I opened one of the packets containing the forehead patch. The patch had a nice weight to it, and the backing peeled away easily for placement on my forehead.  it was quite large, so I chose to cut a bit off each side and use those extra pieces for the expression lines around my eyes. I then opened the packet containing the patches for the smile lines on either side of the mouth. These patches were also too large for me, but I placed them on each side of my face anyway, running from the nose, down below my lower lip. As I said, they were too large for me, but I made them work. Now it was time to relax.

Ahhhhhhh, a little quiet time. I rested while the patches worked their magic. The patches felt very cool against my skin, and there was a slight bubbling sensation, almost like the sizzling of a foam mousse as it disipates. I left the patches in place a little longer than the suggested 10 minutes, just because I felt very relaxed and didn't think it would hurt to leave them on a bit longer.

Ding! My time was up. The patches peeled off easily, without any pulling of my skin, or residue left behind. The areas treated by the patches looked smooth and relaxed, and the skin felt soft to the touch. The results were not long lasting, but I would imagine that with regular use over a couple of months, the results would be more noticeable and perhaps cumulative.

Overall, my experience was enjoyable, and I saw some nice, temporary results.",1
This shade is definitely not the same as the original OPI Hawaiian Orchid at all. The original was sheer with a hint of lilac. This is neither. Very disappointed.,0
"I loved this hairdryer when I first got it.  It cut the time to dry my long, thick hair by about 10 minutes, and my hair looked so much better.  It was shiny, smooth and didn't require much touching up with a flat iron.  However, now that I've had it for about two months, something has gone wrong with it.  The fan won't work at the highest speed when I use the highest heat setting (a must for my hair).  It's taking longer and frying my hair.  I'm now back on Amazon searching for a replacement.  I go through hair dryers pretty quickly, but two months is ridiculous.",0
"Was not sure what the purpose of Toner is - but bought it because it's part of the Cellex-C regimen that I'm using.  After using it for 60 days, still not sure what toner does.  I will continue to use the rest of my Cellex-C products (I love all of them), but won't waste my money on the Toner again.",0
2 Months no improvement,0
Love this product! Really keeps my eyeshadow on all day long.,1
Didn't see a change and made hair look messy.,0
"The reason I gave this 2 stars is because I used a friends before purchasing and I loved it!  The curl stays for 2-3 days and it was easy to use.  I broke my arm and have difficulty using my normal curling wand so I thought this purchase would be awesome.  The problem started with the left curl not working.  Then it wasn't feeding correctly and I would have to try 2-3 times for the hair to grab.  I quit using it after my hair literally got stuck in the iron, sizzling!!! I don't know how often this happens but I'm torn with getting a new one.  I loved my hair when using my friends and it's so hard doing my hair with my broken arm right now...ugh!",0
16 year old and like this item. Santa thanks!,1
Did absolutely nothing for my skin.,0
"I've used this for years! It works on my slightly curly, can-be-ugly, hair. I used to have to get this through a licensed beautician, but was so glad to find it on Amazon Prime.",1
"I had high hopes for this eyeliner, but was disappointed!  You may get one eye done but will have to wait a while before enough liquid loads on brush to do the other eye.  It is made of some substance that does not go on well.  For the cost of the eyeliner, I was not impressed!",0
I love this product and will continue ordering more. It keeps my hair in great condition and soft to touch.,1
"I have frizzy/curly hair and have been using Elchim blow dryers for over 20 years but I've noticed that the past several Elchim blowdryers that I've purchased are not what they used to be.  They don't have the same power, heat or last like they used to.  This one barely lasted 7 months. I purchased in August of 2016 and it's already broken, totally dead!  I am not ordering Elchim again after many tries.

"I've been using the tint balm from benefit for several years. However, I realized that the product doesn't get produced anymore and since then I've been looking for the replacement. Compare to the benefit, this has more artificial tone of color. BUT, the price of Korres lip butter is simply unbelievably cheap. From now on, I'm sticking with this lip tint!",1
This fragrance has a subtle lovely scent.,1
I haven't seen any quality changecwith this.  Like the plain oil much better.,0

There was no difference after several weeks of use. Recommend purchasing Hyaluronic Serum to use before applying your face moisturizer!!,0
I am a first time mama and i did not have any idea how annoying my feet can get. My feet were always on fire. This Mama mio product was a real help for my problem. I applied this product on my feet n it worked like charm. M in my 9th month pregnancy now. Been using it since my 2nd month of pregnancy. It has never failedme. It is a must have product for all pregnant women with burning feet.,1
Scents don't lasting,0
Disappointed with this brand.  Expected more of a full coverage from this creme but it is only a bit better coverage than their liquid foundation.  Not worth the price at all.,0
do yourself a favor,1
I am very satisfied with my curling iron. Great service also.,1
I lost my color within a week :( super disappointed,0
"I never leave a review , but if I can save you some money then it's worth the time it took to type this. This soap has a very strong odd smell to it. I understand everyone is different, but this is that exception. I can't believe anyone would like the smell of this soap. Do not waste your money!!!",0
"Red Light Therapy has been around a while. It was developed by NASA for use in space with astronauts. Apparently by accident, they discovered it rejuvenated skin around the areas they were using it for muscle soreness. With years of experience and knowledge in the medical/aesthetics field I am always skeptical. When, on a routine dermatologist visit the doctor noticed what turned out to be basel cell skin cancer. Naturally, I freaked. However, he assured me that if one was to get cancer of the skin this would be the variety one would want to get. (Didn't assure me) It was around the holidays so I put it off and decided that it certainly could not hurt to try red light therapy in the meanwhile, since, as the universe would have it I just received a Baby Quasar PLUS Therapy Device in a gift bag for a big Hollywood event. So, I figured ""why not""

I used it twice a day for 10 minutes or so held directly over the small lesion. Then, around my eyes. I didn't see anything right away and sort of forgot about it until two weeks later after New Years, the lesion had shrunk dramatically. I increased the time to almost 30 minutes a day. In 8 weeks the lesion was almost gone and my doctor was dumfounded. He, being of the medical mind, didn't want to give credit to a home device. But I knew better. I started using it on my entire face, but that got pretty time consuming so I found a spa in Beverly Hills that has stand up, full body ""Beauty Angel"" machines. 12 minutes full body. Every day. 4 weeks later, I was cured and the skin on my whole body was greatly improved and healthier looking. I go now 2-3 times a week and use the Baby Quasar at home on special problem areas.

Red Light really works, and I must give this product high marks. However, the downside is it is very time consuming and you have to be consistent with it or it is just a waste of time. My suggestion would be to find a spa and use this as an add-in for really noticeable results.

Finally, please note that my experience is not typical. If you suspect any type of cancer consult your doctor and never use a review such as this in lieu of medical advice. Ever. I am just very happy with my end point results, and hope this helps someone else.",1
"It smells great, and it very strong.  Not much is needed which saves the cologne for multiple uses.  Quick delivery.  Like!",1
Strange smell,0
"Although this color was touted as a darker shade, it was not. Looking to replace my old brand, which was Maybelline.",0
"Use daily to assist with am defecation.  Apply to abdomen and back, within 5-10 minutes works with results.",1
I first tried the Paul Mitchell Detangler at a Marriot Inn and loved how it made my hair feel really soft and smooth (my hair is very thick and very dry). However the Amazon Detangler is obviously a FAKE. it doesn't smell nice and leaves my hair just as dry as before. Really disappointed in Amazon for selling a fake product. BUY FROM A SALON.,0
Does not wear/last well.  Not as described in the reviews. Disappointed.,0
Very good all around fragrance smell that you can wear on all occassion from the office to a night spot gathering with a friend or a few more.,1
I like it better than the Moroccan oil. I love the pretty scent! However it's not a necessity product for me. I will do just fine without it once I run out. I actually don't use it everyday. I only use when I go out and need to style my hair.,1
I truly enjoy this product.  It has done wonders for my hair.  I love the idea of having it delivered to my doorstep!,1
Nice clear base coat.,1
"I have been using Longcils Boncza cake mascara in brown for many years, but it didn't look good with the navy blue eyeliner I've been into lately. I wanted to try a different brand in black, so I bought the MadLash mascara. It's a lovely black that stays on all day. It doesn't easily smudge, but is a real bitch to get off. I use my olive and castor cleansing oil and I still have to 'scrub' a bit. I'd rather have that than smeary makeup though, so it's a trade off. I find that it's a bit clumpy, and I read that adding a couple drops of saline solution (eye drops) would help out, so I will give that a try and see if it helps. ***UPDATE**** The saline solution did help with clumps, as well as running a dry spoolie through my lashes after application.",1
It lasts longer on the nail,1
When buying I didn't realize you use every 5 washes. It does work I just have fine hair so for me and my hair it's a little strong. I've used less which helped. I live in the south with curly hair so I truly haven't found any product to work. If your hair is not fine and naturally very curly it would probably be great. Would be great for wavy or hard to control straight hair.,1
Need at least 3 coats to lose transparency. Nice color. Does cute with LED and UV lamp.,1
Not sure what the hype is about this product. It didn't give me the extra volume and I couldn't get over the strong floral scent,0
Very good lather and it will last you for an extremely long time!,1
"I love this hair dryer! I don't find it heavy at all, but it feels sturdy and very well-made - and it greatly reduces frizz.

I found many of these reviews to say that this dryer didn't work with many diffusers. I ordered the Babyliss CPD05 Conair Pro Interchangeable 3-in-1 Diffuser, and it works perfectly, and has never fallen off like the other reviews suggested.",1
"I bought this set to take on a trip to Europe. They're somewhat higher quality than your standard items, so they cost a bit more. Probably a tad overpriced but it may be difficult to find something that competes in terms of quality at the price point.",1
Completely stripped the gray from my hair and left it blonde. Just terrible,0
Didn't do anything for me.,0
I was not impressed.  It doesn't dry quickly so had issues with it appearing under my eyes.  It doesn't look any more special than a much cheaper mascara.,0
"Loved product!!!!  works perfect in my curly hair. Leaves it shinny,soft, hydrated and forms my curls to perfection",1
"it doesnt work, it smells terrible and it makes my hair knott up underneath and get frizzy on top. the smell was just something i couldn't handle even if it did work. yuck",0
"made my hair feel sticky like paste, sent back.",0
"Didn't like, it didn't amplify and the tube stuff is weird, I wear contacts and that really really irritates my eyes. Not so good, wore it a few time and will not be wearing it again.",0
"I had bought this product several times before and it was dark, long lasting, and easy to apply. Maybe I got a dud, but this purchase was very light in color and seemed to run out in a few weeks. When I first bought the product, the line was very dark and precise. Now it comes out dull gray and fasdes in a few hours to nothing.",0
"The consistency is extremely rich. It didn't cause issues with my makeup. The product is definitely all natural.  I like the fact there are no chemicals. I rated 4 stars based on the smell. It isn't bad, it is just a combination of the natural products and has a scent that was oily smelling. I don't know how else to describe. If you want a natural product, it will smell like the ingredients and not artificial perfumes, of course. I just like other scents better.",1
"I wash my beard every two days with this wash and it dries it out every time. However, the scent is nice and it is easy to lather and rinse.",0
"Ok so at first I was not a fan and here's why: the polish seems dry but it's so soft that anything touching your nails with enough pressure will leave dents & marks. Also it came off with alcohol wipes even the day after application! Insane, I know. So I thought I would set it with a uv lamp & problem solved! It stays on for at least a week and is easy to take off w NPR but does stain the nails quite a bit. If that's not your cup of tea I suggest skipping it but overall much less curing w uv light (just once after top coat) & no soaking required to remove. FYI - The polish itself is not opaque after two coats, very solid color.",1
helps thin hair on top,1
This was a misleading discription; it absolutly does not fit my Babyliss blowdryer; now i need to return it; please make an adjustment so other customers do not get the same issue.,0
"1 inch too big for me. Reviews said 1"" was good for short-ish hair.  Curls are VERY LOOSE and don't last.  Not good enough for my hair.  Not returnable so be very sure this is the size you need.  :-(  I thought ALL Amazon Prime items were returnable so I didn't notice the little note that said it could not be returned.",0
"So my shaving section of the bathroom is all about Proraso.  Ever since I discovered the old school way of shaving with a single blade safety razor, cream that you whip up in a cup with a beaver fur brush...I will never go back to the endless money pit of the main brand razors.

That being said, this sensitive skin cream is not my favorite.  I enjoy their classic scent much more than this one, and I can't say as though I noticed any additional protection from the sensitive skin cream vs. classic.

Still a great product, just not my favorite from theirs.",1
"I was very disappointed! It was not smooth and hard and would break off when I tried to use it. Not like others I have ordered in other colors. Very bummed, because they are pricey.",0
Works great and smells heavenly,1
Not too great.,0
This Dryer is worth the money. My wife loves it and it dries her long hair fast.,1
The wife likes it.,1
"This looks really good over all my make up. I currently us bare minerals primer, make up forever water blend foundation, and tarte concealer. It doesn't ever looks cakey or wear off throughout my day.  It is an amazing highlight wirh just a little sparkle.",1
good quality.,1
"A good product. I tried to write a review on the Derma Doctor site. They wouldn't let me; so I am going to try to post a review on this site.  As I said above, the product is very good but here is the problem: The last time I received this, the jar was tiny! What use to last 3 months won't even last a month now. I have been using CCC for 7+ years. This last tiny jar had big air bubbles in it. I tried to write this on their site and they wouldn't post it. This makes me think they are only posting the reviews that give CCC a good rating.",0
"Solid soap. Not quite as slick as the Proraso green, but the white (I believe) is also mentholated, so you get the same refreshing feeling on the face. Whips up easily though it seems to dissipate after the second pass a little -- my technique is likely the thing to blame there. Nice soap I'm glad to have in the collection.",1
I do not think this shampoo/conditioner is real. The conditioner literally tangles my hair. I am extremely disappointed as I have never had this happen with any product from Amazon.,0
"Slightly overpowering at first but settles down to a lovely, subtle scent that has grown on me.",1
"I have always bought nice hair products to help with the frizz and to help straighten my wavy hair. Well there is no need to any of that. It's ALL about the hair dryer. OMG what a difference this hair dryer has made to my hair. I absolutely LOVE it! It makes my hair so shiny, NO static or frizz, dries my hair faster and leaves my hair feeling so silky! I bought this on an awesome sale. I think it was 68% off. So if you are on a budget. Click on link for this dryer and store it in your cart until it goes on sale or splurge and get it now!!!! You will save a small fortune on products that you would buy to do what this dryer does. They should rename this dryer WOW!!!!!! I honestly cannot say enough about it!",1
Not so mint! Feel not goid as toothpaste!,0
Works well,1
The bottle was empty.,0
Product was not sealed.,0
"While they heat. up quickly,I do not like the clips,leaves dents at root area,so I have to dampen and blo to get rid of it. I bought these for size which are good,and t save time in the am,but just does not work for me. I also have fine hair,maybe works better with thicker hair. Would send back if I just kept the darn box!",0
"I don't write a lot of reviews bot here it is. I bought it, tried it, and I feel dumb for buying a $20 dollar towel. Let me start by saying that this ""miraculous"" product did remove most of my make up, however, if I wet a towel it would do a very similar job as well.
The worst thing if with the eyes, you have to rub so much your eye and the under eye in order to wipe the mascara and eyeliner off. I felt so guilty with my eyes afterwards, and I couldn't even get all of my mascara, there were some residues under my eye which I didn't want to keep rubbing with a towel.
After using my make up eraser I used some make up remover just to make sure it removed all my make up and surprise! there were some residues in my skin... I mean the whole point of removing my make up is so I can go to bed without filth in my skin, other wise I start getting enlarged pores. I also have to use some coconut oil to remove the mascara residues.
I don't wear a lot of make up, just some light foundation and mascara, so for me this was the same as a towel. Maybe if you wear a lot of make up you can see a difference, I didn't.",0
Love it. Gets really hot and does a wonderful job .,1
Smells wonderful,1
Love this polish!!,1
"Sebastian crude clay was awesome. Craft clay is average, and everyone agrees, why on earth did they swap a great product for a useless product???

Luckily, finally I have found something that works just the same as crude clay, stiff miracle mud, amazing!",0
Great product but there's barely enough of it in the tube,1
not true to color in photo,0
Started loosing bristles almost immediately,0
"I found out about this product through a tutorial I found by mistake on youtube! SO glad I found this! It arrived in about 3 days & I tried it just last night. I didn't time the duration it took for everything to dry, but it was definitely under 10 minutes. I usually do my nails about 2 hours before I go to bed, but usually get those gross wrinkly marks from the sheets & from tossing around. I woke up this morning & my nails are wrinkle/smudge free & SO shiny!

Only complaint: the bottle leaked a little in the package :/ but I easily cleaned everything up with a paper towel. Left my hands feeling super soft :)",1
Awesome! If I had to pick one makeup product-this would be it. Only moisturizer I can use without breaking out,1
"I used Baxter's Hair Pomade for my hair (even though I'm a girl) and it worked for my hair. I have thick, thick hair and it kept the style throughout the day without me worrying about frizz. It's not exactly ""light"" to me, but this pomade does the job. The scent was mild, but not overwhelming, and perfect for a man. But, it also gets the job done if you're a girl too.",1
"gave it to my friend who loves tropical coconut fragrance. It leaves hair silky and smooth,nourished,smells good ,but triggered my migraine. Be aware if you are sensitive.",1
Very pleased,1
"I did try this, and it was okay on the hands, but couldn't get past the smell, put it in the Goodwill box.",0
I was very pleased with this curling iron. It heats up nicely and the temperature control really helps you regulate the heat on any type of hair. This is my second product that I purchased from Hot Tools and would recommend any of their products!,1
Such a lovely color.,1
"So much to pay for shampoo, but my hair does look better!",1
"First time ordering the Grande mascara and it will be my last.  Not sure if I received a bad batch.  But, the mascara is all clumpy and the brush does not apply it evenly.  My eyelashes clumped together immediately.  Not worth 1/2 what I paid for it.",0
"Terrible. Do no waste your time. The return policy is 30 days and on the instruction they want you to use it for few times first. Anyway, I called the company and told them I was not seen any results, they didn't want to hear it. I would of been happy if they gave me half money back.",0
Nice,1
Love the silky feeling that it leave s on my skin but I do not care for the scent.  Would reorder in a better scent.,1
"I am glad I ignored a negative review found here on Amazon about this product, because though it is somewhat sticky, it is ideal to put on before bed.  I felt instant relief when I put it on my elbows, and I constantly have been putting lotions on my elbows, and they are feeling like sandpaper.  So glad I found this product!",1
"Greasy, doesn't hold well, smells bad and makes my short non curly hair curl immediately after I put it in. Terrible.",0
"The product claims to be non irritating even for the most sensitive skin, but I experienced otherwise.
After using the serum about a week, I started to develop redness and irritation.
It's a very fluid product, easy to apply and invisible.",0
I was disappointed that my trio was not the one pictured. The lotion is awesome as always.,0
Cleans very well.  My skin feels amazing.  OOnly down side is that its takes about 5 minuts to scrub my face now.,1
The reviews were misleading! This product is full of perfumes and dyes. Be cautious of what you put on your skin! It broke mine out.,0
"Great product that actually does what it says it will. I am a new Zoya fan. It's less toxic, long lasting, and leaves my nails in better condition. A+",1
Ok but not amazing.,0
It was good but when you put it on it gives a white film on your face and feels little shiny. I am not sure if it blocks the sun from my face because when I was under the sun for a whole day my nose got red.,0
"This trio - in the Santorini color - is PERFECT for business travel. All I need for a complete, natural, work-appropriate look is this, some tinted moisturizer, mascara, lip gloss, and I'm all set.
I use this for both contouring and as an eye palette. For eyes, use the darkest color in the crease, the pink all over the lids, and the highlight color on the inner corners and brow bone.
I contour the rest of my face using the dark color in the hollows of my cheeks and perimeter of my face. Pink on the apples of my cheeks, and highlight high on the cheekbone and center of the forehead. I just do my best to sweep my brush in one color at a time. The strips are a little thin, so the colors will mix a little, but it still works out nicely.

The reason I didn't give it five stars is because I think a that with few small tweaks, this palette would be a cult favorite. First, I wish the contour color did not contain shimmer. The whole palette has very subtle shimmer, which is perfect for the highlight and blush, but I wish the darkest color was completely matte (which is what you want for contour). I also wish the pink was a tad brighter. It's a bit of a dull color that reminds me of blush from the 90s. But I deal with those minor gripes because this really is a great all-in-one travel product.",1
"Quite possibly what I received was a defective bottle, or one that was badly affected by being shipped during the recent heat wave.  The cans dispenser just never worked properly.  By the third use, it wasn't reliably dispensing product.  By th fourth use, it simply didn't work at all.",0
It's 3 months later and I've already gone through 5000 flashes? Seems like the head shipped with this one must have been defective to die so early.,0
I used this a few times before going to the beach.  Got a sunburn on my face each time I used it.  Can't understand how that happened since this is supposed to have SPF 50. (I'm not a fair skinned person who burns easily),0
"I thought for the money that I would really like this. I don't. I tried to apply some to my cheeks and barely got any color at all. So I rubbed my fingers on a little longer and applied....still barely any color. I was hoping for more considering I paid $20. Not impressed.
Note to Self: Just cause you pay more, doesn't mean you get a good product. Sometimes the cheaper stuff works better! (I bought a $7 bronzer by Rimmel and I love it) haha",0
"As a few other reviewers point out, the product itself is great but the pump dispenser is flawed.  It pumps out the cream intermittently.  Unfortunately, I will have to return it for a refund and hope to find it in a simple, trouble-free squeeze tube.",0
As expected.  Prompt delivery.,1
"Works great, not too loud. Definitely dries my hair in much less time than the stuff you get at drugstores!
I'll stick to salon-quality hairdriers from now on",1
LOVE this product!  It's truly hydrating and great for winter skin!,1
"Horrible, gritty product.",0
"Pros: nice color, really does NOT chip!  8 days and counting...
Cons: weird stains appear after a few days

I just got my first shellac manicure (3 coats of polish, and a top coat), using CND strawberry smoothie.  I really like the color, a very light pink with just the smallest hint of a very fine sparkle.  (Very refined, no huge sparkles.)

However, on the third day after my manicure, I started to notice some grunginess around the tips.  I did a little research, and I see that other people have had the same problem. Somehow, in the lighter shades, the polish attracts some kind of stains.  Rubbing with a dry cloth seemed to help a little, but they keep coming back.  It's not terrible, but when I pay $30 for a manicure, it's because I want to look bright and polished, not like i didn't do a good job of washing my hands.

Other than that, today is the 8th day since the manicure, and there has been no chipping or peeling, and I'm delighted with that.  I tend to be pretty hard on my hands, and with this shellac manicure, you can't really tell.",1
Heaven in a bottle for preggo woman!!,1
"It's too big though, should have gotten 1-1/2"" but the product itself works well and transaction was fast and easy",0
My barber introduce me to Layrite and I never looked back. It has a nice firm hold with a natural look and easily rinses out in the shower.,1
Great product.,1
The very best brand on the market.  My last Hot Tools Professional curling iron lasted over ten years and when it broke my husband said to make sure I get the same brand.  I have heavy course hair and this is hot enough to curl my hair.  This brand is the one to buy!,1
"Love how quickly it helped to rid of pimples for me, I usually put it on and sleep w it on",1
I absolutely love this hair dryer.,1
Love,1
"I really like this oil. I have dry hair and this soaks right in, doesn't leave my hair looking oily, but moisturizes it and makes it shiny. I use it while flat ironing, and after styling on my hair while its dry. It works both ways.",1
great mositurizing and smoothing conditioning!,1
Threw this away because it made my boyfriend break out!,0
I like this lip scrub. It realy makes they lips very soft but Im not sure if it is worth the price! If it was a less expensive I will love it more.,1
"I love this product. It is great product. If you have curly, thirsty, frizzy, thick, or tagled too thin hair you will loooovvvve this product!!! The shine is phenomenal. Mayonnaise makes me want to vomit. Why anyone would put that in their hair for shine is beyond me. This product is the bees knees of shine and de-tangler products. It's next to NONE. I don't know why they don't advertise on TV. It smells wonderful. And it feels so good on skin and hair. Nothing has ever worked for my mixed race hair better than this product. My hair is THICK, THICK, THICK, curly, frizzy as hell and coarse, but it bounces and flows like Native American hair. This product helps get it under control before I blow dry and flat iron. I add the Rusk Thermal serum after I blow dry for flat ironing with my Rusk Heat Freak Flat Iron - which is the BEST flat iron on the planet for mixed race women! And, I get so many compliments on my smooth and shiny look. RUSK IS THE BEST OUT THERE!!! As soon as I find it in a store cheaper, I will go there. Amazon is too expense. They are nothing like they used to be. The person running Amazon now is a money hungry greedy jerk. Anyway, this is good product. I'm glad I discovered it here. I refuse to pay for shipping anymore or for higher priced Amazon Prime membership. I got an email saying that I'd have to pay $69 instead of $49 for student prime this year. They charged my account $119!!! That's waaaay more than $69!!!!!! Amazon is run by greedy idiots. And, they need to get Chinese sellers OFF of here. Horrible business practices!",1
LOVE this cream.. Makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth.,1
Counterfeit. Don't buy.,0
This is the best hand cream I've used for my sensitive skin. I keep it close to the kitchen sink and bedside table. The scent is delicate and does leave a oily/greasy film on the skin.,1
"Before Clairisonic, my skin felt dry and rough, had enlarged pores and was always super oily. My Clairisonic has completely changed the texture of my skin - in a good way! After daily use, my pores are less noticeable, my skin less oily and I have less breakouts. I've tried a variety of brushes and this one (as it says) helps to get deeper into my pores. I've been using this for several years now and will never quit!",1
"I love Essie nail polish, but for some reason this one chips off very easily. Maybe it's the shimmer.",0
"There is nothing like triple-milled soap and this one has been a favorite of mine for decades. Feels and smells great. Scent is not too strong, not too sweet --- just wonderful. Was thrilled to find it on Amazon.",1
"Junk mascara in my opinion! I used 2 coats which did not even match a single coat of YSL or Tarte mascara. Took 3 rounds of using my mascara remover (which removes even waterproof in one sweep) to get this stuff off. Very clumpy when removing, leaving my lashes sticking together. In the end it cost me several lashes which did not make me happy. I definitely do not recommend nor will I buy this brand again.",0
It is not powerful at all!!! Do not recommend this product,0
returned,0
Makes your face not feel like a Brillo pad and it's smells good. Buy some. Use it. This product receives my stamp of approval.,1
"Lasts and works well to conceal without causing obvious white/light circles under eyes or wherever it is applied. HOWEVER, I found that it settles in wrinkles and creases EXCESSIVELY.  I was constantly having to smooth under my eyes (every hour at least) because of this.  I have switched to a Lancome concealer (in a tube) and have zero problems with coverage and NO creasing.  I'm using the Jane Iredale above to cover vein spots on my legs but no longer use it on my face.  :(  Will not purchase again!",0
"very disappointed with the quality, my previous Clarisonic worked perfectly for 6 years, this one is broken in less than 7 months. Not sure if its a real brush, feels fake.",0
"Very' good product, I used Latisse for years and this product is very close to Latisse's.",1
One of my all time favorite colors!,1
"getting better will continue using  for the next couple of months time will tell.
Works as good as anything on the market",1
First time I bought a volumizing spray and it definitely works!,1
"Loved it! Unfortunately, the blush was broken on the coner. Luckily, it wasn't too bad and I fixed it by using a butter knife and some alcohol. ",1
nop.,0
"I usually get the green cup by Proraso but decided to try this one since it was supposed to be for ""sensitive"" skin. It lathers up just as well as the other kind, however it just doesn't feel as if it protects my face as much as the other one I usually use. The smell isn't much at all, so no perfumes here, and as I mentioned it lathers well, and maintains well. With the green tub I feel the blade glide across my face, with this one it just feels like there is nothing between my skin and the blade to help the razor along.
A side note is that my facial hair is very rough and thick, so this could have something to do with it as well. Just something to keep in mind when deciding on whether to purchase this one or another. Personally I'll go back to the one I usually buy.",0
This works well on my hair,1
I am still using this but not seeing much of a result.,0
I am glad they bumped the spf to 50 but the light tint is to light for me.  When I reorder I will get the darker tint.,1
Really like this product a lot. It has become a staple to may makeup bag.,1
"I love love love this product! I use it as my everyday shine and protect from sun. I will never use another product! This one is the BEST!
And even better, the seller provided some awesome high class samples of shampoo and conditioner that I absolutely loved!! Seller answered all my questions about the duo sample so quickly and I will purchase again!! Happy happy",1
The image c masque is easy and effortless to use. Only on your face for a short period of time.,1
"People raved and ranted about how this product was some type of magical miracle duck tape for nose pores that would immediately unclog all your pores. LIES!! I decided to buy this because being someone who works around horses a lot, my pores tend to be clogged more than I'd like to admit. I tried this out so excited and with high expectations. I took a nice hot shower, exfoliated my skin, then applied this mask and waited for it to dry completely. At minimal it took out small amount of debris from my pores but nothing enough to justify the price tag. So I decided to use this product every night for 4 days straight. I was hoping that maybe it would get better with each use. NOPE! at best it rips out the micro hairs we all have on our faces and thats about it. I've had better luck with Biore nose strips from walmart! This stuff is NOT worth the price and I'm more tempted to stick actual duck tape to my face than buy this product again",0
This doesnt work at all - instead of making my lashes grow it made me feel itchy at night after a month in.,0
I works well and Im very happy with it.  However I found it on eBay for $21.50 no tax and free shipping.,1
"Love the spray but when it arrived to my house, it had leaked out a lot of the product.",1
"I recieved a shipment as indicated; however, the eyeliner was not there.  Only 3 pieces were included.  2 kindles and a cover.  Double checked through packaging and no eyeliner.  Please explain what to do, considering the price!",0
Only have had it a few weeks.  My Beautician recommended it to combat some damage I incurred.,1
"I bought this to curl the lashes at the corner of my eyes- the lashes the full size curler misses. My lashes are exceptionally long but were too long for this curler. The top part of the curler isn't open, so the lashes were squished up against it. I would not recommend this product. The curlers with the open, metal design are better. I ended up getting one of those.",0
"I have used this product before.  It is creamy and sets semi matte. I wear my foundation moderate to full coverage and like to use this for touch-ups (T-zone mostly) for the following reasons: it goes on quick and easy. For my budget it is expensive and try to stretch the life. For more coverage in spot areas, I will dab with my fingertip as using a sponge (I believe) absorbs 50% more product. The micro-screen over the foundation is effective in controlling too much product being transferred to the sponge at once. Results are beautiful!",1
I've had this hair dryer for about a year and a half and it's no longer working. It's so loud there is something broken. Would not recommend,0
You sure have to have a steady hand.  Not easy to use at all.  Darn! Great concept,0
"It's nice, but you need to be Hercules to grip the bottle hard enough to use the spray with one hand.",1
Smell lingers for days after application,0
Did not live up to expectations-minimum volume and the pump worked poorly.,0
"I have used Hot Tools curling irons exclusively for many, many, years, with no problems at all. This one is VERY hot on the lowest possible heat setting! Also, the little knob that controls the temp moves too freely. I have only used it a few times, because if I can't control the heat at all, I will burn my hair! Maybe I got the ""lemon"" in this batch!",0
I swear by this stuff to all my friends.  I have always exfoliated my skin and this stuff is by far the best I have ever used.  My skin is always so fresh and soft after I use this product and keeps my skin looking young!,1
"This foundation is very sticky and does not provide enough coverage for blemishes. It is also too dark for very fair skin. It may be good for medium skin tones with clear skin. I've been mixing it with a lighter foundation to add some color, so it wasn't a complete waste of money. Still wasn't worth the price in my opinion.",0
"I received this hair dryer for Christmas this year and am extremely pleased and impressed with it.  I have 30"" of hair in my longest layers and it can take forever to dry in the mornings and keep it from getting thick and wavy.  I was able to dry my hair in under 5 minutes with wonderful shine and smooth texture with this dryer.

One of the first things I noticed about it compared to my old, $10 value-store Vidal Sassoon dryer is the weight.  Yes, it is a much heavier dryer compared to the Conairs and store models.  However, unlike the medium and large sized cheap dryers, it feels very high quality and substantial in your hands.  It's well balanced and made of very nice quality materials.  There's a ceramic heat frame that runs through the entire barrel of the dryer, unlike the others that have only a small piece of ceramic coated aluminum at the head of the barrel.

There are three heat settings (none, cool and hot) and low/high blow settings. I used high heat and high blow setting for my completely wet hair and saw great results. I'm really glad I asked for a nice, high quality dryer for Christmas.  It's a huge difference compared to all the dryers I've bought in Target/Walmart before.",1
Giving two Stars nectar I like the scent of the product. What can I say.. use a  little and it does absolutely nothing but make your hair shiny and smell good. There was no hold or way to shape my hair. The product did not have any hold until a generous amount was used which makes your hair stiff and unmanageable,0
"Whenever I wear this, people tell me that I smell nice.",1
"I have slightly damaged coarse thick hair that is color treated and usually love Phyto products however this one is a waste of money.  It does absolutely nothing to my hair, and I have tried on numerous occasions when my hair has been dry, wet, damp, you name it.  Long story short: don't buy it.",0
It doesnt get hot enough to keep the curl in my hair. I would return it but my husband threw the box out.,0
"I can't describe what it does, but it feels great. The smell is strong at first but it leaves a delicate scent.",1
Outstanding product,1
prefer unscented products.  This one has a perfume that lingers,0
"I've been buying the very expensive candles for years, and they run out pretty quickly. This is a nice way to get the scent without having to burn candles.  The only thing is that the scent is slightly more soapy smelling than the candle for some reason. I still love it but its a slightly different scent.  We have dogs that sleep in the bedroom and so this helps mask that odor.",1
While this product went on nicely and looked good for the first hour or so I found that on me this product flaked off in chunks in about hour two.  I have monolids and it's really hard to find a product that stays on and doesn't smear so I had high hopes but they were dashed.  I also had a minor allergic reaction to this product as well.  I am fairly sensitive with makeup products.  Some eyeliners cause problems so I guess I need to stick with Loreal for now...,0
"So, I bought this nail polish because my one of my friends had this color and I thought it was gorgeous!  This is a really bad picture of the bottle, and the color goes on much more purple and light, and less bluey.  The color looks pretty good on it's own, and dries fast.  But it does chip off really easily, even with a top coat.  You need at least two coats, otherwise you cant see it at all!! It is pretty much one color, so if you want to give it some variation put sheer pink glittery polish over it and it will warm it up; super sheer white glittery top coat with blue flecks on top looks good too!",1
This was my first time trying Butter London nail polish and I did like it.  The color was nice but I am not sure I would purchase again at the price.,1
Waste of money and time on this product!  I found the tube scrubs purchased at the corner store work far better.  I have not seen any improvement in my skin as shown by the maker after following their instruction over the recommended period of time. I do not recommend this product.,0
"This is the third one ,fully recommend to try it ,good for my skin!!!Just use it when your skin feel dry..",1
"This curler is made of high quality material at a reasonable price.  Since it is used near the eyes, it has to be made of good material. The nice feature of this curler is it uses chamomile moisturizing pads, each of them suppose to last 3 months.  The package comes with 3 pads.  Maybe because this product is very new, I can't find any replacement pads being sold on Amazon.com.  I guess they will show up before these pads are used up.

The design and construction allow easy application and produce desirable results.  I recommend it!",1
"I can't believe the product came with the plastic seal broken and box totally open... Besides, the scent is a kind of different and lighter than the other one I had. This is the first time that I have to deal with a decepcing parfum bought here, even considering this supposed to be a Boss...
... And return is not an option for me because I'm outside of US.",0
always have used Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo smells good leaves your hair nice,1
Best Curling Iron I've ever owned!,1
Given as a gift which seems to be used daily.,1
"Warning, after a few seconds of nice apple flavor there comes a sharp ""spice"", is the best way to describe it.  Maybe it's a chemical reaction for the whitening, but it is strong and unexpected.
Toothpaste also leaves quite a thick pasty coating on tongue.",0
"Lightweight gloss and heat protection when blow-drying. Smells fantastic, not cloying or too strong. Use after drying to touch up and smooth.",1
Smells nice and is really creamy.  Absorbs nicely.,1
Not impressed it was expensive and I have had it for a month and the cradle cap is worse now.,0
The pic was shown for non colored hair but I got colored hair,0
Best shaving soap..,1
"I ordered this cream to get rid of dark spots under my eyes. Seems to be fading, but I have really noticed my lines around my eyes are softening,  I also use cream on my lip lines, top and bottom, and have really noticed an improvement.  I would definitely buy this eye cream again.",1
I was liking it and it fell to the ground and broke! I was crushed! Maybe I will get another!,1
"Full coverage but not masky.
I got the color 6 for my light medium toned skin and its a bit too light. 7 might have been a better match esp in summer.
Easy to spread over sunscreen. You really need to use a good sunscreen under it (I use Bioderma Laser) since this won't be applied thickly enough to give adequate UV protection.
I only need about 5 tiny dots on my face then blend well with fingers. It helps to warm the tube in my pocket before applying so that the product thins out better.
No powder needed and I apply the tiniest dots under eyes and sides of nose as concealer.
The only problem I have with it is the cyclopentasiloxane which is a known acne trigger for me, but so far so good as long as I cleanse it off well.",1
"I love OPI...and will always use it!  And this color is just too cute!  Great for summer, actually anytime you want a pick-me-up this would be great!",1
"I absolutely whole-heartedly endorse this product. For my fellow skin-weary, and skin wary friends, that are sick and tired of gimmicks and products that are sitting in your ""stuff"" drawer, please give yourself a break and consider NIA24. I have tried numerous products, and have finally given up on gimmicks and junk to purchase this pure, effective, totally all-around excellent skin care product.  After using this for years, I finally lost my 'contact' in the skin care business and had to pay retail on Amazon, which killed me, but after not using this produce for seven months, I truly noticed a definite decrease in my skin's healthy look.

As I take very good care of my skin.  Diet first:  weekly, I eat a really ""clean"" diet full of berries, kale, &  yogurt (I blend all 3 in my Vitamix every day for a total energy and skin BOOST). Next, try to make sure to get Alaskan salmon 2-3 X wk, plus chicken, avocados, 1 oz. almonds, eggs, fruit & more dark veggies, etc.but it is worth it. My skin is vibrant and pretty darn great for my age.  So, as all of you who take the time to read this review, you certainly already know about the benefits of a baseline awesome diet.

If you go online and read about what Niacinamide does for the dermis, you will be amazed in that it really does strengthen the stratus corneum, mid-dermis, and lower dermis to the point that superficial toxins are eliminated from getting deep down where pollutants and topical irritants may get in the way of skin health.  Think about Nia24 as a barrier, and a combatant, to all the nasties, particularly sunlight, that eat superficially at our skin and cause dark spots, acne, and irregularities in the surface. Make sure you follow with a great sunblock, every single day, whether you are exposed to sunlight or not.  The NIA24 Sun Protection Brand is a little pricy, and does give your skin & neck, or any area you apply it to, a temporary ""whitish"" tinge, as it is a block, not a screen.  It does work best for those of us who need instant protection (this product and any other sun protection product that is sold as a sun ""block"":  immediately after applying, you are ready for sun exposure, instead of waiting the suggested 20-30 minutes for typical 'sunscreens' to be absorbed.

Important to understand:  applying a sunscreen, and IGNORING the recommended time (usually 20-30 min.) for the product to absorb fully, equates to going out in the sunshine and not wearing any protection at all, for 20+ minutes.  That is enough time to do significant damage to exposed skin.

Bottom line:  I believe this product is an effective, pleasant, and easy way to incorporate a great product into a daily program for those of us on the run and are either too busy or too lazy to do a ton of homework for the ""end all solution"" for beautiful skin.  I hope this helps you!",1
"Not something I reach for often. This is more whiteish pink on me than a light gold that I was hoping it would be. You definitely need to prime before and set with a shadow or it will smudge, and I don't even have oily eyelids! Personally the mac paintpots are a lot better. I got this on sale for like 10$ and I would not purchase again even if it would go on sale. This isn't a bad product if you use it properly. I was just expecting more from a higher end cream shadow, I shouldn't have to do all those steps. The color isn't bad either. I will continue to use it. The color is perfect for an inner corner highlight, however I have very watery eyes and my inner corners are always the first to have the makeup removed because of that. This product did not last through that either.",0
"The Mercur blades are great for one/two shaves. I found the Astra better based on number of blades. Both shave great, but value is key here.
**Update** Once I relearned how to shave with this type of blade, I get five shaves vs the one/two before.",1
"Very see through. You can hardly tell there is polish on. its almost like a top coat for a French manicure-where you can still see everything underneath it. It's basically a top coat with a slight tint. If that's what you're looking for, this may be the polish for you.
From looking at the image online, I thought it was an opaque color, or at least somewhat opaque. It's totally translucent though.
Hope this helps your decision.
Cheers!",0
This product was completely defective. It never dried. I put it on and did some things in the kitchen and three hours later it was still completely gooey.,0
"Two coats of polish and one coat of top coat - lasts for at least 10 days.....no chipping, peeling, etc.",1
Started on a lower temp and worked my way up-- I'm using it on the highest settings and the curls do no hold. I think my old Conair did a better job for half the price  :/,0
"I love this product; it's the only spray that really is weightless, and does not feel like glue. It's wonderful for fine hair, and I never want to use another product again.  That being said, every single can I've received is defective.  I know the manufacturer knows this, because I was told that by a distributor of the product, who sold  me six cans and refunded all the money I paid for them...because they were ALL defective in one way or another.  If the spray cap worked, the propellant didn't.  If the propellant worked, the spray cap didn't.  I have called the manufacturer myself, and received replacements...but this does not solve the issue! I have purchased the product in many different stores, both physical and online, and it's always the same problem.  So, great product...when the can works.  Good luck!",0
I love it,1
"Great value for the size! My issue is with the pump itself. The pump always hardens since there is not ""cover"" and so like soap the first pump after a day of sitting there it is hard then the liquid comes out after. After 2 weeks of use my pump broke! So now I have a huge jar I have to keep opening the top up for.",0
"Good product, but please research how to use it beforehand",1
"I have three other ChI hair dryers, all with a professional heavy duty round cords on them, this one has a flat cord similar to all the cheap dryers you would find in a large box store.",0
"I love Fix It but just realized in opening this package that I was sent Balance It NOT Fix It.  I cannot return it because the time has passed, I needed to order this before a long trip. Bummed!",0
"It's gentle on the hands and smells fabulous.  It would be a five star, but for the cost. . . . .",1
I received it on time.  Love this product!,1
"Only use occasionally figuring I have years to remove what is left after professional use; then the machine stopped working. I haven't reached out to the company yet to see if they will replace it, but hoping they will.",0
I buy this as a gift for my mother; it's a good product but overpriced in my opinion.  Competition is just as good but mom's not willing to try other products.,1
"Paid full price for this stuff. I've been using it for a little more than a week per the instructions on the bottle. Doesn't work - my nails are now weaker and softer than before.  This is entirely frustrating because the only problem my nails had prior to using this was that they peeled; otherwise, they were relatively strong.  Going to stop using this and maybe try the Original version of Nail Envy, which I understand actually works.  Waste of money.",0
"I don't understand how this is a ""cleanser,"" I've had it for over a month, it doesnt remove oil or makeup at all. i don't even think it does anything else besides smell good. it broke me out a few times but not too bad, i stopped using it because it is pretty much useless. and i love mario badescu  products, but this one is definitely the worst I've ever tried",0
"I saw this product in a magazine and thought I'd give it a try. It seemed a little pricey for such a tiny product but I thought that if it did what it showed in the pictures it might be worth it. I have very thin/ fine eyebrows and from the description and pictures of the product it should have made them full and less sparce. Well I was very wrong. This product completly demonstrated false advertising. It does not make your eyebrows thicker and the tiny little fibers are more of a nuisance then an adhesive. Also, if you don't comb it through a little the gel forms a hard crust on your eyebrows...lovely. I honestly believe that a tube of Wet N' Wild clear mascara could have achieved the same effect, for about $30 cheaper. Maybe it works for people with thicker eyebrows, not sure but I would definitly recommend reading reviews before you purchase.",0
"Both units arrived unusable, with the product dry and in a completely different consistency. Both went to the trash. Will not order Surface products here anymore.",0
nothing out of the ordinary for the price....do not like matte finish....no reason to use as base coat....did not like the way the bottle opened...very awkward,0
I only gave it 4 stars because i haven't used it long enough.  Can't wait to see if it really works.,1
The smell is to strong and gives me a headache.,0
"I've been using this product for about 2 years now. Nothing else compares. It lasts forever and takes care of odor regardless of climate/activity. I've tried similar products, such as that of Anthony brand and it doesn't compare. A stick of this will also last you a good while.",1
"The 1 1/4 inch version of this curling iron is great, but for some reason the 1 1/2 version doesn't heat up as well or hold a curl whatsoever. Had to toss it.",0
I love this...great smell & long lasting,1
It's the best,1
"It's definitely a little harsh, but couples great with my favorite blade- the dull but smooth dorco 300s.  It's currently my every day razor. Definitely would buy again.",1
"This product once was my favorite but no more. Jack Black for some reason changed Beard Lube's formula from the lightweight silicone based lotion to a plant based dense paste. It's very difficult to wash off of the shaver, leaving residuals that clog the shaver.",0
Feel good. But I haven't seen any difference yet. Not mascara.,1
34 weeks pregnant and no stretch marks so far! I love that it doesn't feel greasy after use. It is definitely worth the cost.,1
"UPDATE:  It's been 8 months and this is still my go to for when I want to let my hair air dry!!  I love this stuff and will definitely continue to use it.  Only thing is, if you live in a place with high humidity it might not be that great.  I find on humid/rainy days my hair does get frizzy pretty quickly.

I have dry frizzy hair, that has some curl/wave to it.  I'm always in search of a product that will allow me to air dry my hair (I hate blow drying) and just go.  And I think this one might finally do the trick.  It gave my curls definition but no crunch like you might get from gels or mousses.  And also didn't dry into a big poofy mess like it normally does.  A+ for this product.  My only issue was that the tube wasn't sealed and leaked during shipping.",1
"My manicurist introduced me to this product a while back to keep my cuticles and nails soft and flexible.  She uses CND shellac nail polishes.  I had used in the past but not as frequently as I probably should have.  I now use it twice a day and I can't believe the difference it has made in my cuticles.  They are no longer rough and cracked, but healthy and soft.  I would definitely recommend this product.",1
"I think the color did not match my hair correctly.  If I order another one, it will probably be the medium brown instead of the light brown.",0
This replacement does not fit properly like the original head. I tried many times to make it work but when I did get it on it would not work properly when you turned on the unit.,0
"LOVE this color - I wear it all the time. It is VERY transparent, however (which is why I took off a star). You have to apply a different (more opaque) basecoat, or apply several coats to get a good color. It would be good for adding sparkle to another color, or just as a slightly transparent polish.",1
"I ordered dark brown and label says Dark Brown but it is in fact Blue Black. . Please resend the correct color and please check that the label is correct!
Thank you
Nina Gershuni",0
nice package and has a good taste and smell also works as should. nice little travel size,1
"This product does what it says it will do and unless someone personally introduces me to a better product, I will continue to use this lotion for a very long time.",1
Lol I thought it was a regular comb.. but I guess not that's my bad though.. although for a beard comb it is too small and the discription did not match actual product when it comes to the length,0
"It feels nice and I think it helps even out my skin tone, but not as great as some of the other masks.",1
"Smells great! It is a no sulfate shampoo so I feel like you have to use a little more than normal to get the entire scalp clean. I tend to get a dry, itchy scalp. This helped, but not as well as some other salon quality tea tree shampoos. Good product, but not the best I've tried.",1
"not bad, trying it out for the first time",1
"There is no way that this is an Arrojo product.  The only reason I bought this online was because I could not get to my salon.  I love Arrojo products.  This knockoff smelled horrible (like old oil) and left a horrible film in my hair.  If I could have, I would have given this zero stars.",0
This product was more watery than original sample I tried.  I did not like it. I would not reorder it online.,0
This is all the difference for a great shave.  I can't stand shaving but this oil makes it more bearable and my face remains smooth and moist all day.  The oil protects while it promotes smoother action from the blades.  This is a game changer for me.,1
"Very disappointed.  I wanted big loose curls and it barely curled my long, thick hair at all.  Curls fell out in 10 minutes - hair spray didn't help either!",0
"It Works!
I get waxed every month (and occasionally shave in between) and I was getting awful, painful ingrowns, until I came across this product! I exfoliate in the shower, then apply after showering. Nice scent, does not irritate. May burn a little within 12 hours after being freshly waxed, but has never irritated my extremely sensitive skin. I can't go without these!",1
Good face wash but I don't see any improvement in dark spots.,0
"Product is goo, but bottle was almost halfway empty. Shampoo is expensive. I expected bottle to be full.",0
"Really didn't work for me. It smelled nice which was great, but didn't do anything. I'm disappointed since it's a teeny tiny $30 tub but oh well!",0
"I have short eyelashes and also irritation with other mascaras. I so wanted this to work for me. Alas, it did not. Yes, I read all the tips and likely all the reviews. It just didn't work for me. It is very goopy and the brush is almost worthless and several eyelashes came off when I removed it. Tried it for a week, no go.",0
"My husband has been using Toppik for years. He has naturally thin hair even though he has quite a bit of it. He uses this product to give volume to his normal hair and so that his scalp isn't as visible. Because it is a powder it goes on easily and evenly. You shouldn't use too much, as it can collect in certain areas. It cleans out of hair easily when washed. If you just want a fuller looking head of hair without the false promises of shampoos and hair transplants, this is a very natural and easy way to get it. I am very anal about hair and when I first met my husband I had no idea he used this product.",1
"I got absolutely horrible headaches from this ""product"", first it triggered migraine attack. Then around 3am I woke up with ""phase 2"", had to take painkiller and woke up eventually totally wasted. What a ""invigorating"" experience!
I doubt tea tree can cause such nightmare, most likely some other components form the long list printed on the bottle. I would advise to stay away from this and just get pure tea tree oil for your hair to mix with something that is know to be good for you, like coconut oil may be.",0
"I wanted to try this before purchasing the regular size bottle.  It has helped my hair feel smooth. I have naturally wavy, fine hair and blow dry straight.  It also has helped tamed my frizz a tad. It's not a miracle worker but I have seen a difference in my hair when I spray, blow dry,  and style.",1
the pen tip is very hard and makes it harder to remove mistakes,0
"Yeah, this stuff is decent as far as creams go. Smells great. The tube itself was, well, way smaller than what I was expecting. Wish they'd make a 5 oz or 6 oz version. 3.4 is just a tad small, but hey, easy to travel with.

I am growing my hair out and need a product that can hold but allow my hair to act freely...this doesn't hold quite enough. End up doing a  small base layer of a thicker wax product and then I run this through after that to get the ""top layer"" of hair if you will, what the wax couldn't (and shouldn't) control.",1
"Although I did not experience anything negative from using this product, I didn't really experience a benefit either.  I was particularly paying attention to the area under my eyes and around the corners, but I have not seen any improvement there, which is a bummer.  Products like this are so expensive, they ought to work great!

I will also caution that a little goes a LONG way with this product - even when I was trying to use as little as possible, a tiny dab was always plenty to share between both eyes.",0
"I don't like CND because it don't make your nails shiny I even got the top coat, and it dried out real fast",0
"The name of this product is very deceiving. With the word ""milk"" in the name, I thought I'd be getting a very gentle, milk-like cleanser. What I actually got was a stringent lotion cleanser with a horrible scent that left my sensitive skin burning, tight, red and hot to the the touch. Not only did it cause irritation, it also stripped so much oil from my face that I was left with that rubbed-raw kind of shine that overly clean skin gets. Not attractive. Horrible product; angry that I spent money on this!",0
"I have been a Toppik user for many years now and have enjoyed the use of their products. I was upset though when I received my purchase that it was not at all as it was shown in their advertisement.
They had a picture of a larger size of the Toppik, 25gm, yet I was sent the small one, 10.3gm?
I was not very pleased to say the least when I open the package..
Besides being mislead, the product itself is fine..",0
"This is a premium nail polish that is formulated without camphor, dibutyl phthalate, formaldehyde, formaldehyde resin and toluene. It is more than just a black nail polish. When painted over another polish, it cracks making some cool patterns. For summer it look terrific applied over white or light pastels. It is quite dramatic when placed over red or orange. But I wasn't especially impressed  when used alone. The polish is quick drying and seems to last.

While naming polishes after international airports is a clever idea, frankly I found the name objectionable and insensitive. ""Whack is crack"" reminded me of the late Whitney's Houston's infamous interview with Diane Sawyer where she said ""crack is whack"", stating that wealthy people would not have to resort to a street drug like crack. I may be unduly optimistic but I assume that most people realize that the city of Houston is not named after Whitney. And for what it is worth, neither the color or the texture evoked the spirit of Houston, a city I have visited many times. That being said, this polish will help you achieve a fashion forward look. I usually just buff my nails, a habit developed after dealing with the disastrous after effects of a year or so of acrylic nails. When I use polish it is usually clear or neutral colors although I do miss the color and creativity I enjoyed with the acrylics.  Still it is fun to play with color and texture. This polish does not contain objectionable chemicals, is quick and easy to use and when used with other colors provides a fun yet classy look.",1
"Smooth, you don't need a lot, Light on the skin and works great",1
Excellent at preventing razor burn for my husband. The only shave soap he can use!,1
Ok but not amazing.,0
"I feel like every time I buy a new pod it is lower in quality and lasts a shorter amount of time than before. Not sure if the company is cutting costs or if they changed the formula. I don't feel like the coverage is quite as good as it used to be, and sometimes I have to fiddle around with the pod to get it to spray at all.",1
"It is not easy to apply, brush isn't good, should be tapered not straight. Don't bother and get the spray easier and cheaper.",0
"Super moisturizing with a nice, light fruit scent. I love the consistency and most of all that it has SPF 30. Great for every day Florida living.",1
"Really good at not pulling on my hair. Only thing is that if you get your hair wet, you need to dry the hair ties.",1
"Last week, I bought a T3 Featherweight dryer at my local Costco for about eighty-five dollars.  It didn't come with a diffuser, which I need for my waves, so I got online to order one.  Since the regular Featherweight is an older model, it's hard to find a diffuser for it.

I actually had to order this from Amazon twice.  The first seller (MidStates Beauty) sent me the diffuser for the Featherweight 2, so it wouldn't fit.  I re-ordered it from a different seller here on Amazon for a dollar more, and this time it was the right one.

The bowl isn't super deep (which I usually prefer), but it's enough to get your hair in there pretty well. It helps create soft waves.

Nice product!",1
Way to much comes out at one time,0
"Disappointed. Very mild fragrance, does not stay very long, ordinary feel. My hair does not feel better than shampoos I can buy in Target and Walmart.",0
Not the same as what you get from the store. Very weak.,0
"I was excited to try this powder given the positive reviews. I didn't even try it because when it arrived, the container looked half empty and the powder looked too dark to be ""translucent."" Returning it.",0
"The first time I bought this product I loved it.  Then last summer I bought this huge container and got burned everytime we used it!  At first I assumed I must have been careless, but after three burns (on me and my preschooler), when we never get burned, I have to blame the product.  Very disappointed.",0
Excelente,1
"Bought this from another store. Loved the smell of almond from the bottle and it reminded me of my all time favorite Garden Botanika almond lotion that was discontinued. Once you put it on, however, it changes to a soapy floral smell. The lotion seems almost watery instead of creamy like most lotions, so it didn't moisturize well on dry areas like elbows. Disappointed!",0
it contains the aluminum component that isn't safe for humans,0
So far I am enjoying this product. It has been approx 2 months and I'm seeing some spots w less hair. It is not painful and easy to use. Will keep using this product. Way better than no! No! Way way way better.,1
recipient loved it,1
"This is a fantastic eye liner pen. It works a lot better if you have eye shadow on first, not so much on just bare skin. But you can control the line and you don't need to shake it to get more ink- so to speak.",1
I wasn't a big fan of this product.  I feel like it my eyelashes look spidery.  Would not buy again.,0
"I made my first purchase of this product at a local salon. I love it, it works ! I paid $70 at the salon and thought maybe Amazon will have it.
I logged on and there it was so I ordered, plus ordered the lash one only for my co-worker. The price for my co-worker was $39.85, my purchase was $48.95 because it mentions the brows. I get the package, the products are the same thing, no difference. What a rip off, they put a different word in the description and charge $9.48 more. So bottom line don't pay the extra for the word Brow like I did. I consider this consumer fraud.
Don't know about others but I work hard for my money and this is just wrong. Enjoy the product, my lashes are amazing !",1
Love love it,1
I don't like color but thats my fault! thought it was darker than it shows in picture. Product as described shipping was fast,0
I didn't notice a difference in my brows or eyelashes.,0
"This is excellent lightweight hairspray. Doesn't gum up hair, even if you go a couple of days without shampooing. I believe I read a recommendation for it in InStyle Magazine.",1
"I've had mine for 14 months and it doesn't even get hot anymore.  It actually hasn't for quite some time, but after the return date...don't you love how that works out lol.  That is why it is getting 2 stars from me.  My hair curls perfectly and holds (with heat!) without issues and i feel like a slob not being able to curl my hair the way i want.  I absolutely adored the Power IQ, but Sally's said they're discontinued.  So, I chose this as a replacement.  Good thing I still have a 1 inch Power IQ in my drawer.  Ps babe, thanks for the gift...i know you meant well...love you!! ;)",0
"Love it, nice scrub and great smell",1
"I bought this because it is tinted and waterproof, but I don't like it.  The tint is too dark for my fair skin and it is very greasy feeling.  I won't buy this again.",0
Love it,1
yikes,0
"I didn't care for this product at all.  This wrap foam seemed like water.  It was suggested to me by a stylist, but I'll stick with my B&B Wrap Foam.",0
"This night cream is extremely greasy, I didn't feel like it absorbed into my skin, it just sat on top so I was greasy and not moisturized.",0
no results,0
It was open it was used,0
Color is fine been goes on very streaky and blobs up. I love OPI so I'm guessing I just got a bummer bottle.,0
I have only used the three step system for close to a week but I can tell my face is healing quickly and I have had a couple of comments on my skin looking radiant!,1
"I have purchased Borghese products in the past and they were great.  However, this one that I received from Amazon was not what I expected.  The color didn't match to what it looked on the site, the smell was horrible and the oily consistency is not close to what I have experienced from Borghese before.",0
"My daughter was complaining about the dry shampoo she had been using, so I decided
to look online to find her a product.  I ordered this one because of its rating and my
daughter just loves it!",1
This product arrived spilled and not sealed multiple times. It is a good product otherwise but it has arrived unsealed with significant product loss and leakage multiple times. It's a useful cleanser that helps with breakouts but there has to be a way to seal the container so it does not spill in transit.,0
"This curling iron does not get very hot at all. I'm not pleased, I actually purchased a cheaper iron at a department store, that does a better job.",0
Bottle top was dented upon arrival,0
Love this blonde color! Finally found an eyebrow pencil that is not too dark or chalky. Perfection.,1
I was having some issues with millia and a few cystic type bumps. Decided to purchase and try the 7 day purge. After the second night the bumps were noticeably flatter. By the end of the week it had dried up the bumps without drying the rest of my face. Millia almost gone. Skin is smooth and tone improved. I was so impressed I then purchased the facial cleanser and moisturizer. And you can't beat the price. My hair salon uses this brand for their facials. Buying it there is about twice the price of Amazon. I have normal skin.,1
"The interesting thing about this product is that so many of its pros also wind up being cons.

For example: the texture of the cream is very light - some have called it almost gel-like, and I'd agree with that.  That lightness makes it easy to smooth on the face.  The downside to that: it's so light that it doesn't impart much moisture at all.  This would be great for someone who doesn't have particularly dry skin, but for those of us who need a big dose of moisture, this doesn't work for that.  For those who benefit from light moisturization, be prepared for how this product gives you that: in my experience, after it's smoothed on, it leaves a lightly tacky, even greasy feel to the skin.

The scent has gotten a lot of mentions in reviews, and there is a reason for that.  I thought it would be fine for me even though I'm very sensitive to strong aromas because ""parfum/fragrance"" is the last item on the ingredient list.  Initially, it seems to have a lovely, light rose scent.  However, that scent doesn't dissipate at all - it just sits there on your face, and for me, it became cloying and eventually overwhelming.  By the time I'd had it on for about a half hour, I'd begun to develop a headache and had to wash it off.  (Side note: it didn't come off easily at all with just water; this is the kind of product that requires some kind of cleanser to totally remove.)

The packaging is nice, in terms of the inside of the box having diagrams and instructions for application of the product, and the jar is quite pretty with a useful mirror serving as the top of the lid.  The downside here, though, is that this obviously requires you to dip your fingers into the product in order to then apply it to your face; as such, even with clean hands, eventually bacteria could start to be a concern, so I would have preferred if the cream had come in a pump-form.

The aspects of the product that don't have ""cons"" - it's paraben free, and even though my skin is highly sensitive, I didn't experience any irritation when I put this on my face.  (However, it is worth noting again that I could only tolerate having it on my skin for a half hour because of the fragrance.)

It's been so difficult - actually it's been impossible, thus far - for me to find a moisturizer/cream that won't irritate my sensitive skin and won't make my extreme sensitivity to fragrance come into play.  This product will likely work for people who don't have to deal with those things and don't require a product that delivers a lot of moisture.  For all of those like me who are on a quest for an effective, non-irritating, non-aggravating moisturizer, the search continues.",0
"The cord length is perfect and won't tangle!! The heat is the best since my other Revlon curling irons both broke on me after at least 12 years. I plan to get the 2'', the flat iron and the 1' as well.",1
Great hairdryer.  Its light weight but the motor is powerful enough to still dry my hair quickly,1
I've owned these gloves for about three weeks now and...I LOVE THEM! My hands are already softer. I like to slip them on right before bed and read and before I even realize it my 20 minutes are up! I also like to sleep in them for a couple hours - talk about SOFT. I'm a HUGE fan of these gloves.,1
Did not work so well for me.  I thought it would work great being from Anthony.  The product did not hold up against body odor.  The Balls Fresh product works better.,0
Not impressed. Soap and water seems more effective.,0
"This color is SEXY! Just when I thought I had enough pink polishes, Essie comes out with a beautiful hot  summery fuchsia and I am forced to get just one more.  While Bottle Service is part of Essies neon collection, I wouldnt classify it as neon because it isn't obnoxiously bright.  As with most neon polishes, this one dries matte, so youll need a top coat if you desire a glossy finish.  The formula is rich, easy to apply, with beautiful color pigmentation.  The color was fully opaque after two coats and has lasted a week now.  In regards to the actual color, I have very pale skin (no tan whatsoever) and this color looks fantastic on and doesnt wash me out like some bright colors do.",1
"As others have noted, the rollers are wonderful, especially for really long, thick hair: bring it on. They heat up in a flash, work beautifully, and are very nicely made and nice to handle.

The travel case, while a pleasant touch, has incredibly tight tolerances and is difficult to both pack and zip up. The clips that come with the set are cheap and are best immediately replaced with something sturdier for the long term.

A special mention has to be made of the heavy-duty plastic clamshell packaging the set arrived in. Other reviewers have mentioned using kitchen boning shears to open it. That isn't a joke.

Nothing short of a chainsaw could easily broach that packaging.

It's extremely annoying at best and flat-out dangerous at worst. And it's packed so closely around the rollers and other items that getting into it without damaging the rollers (never mind yourself) is a real challenge. So, be warned.

I ended up asking my very competent spouse to free my rollers from their poly prison; he scoffed initially but within a few moments there was some swearing and some shuffling in the toolbox. A small handsaw (!!!) did the trick, but even then the edges on the packaging were so sharp--seriously--we both got nicks getting the rollers out.

To sum up: the rollers are fantastic, heat in a blink, are solidly made and do the job beautifully. The vinyl travel case...kind of a meh...the clips, definitely. The clamshell packaging stands alone in a class of Awful.",1
"The wrong color was sent but I tried to make it work, it didn't.  Too waxy.",0
Believe the Hype !! As a series Fraghead this is niche quality juice . Back up bottle worrty . But it before the price goes up excellent blend of honey and tobacco. Define rly a winter fragrance will project excellently in cold weather.,1
I am a freelance make-up artist. Stila lets me put my skills to show. Espically this double-ended shadow brush. This particular shadow brush does not fray nor piece away. I can easily clean this brush with no issues. Fully recommend this to any one.,1
Best smelling dry shampoo out there. It made my hair smell of lemons and it did not cause tangles.,1
Wonderful,0
"I have used this about 4 times. It seems to be working. It seems thin the hair. It is definitely not as fast as a salon laser version. So I think if one is patient they will get results. At the rate it seems to be going, it may take at least 8-10 treatment to have the hair gone.",1
I bought this to use on the T3 Featherweight Journey Travel Dryer.  It snaps onto the T3 perfectly and works really well.  I have curly hair so I really need a diffuser.  With the T3 Journey Dryer I think the pair are actully better than the dryer I use at home!,1
Smells great!,1
"Makes my hair sticky and unmanageable, unbrushable.  I had this great experience once in a salt water pool where after i got out, my hair was this perfect wave without styling, so based on the description I thought this was going to be that pool experience in a bottle.  But whenever I have tried to use it, it just makes my hair rough, sticky, and awful.  Maybe I got a bad batch.  But I keep it around thinking I just need to figure out the right way to use it.  I'll try one more time then probably end up throwing it away.",0
I have used this brand for hair spray and really liked it.  However this product left me very disappointed.  Leaves hair dull and sticky.,0
"Don't buy this. I've had it for less than a year and the hot air has stopped working.
Bought it in May 2017 and it stopped working on March 18th 2018.
Thank you for making me waste my money.",0
"So here's the deal: in September, my skin erupted with cystic acne after a long-term relationship I was in ended. The stress caused my skin to well up in a way I've never experienced before, and it was so tragic it actually distracted me from the break-up. My skin has never been clear, and I had experienced cystic bumps here and there prior to this incident. However, I looked like I had suffered an extreme chemical burn that blistered the entire lower portion of my face.

Panicked, I went to Ulta to find makeup strong enough to cover my monstrous appearance yet gentle enough not to exasperate it. That's when I was directed to this Juice Beauty kit, in an effort to ""change the canvas, not paint over it"" as the Ulta rep (with flawless, glowing skin) put it. I bought it with extremely low expectations and extremely high chagrin.

About a week later, I was put on Accutane. This is an extremely powerful medication for only the worst acne sufferers. My doctor forbade me from using any products that were not designed for sensitive skin, so I had to shelve my Juice Beauty kit.

Flash forward to May. I took myself off Accutane because of the horrendous, non-acne related side effects (extreme hair loss, muscle weakness, depression). My skin now, however, is relatively clear, albeit scarred deeply on my cheeks. Since the drug stays in your system for a month after your last dosage, I had to wait before using anything not labeled ""sensitive skin"".

Now it's June. I pulled out my Juice Beauty kit after two little pimples started sprouting on my face. I used the wash in the morning (I use a gentle, cream cleanser at night) and the serum at night under a heavy moisturizer. I used the peel once, and sporadically use the oil-free moisturizer. My pimples were gone in two days! I've also noticed that my scar tissue is less pronounced, as I believe the product is evening my skin tone.

My final thoughts: 1) Don't expect a miracle, especially if you have cystic acne. See a doctor. 2) This kit works best for people with acne-lite, meaning those irritating chicks that cry when they get a single spot on their faces. Basically, people who are non-acne sufferers that occasionally break out. 3) Best products in this kit are definitely the serum and the wash. They really do work, and they're gentle. I will definitely be repurchasing them. 4) The moisturizer leaves a bizarre, sticky finish and the peel felt pointless. Smelled, looked, and felt like applesauce. If you're into that, awesome, but those two products were let downs for me.

Hopefully this very thorough review helps some of y'all that are suffering. Believe me, I know what it's like. I simply think it's silly that some of the reviews on here are actually blaming the product for their acne... Acne comes from within 99% of the time, so you have to address that before any single product can help you.

Much love everyone! :)",1
go's along better then stor-bought.,1
I recently started back using Mizani products. My hair was badly damage from a previous product that I was using. My niece was using it and reminded me how my hair was when I was using Mizani then. As soon as I started using this I could tell an immediate difference in my hair. My hair is back soft again and my edges are growing back. The smell of it is okay with me and like other reviewers have stated it doesn't take much. I use a little on my hair after I shampoo and before I wrap it. I also took a little and added it to a daily hair oil conditioner I am using to oil my scalp once or twice a week depending on my mood!,1
"A very high quality shampoo. One of the best I have used for my color treated hair. The smell is soft and mild which I prefer, and after using my hair is squeaky clean and feels great!",1
Amazing! My hair is healing!!!! I could never go back to those $20-40 flat irons. They work no where as well!,1
It leaves a weird residue feel in the hair.,0
love this product!!!! best face sunscreen ever,1
Reuzel never disappoints!,1
"I so badly wanted to like this polish.  I am all about wearing pink in October, so I jumped all over this when Cut & Blow offered a good deal on it and its companion polish, Pink Works.  Imagine my disappointment when I tried to wear it last week.  This might be the worst formula polish I have EVER worked with.  Sheer but patchy, lots of dragging, and even after three thin, even (well, as even as I could manage), there were still unevenly-colored spots on my nails.  Such a disappointment.  If you're looking for a pretty pale pink shade - KEEP LOOKING!!",0
I had a facial on a cruise ship and they used this product and talked highly of it. They also said I couldn't buy it anywhere else and found it amazon I have used it for a few months and don't see a difference I also use other eye products in combination,0
Good,1
I love this stuff.  Best tinted sunscreen in my opinion.  Goes on smooth and is not smelly or oily.  Really like it!,1
"I bought the ""try me"" pack of all three products - loved the bio-cleansing conditioner and the anti-residue cleanse, but I will not be purchasing the full sized bottle of this. It smells nice, feels nice, but left my hair crazy oily. I'm no stranger to masks and conditioners, and had to jump back in the shower after using this.

If you haven't tried it, consider buying a small bottle in the trial pack.

I found that on the days I use the cleanse, I follow it up with the bio-cleansing conditioner and my hair looks great. Or, find a mask that you love and stick with that.",0
The product did last long on the eyes but only provided 3 times of use in total! Definitely not a practical purchase.,0
Not authentic,0
"I read a lot of reviews online and everyone seemed to rave about the Jack Black Clay Pomade, but that has not been my husband's experience. The product has a nice feel and the smell isn't bad, but it does not hold at all. By 1-2 hours into his day his hair doesn't even look fixed anymore without him even having touched it. Sadly disappointed.",0
i piece of crap that doesnt work,0
Not moist at all.  Very dry,0
too drying,0
Like this product and the color is great. Would definitely purchase again because I love how it looks but it is definitely not water resistant or even what I would consider long wear. I have worn it twice since purchase and both days had to touch it up and I didn't come into contact with any water or weather. Still a great blush though.,1
"This product does not do what the company leads you to believe.....It's commercials are  Very misleading.
If you are looking to tighten skin,, this is not it.!
 It does ,however, moisten dry, scaly, skin, but I believe ANY  moisturizer would do this if applied to the area daily.
Cheap, drugstore stuff, hey Crisco would wipe away crepe skin.
I am a junkie when it comes to new products, I've tried them all
This product is not worth it
Big disappointment!",0
"First off, I am loving all these reviews about burnt hair. If you haven't used this before- don't start on the hottest setting! Try and start on the lowest and work your way up. I have really long hair and curls normally do not stick well with any other curling iron. I use the hottest setting on my hair and my curls hold all day and then some. I don't use any product and I normally just let my hair air dry. Because I've been using this for years, I use it on the hottest setting and know how long to keep it in for. The only reason I do not rate this 5 stars is I always have to replace mine every year or two. It gets super squeaky in the spring and it hurts my ears, and it breaks really easily if you drop it (I have tile floors). But it works great....",1
"My skin is a little sensitive, but this one works well. I gave 4/5 only because of the price. Just after I ordered one, the seller decided to decrese the price! What a pity. If you want to buy one, wait and compare the price!",1
Amazing results.,1
"Just got it and it smells like baby powder almost, good thing is is that i love that scent. Feels nice and is a fine mist!",1
Great product makes my hair very manageable .,1
Applicator sends very small amount of fibers with each press; your wrists can get tired,0
I use it for heat protection and to lay down some frizzies since I have wavy hair.  It leaves a really nice shine.,1
"This is my first butter polish and I'm just not that impressed. I LOVE the effect of this polish (the blue iridescence is so cool!) but the polish starts chipping around the sides of my nails after a couple of days. I'd expect longer wear, and the same thing happens with or without a top coat. It's just not worth the price!",0
"As a fragrance connoisseur, I keep a rotation reserved exclusively for summer (cool, clean, citrusy, aromatic) scents and a separate rotation for the winter months (warm, spicy, deep, woody) scents. However, the shoulder seasons of fall and spring don't always cooperate with either rotation; too cool for aquatic fragrances while still too warm for the spicier ones. Vintage by John Varvatos has become a staple within my collection because it fits perfectly in those shoulder seasons. It is lightly warm due to the tobacco, fir balsam, and Tonka bean notes but the white lavender and jasmine notes balance it out nicely so that I can wear it almost any time of the year. I would classify it as equally well suited for casual events, work, or an evening out; it smells pleasant, very masculine, and classy. However, it is probably a little too casual for a black tie event. Nevertheless, a great fragrance to have on hand for any season or when you can't decide what to wear.",1
"I've tried other facial sprays, and they're nice and will do in a pinch, but this is by far my favorite. I love it, especially for the price!",1
"They use microplastics as exfoliator! The tiny beads are too small to be captured through existing wastewater treatment processes, and wash straight into the ocean where they harm fish and other sea life. Please think twice before buying it!",0
"Plastic hollow tubes (like regular rollers you would use for wet hair and wear for hours waiting to dry) that do not heat up.  Ridiculous attempt at ""hot"" rollers.",0
"First, be aware that this bottle is TINY. I was picturing a normal-sized product bottle, but for one Alexander Hamilton you are buying a trial-size bottle. Second, for me at least (normal to fine hair, shoulder-length, slight wave, wash every other day), this does not work any better than the Suave brand dry shampoo that costs three bucks for six ounces. That's more than 40 times the price. Wow. Works OK, not great.",0
"I bought it to cover my wrist tattoo since it can't be visible while I am at clinical (for nursing school).  It didn't really stay on.  My tattoo was visible within the hour and since my uniform is white I couldn't risk it rubbing off on it.  I even used the setting powder, but no luck.  Maybe if it was in an area that was not as often touched or moved it would have worked better.",0
A Good Solid Razor.  Tames down my feather blades and makes them a little less irritating. I like the long handle.  It could stand to be a touch heavier.  Overall a good razor.,1
My favorite hair product--keeps body in hair at all times,1
Secret Obsession is one of my favorites in part because if its longevity. Think something went wrong with this batch because its missing that deep richness and those lingering notes.,0
Product (shampoo) had leaked all over. I've had better packaging from Walmart.com. Actually what had leaked was hard and crusty making me think this product is old. I'm not sure what it's supposed to smell like but I wasn't crazy about it. I hope it doesn't hurt my hair!,0
"So I have been using the same Vidal Sassoon dryer for at least 8 years.  I have been impressed with how long it has lasted.  However, lately, it just smells like burning and finally is giving up the ghost.  It was 2000W, it was ""ionic.""  It was shooting sparks out at me.
So I bought this one based on the reviews.

Normally when I am ready to dry my hair, I turn on the ceiling fan and jack up the a/c in that part of the house.  The heat makes me sweat and I have to do it in bursts.  I also turn on my hair straightener, as I will have to calm my mane once it's dry.

Uh, so I went in and used this dryer with the same protocol.  4 minutes later, my hair was dry.  I was not sweating in the least.  I didn't have to use my flat iron.  I walked back out and my family said (not looking up), ""Hey!  Weren't you gonna go dry your hair?""

I am so sold.  Nice job.",1
"Good, but Not worth the price",1
"I ordered this product from this company ,I always order in advance to make sure I don't run out , When I opened package
the pump wouldn't work . So I tried to return for one that works , I truly like the product but would never order from this company again they didn't make it good very disappointing to see this happen . They didn't stand behind their broken product . I wouldn't recommend doing business with them ever",0
My wife loves it!,1
"This palette is amazing because of it's versatility.
By lightly using the neutral 'Pro Basics' pans you get a shimmer that can be played down, or just use a small dab of the very lightest one in the inner and outer corners of your eyes to brighten and make them look bigger.
Those looks are certainly appropriate for day wear.
When you feel like having fun, layer on the glitter metalic colors for some serious hi def glam.
And even those, if lightly applied, give the look of freshly fallen snow. Each tiny bit of glitter sparkles as you move, a mesmerizing look.

Here's what is not so great...that glitter tends to travel. A primer is a must here. And after application, the two purples have that grey muddiness that purple shadow often has.

Still, this is such a fun palette to play with and get creative. Palettes are a terrific way to try lots of colors at a much lower cost than single pans or even quads. You might not love them all, but there are always a few that make it worth the price.
For me, the copper with a dab of the lightest one in my inner corner is gorgeous, and worth the price of the collection.",1
I am very disappointed in this product. I received it about 2 weeks after I ordered it. I tried to polish my nails with the product a few days later and the polish was very sticky. I had to remove it and haven't used it since.  I have had this brand before and have never had this problem.,0
"This is a softer white and is perfect for a french manicure. I pair it with CND's 'Beau' and followed another user's directions for the perfect french:

- prepare nails and cuticles, ensuring they are clean and dry
- one thin base coat, cure 30 seconds
- thin coat CND's 'Beau', cure 2 minutes
- thin coat CND's 'Studio White' to tips, ensuring to seal the edge. Use nail brush dipped in 99% isopropanol alcohol to create the smile line/tip while wet. Cure two minutes
- you may need to do a second, very thin coat of white. Cure two minutes.
- one coat top coat.

I sure for at least 6 minutes after the top coat, as the longer cure seems to make my manicure last longer.

Wipe nails with cotton pad soaked with 99% isopropyl alcohol to remove sticky coating. Oil your cuticles and have lovely hands/nails for a couple of weeks!",1
I like it but it does leave a bit of shine once you apply it. I need to use powder after to make it go away but otherwise it's def good for summer and my skin isn't drying out from it,1
This leave in conditioner made my hair feel heavy and oily. I will not be using it anymore.,0
Did not receive original formula!!!!  Big rip off!!!!,0
My favorite color and seems to last a while!,1
Didn't finish the bottle. Shampoo made my hair feel stripped. Conditioner was like applying oil directly to my scalp. Would never recommend.,0
It really works!  My lashes are long and full. Grandelash is on my must have list.,1
This was no good,0
So far so good.,1
it doesnt work,0

I always love this cologne ever since I fist purchased it years ago.  The scent stays with you all day or night and people will notice the scent on you.,1
"This is one of my favorite products, so no surprises here.  I love the bone color as it just lights up the eyes a bit and it goes with anything I like to wear.",1
The product made my face break out.,0
Great quality build. This will last a lifetime.,1
"My hair is bald around the edges from years of tight microbraids.  When I wear my hair back, I was filling in the edges with black eyebrow pencils.  This is much better.  It's more natural looking and much quicker. It takes very little powder to fill a space, so I definitely expect to get more than my money's worth.  Love it!  Love it!  Love it!!!!  This next comment is in response to TR's comment about the  .11 oz bottle of Toppik being the size of a thimble.  TR if you don't like  the product that's fine, but you don't have to lie about the size.  A thimble?  Really?  Please!!!!!  I don't know where you buy your thimbles.  My picture shows the .11 oz Toppik next to a standard size thimble.  You should be careful what you say. People take reviews very seriously!",1
"This is my favorite perfume but the quality of the one I bought was awful. I think it was very, very old and was not worth buying.",0
"Can't tell any difference in drying time, and product seems to really dry my hair out and make it very brittle and straw like.",0
This straightening iron is the right size. It's very hard to tell if it's on because the red light is real dim. Also the top of the iron gets extremely hot. It is hard to bump small pieces of hair without burning your fingers.,0
"I haven't tried the product yet, but this arrived today and 1/3 of the bottle had leaked. Really disappointing to open the box just to see my brand new hair products already open and partially gone :(",0
"This product is great. It is used by my hair stylist. I am a fan of Babyliss products, and this is another great one. It is a lot thinner than most hair straighteners on the market. Initially, I thought that would be a problem, however, it actually allowed for more control. I have color-treated hair and the smaller width allows me to straighten less processed parts (roots) at a higher heat and others at lower temps. It is highly recommended that you read the users manual to better gauge which heat setting is appropriate for your hair type. Though I have only used this product 3 times, compared to others on the market for the same price- I prefer the BaByliss Pro Nano Titanium-Plated straightener.
Minus one star only because I have to hold it at the tips otherwise it is too hot for my finger tips.",1
"I hated it. The lead did not come up when I roll it, and it pops up unexpectedly, could not roll it back in.",0
"First... this thing is so small, even if it had something in it , it wouldnt be large enough to even tell if you liked it or not BUT, mine was EMPTY, I mean, not a drop in it! Also, it says on the box, ""Sample, NOT for resale!  Must say, have always been happy with Amazon but this thing was so BOGUS!!  It didn't cost much , but it is the principle.... I got NOTHING.",0
"This curling iron is kind of tricky.  My hair is short and I wanted some beach waves.  It's a large iron so maneuvering it to a point where I could use it without burning myself was rather difficult.  I plan to give myself more time to experiment with it.  If you want curls or waves...it will work well for you. Longer hair would look great with the concept. Just a small portion of your hair...by the handle is actually attached to the curling iron....then you push a button for it to rotate...kind of tricky.  But, I know when I master it..I will have great waves!",1
"I got this as a replacement for my three year old Chi air. It was a Christmas gift. After not even 4 months of use, it's stopped heating properly and won't even heat all the way. Of course, since it came from Amazon, the manufacture warranty was voided, which I didn't think would be an issue since my old one lasted a good 3 year run with every day use and often being left due to forgetting it was on. It was nice while it lasted...",0
I'd give this mascara 1 star because the bristles are so sharp!! They hurt my eyelids when I try to apply. At one point my eyes started watering because they hurt so much! I'm so surprised that this product received such excellent reviews. Returning this ASAP!,0
I pursued this it was 3/4 full very expensive and very disappointed,0
Didn't really help at all,0
"Great scrubbing bar, not too sandy. Scent is very woodsy - maybe not what I like best in warmer months, but it's so subtle and doesn't linger so I don't mind all that much. Bar lasting a good amount of time so far. I will update when it finally runs out.

Exfoliating properties seem ok, doesn't sand you bloody, but you know the pumice or whatever is in there with each use.",1
"I've used others where I saw results, no results with this product.",0
It was as ok,1
"I was given this scent as a gift years ago.  I was unable to find it in stores, but found it on-line.  The price is great and I love the scent.  It is very light, fresh and clean.  I don't know that it lasts very long, but I do love it.  Other favorite scents of mine are: Michael by Michael Kors...Amarige De Givenchy by Givenchy, and Pear Glace by Victoria's Secret.  These scents are not like the Green Tea by Elizabeth Arden, but give an example of other things I like.",1
Not a good product,0
blowpro works great for me not just for dry shampoo but right after washing and blow drying.  I spray in sections before flat ironing - it really adds great control.  works good with aquage beyond control sprayed after.,1
Good value on an excellent scent.,1
its just ok,0
Good,1
I love this product!!! People comment on how my hair smells so fresh. I have fine slightly curly hair and this product gives me body without weighing my hair down and helps me control frizz. A little of this product goes a long way.,1
"I was very excited to try this as nothing else is working for me for my new friend Rosacea.  It took a lot for me to put out the $85 but if it works then I can justify the price.  It actually made my condition worse.  I'm itchier, redder and blotchier than I was before I used it.  And I actually think I have real pimples now to boot!  So great!
I also made the mistake of putting it around my eyelids to help calm my ocular rosacea so now my eyes feel like they're bleeding.  It's so frustrating how one thing works for someone and is just pure evil tor another.
Still searching....",0
"I sent this Clarisonic Mia 1 Facial Sonic Cleanser as a gift for my wonderful Sister-In-Law. A trial-sized cleanser was SUPPOSED to be included in the box, I did not send her any cleanser separately. Imagine my embarrassment when I learned that the cleanser was not in the box. Thus, she won't be able to use it until I can order cleanser and then send it to her!! That is why I have given this product two stars, even though I don't have any idea how it will work. I did try to have a replacement trial cleanser sent to her, but the only available option was to have her send the entire unit back. I did not want to ask her to do that. There should be an option to replace a missing part, especially when it is so simple as in this situation.
As I consider myself a good amazon customer, I am hoping this review or the next one I write concerning this problem will be easily resolved.
In the meantime, I did order the cleanser to be sent to her.",0
"Love this!!! Fast, easy, smooth, curled and dry hair all in one wonderful tool!!!",1
"does nothing for my fine thin hair, disappointment",0
"These are pretty good! They don't seem to be as large as Biore strips, but they covered my entire nose. The strip dried completely in about 10 minutes. It was easy enough to peel off and it seemed to clean my pores. In my opinion, these are a good value! My only gripe is that they smell a little strong. It is not a horrible odor, just really strong. I was glad when it was time to peel off!",1
"I like the way this goes on, and it feels good on my skin, but the color is too dark.",1
I love the Big Sexy Hair Root Pump mouse. It's the only brand I use because it real makes my hair fuller.,1
"I have oily, acne-prone skin and found this product to sort of leave a film on my face. It did nothing to clear my skin, but it might be good for someone who wants a bit of exfoliation and has sensitive skin..",0
"Personally, I think it is just okay. But man I gotta say THE LADIES LOVE IT!!",1
"I have thin, baby fine hair, so it has been hard to find a styling product that works without feeling heavy.  My hair dresser has used this on my hair several times and gave me a sample.  It does a great job for my hair type.",1
I was sent #5 which is the clear not #3 which is a bleaching cream.  #3 does cost approximately $10-$12 more than #5. I have used both products and love the difference this line has made in my skin.  I am awaiting my refund and looking for someone who actually does #3 as advertised.  Thank you.,0
"This eyeliner does not flow smoothly. Bythe time you get some color on your eye, you've rubbed half your skin off trying to get it to color in.",0
"I thought it would smell like fresh laundry but instead it smells just like bug spray.  I like the idea of having a ""clean"" natural smelling perfume but this scent definitely is not.",0
I believe this is the first review I've written. I didn't buy this on amazon originally but will from here on for convenience. This stuff is amazing. My skin has never felt so soft from head to toe. It's worth the price if soft skin is important to you.,1
Does not dry hard.,0
Not even close to pernox! Very few scrubbing beads.,0
"This did horrible for my skin. After stopping my regular regmine I took this one up and after two weeks I noticed my pores were bigger, fine lines and deeper lines as well as other fine lines across my forehead. I was completely disappointed in this stuff I tried because I was certain it would work. Maybe you will have more luck with this product then I did but I do not recommend to try it if you have something that is working.",0
"This stuff stings, burns, and leaves my skin red! They're giving me hell about trying to do a return. I don't normally have sensitive skin. Would not recommend.",0
"I wouldn't order from amazon online, because the product is either old or fake. Quality is completely different from the ones you buy in store. It paints on very chunky and really a waste of money. Super disappointed!",0
Just opened it for ten first time and it won't even turn on huge waste of money,0
"Ok shower soap.  Smells great!  Seems to do is job and get you clean, but $30 for 10oz of soap?!  Way too much money for a bottle smaller than a can of beer.",0
"This is exactly what I need on special occasions or on very humid/rainy days.  It keeps my hair from going completely frizzy but doesn't weigh it down so it looks greasy.  This is a nice thick consistency and goes on very easily.  I prefer to use it on wet hair and then heat it in with a dryer.  Very pleased - yes, it is expensive but I use this occasionally when I really need to look my best.",1
nice neutral color,1
"I love Essie nail polish, but for some reason this one chips off very easily. Maybe it's the shimmer.",0
"For the price, this is a great straightener. I've had it awhile and I have had no issues. It heats very fast and straightens great. I would recommend this to anyone!",1
This cleared up a zit quickly and helped reduce redness. The one downside is that it left my skin feeling a bit raw when I used moisturizer the next day.,1
"The packaging is really the only aspect of this product that I liked.
As others have said, the quality of the concealer is below that of most drugstore brands.
If you're going to spend this much on a concealer, definitely go with Estee Lauder double wear/armani etc.",0
"This clay mask will change your skin and complexion within a week or two! I swear my skin is less oily after using this for a day or two. I have extremely oily skin so I use this 3 times a week, but sometimes I forget. It does tingly and 'burn' a bit when its on your face but it doesn't harm you at all. I can understand why some would say that it hurts. Try it on a small spot first and see if you're allergic or it harms your skin. If it doesn't harm you then tough out the 'tingly and burning sensation' and it will change your skin for the better.",1
"For already well formed cysts, this isn't an overnight miracle... but with that said, the reduction in just days of use is WORTH IT.  Yes, you can always go to a dermatologist for an injection if you want immediate results, but for this price, I am seriously impressed with this product. I will make sure to always keep it on hand, because if I had it sooner and started using it sooner, I'm sure quick action by using it on fresh breakouts would result in quickly resolving them.

UPDATE: It took about two weeks of steady use applied at least twice a day but a really BAD cyst on the side of my nose is GONE.  This stuff works.",1
"Made my hair feel thicker, more smooth and shiny. Just takes some getting used to. Follow the directions for the best results.",1
"I thought this was going to be yet another overpriced and not-especially-effective skin cream.  Well, it is overpriced, but I have to say it's smoother than facial creams like Eucerin, it's smells great and I actually feel better after rubbing it on my temples.  So, I'd get this again, but I wouldn't pay over sixty smackers for it.",1
"She's happy about it, but it's a bit tricky to get the right shade.
Overall nothing to complain about, I was expecting a bigger tube.. it's so tiny. Then again what do I know about make-up :)

As seen on Michelle Phan make up videos on Youtube",1
This product is DANGEROUS! I applied a coat to my nails and within a minute felt an intense burning sensation inside my fingertips! The pain quickly became unbearable and I had to remove the product and moisturise my nails. It was a truly horrible experience! Please be aware this product can be horribly dangerous!,0
The only negative about this product is that it dries out pretty fast. Would recommend making sure you put the lid on really tight.,1
Burns and inflames face.,0
"Have purchase this product for years. This last jar was way below usual freshness. First of all, it looks like cottage cheese instead of mousse. On top of that there is practically no scent. I usually receive compliments on my scent as it is luscious;nhowever this time nothing. My only thought is that it is from old stock which is very disappointing. Sorry it has taken me this long to review. I will probably not buy this again from them or Amazon. I am already on the search for a new product. Just very disappointed.",0
Didn't  get the results i wanted,0
"When my hair is straightened by a hair dryer and round brush it is close to shoulder length.  My hair is naturally curly; dry; and frizzy.  So far there are no shortcut styling tools that I have found to make my hair smooth or straight unless the tool has a very high heat setting.  The Perfecter does not have a very high heat setting.  I just purchased the Perfecter from a local pharmacy store and returned it the next day.  I believe this hair styling tool may work better on very short hair styles, but not if you have very curly ethnic hair as I do.  It will take several passes through the hair to create an effect though, contrary to what is described in the directions for use.  At first I thought the Perfecter styler was made cheaply, but I believe that it is actually made this way to be very light weight and easy to manage.  I would recommend this product only to people that already have easy to manage hair or to people that want to use it for a touch up only.  It may be just what some people are looking for, but not if you have really unruly frizzy curly hair.",0
"To be honest I didn't recieve the stickey product. I recieved solar oil instead of the stickey product. I thought it would be more trouble and hassle to try and return it, so I am stuck with the oil. I did try the oil but I am not to crazy about it. Pam T.",0
"Doesnt feel like the last one we ordered, feels a lot different. Possibly fake?",0
Doesnt work for me.,0
"When the package arrived, the lid to the product was opened and the shaving soap was nearly as hard as a rock. This being my first shaving soap purchase to use with my first safety raver experience I'm a bit disappointed. Anyone else experience this?",0
"By Boots No 7 T Zone rescue for $10...same product, save your money. We've all heard the hype about the magic French wonders of Bioderma but you can find great lower cost alternivtives",0
"I don't know whether this product is effective because a single use left my baby's hair reeking as if I'd emptied an entire bottle of cheap perfume on her. The smell gave me respiratory symptoms of wheezing and I will not use heavily perfumes items on a baby since they can harm sensitive baby lungs. The intense perfume lingered for 3 days through 2 baths with her usual shampoo! Terrible, they need to make a fragrance free version and stop claiming their products are ""natural"" when loaded with arts facial fragrances!",0
Have used faithfully. Can see no difference. I am very disappointed in this product. I had hoped to see a difference.,0
"This was an impulse purchase.
I had been thinking about how i missed Loves Lemon fresh from the 70s, as i have a rough time with synthetic fragrances, and Loves didn't trigger respiratory issues and smelled so happy.
About an hour later this Mens cologne appeared in my vine queue. In reading that it was citrusy I decided to give it a try. I haven't found a mens cologne i could handle my husband wearing and hoped this would do the trick.
I sprayed a spritz outside to see if it was going to be overpowering or trigger any negative response.
Passed that test, so spritzed once in house and turned on ceiling fan to disperse.
Still good.
Spritzed husband when he got home. Really liked the citrus top note. Smelled of lime to me. The base notes are subtle at first and have a nice depth and complexity that compliment the citrus.
After about an hour went back and had nice lingering hug with husband, and citrus pretty much gone and remaining scent quite different and surprisingly more intense from the starting point. More musky, soapy, linen like. Not bad, but not what i hoped for.
This makes a nice home fragrance spray for tose who don't like overly floral, heavy scents. Doesnt take much!",1
Doesn't help polish last any longer.,0
"Super super strong smell, and not a pleasant smell......The smell is way too strong to let me think about it's face cleansing gel. And, it's ok to be a cleansing but nothing about make up remover.",0
"The name of the product on this listing and the product pictured do not match. Product received appears to be counterfeit and is not even sold by Glo. It is a watery substance, nothing like the genuine product sold by Glo.",0
This is perfect for my hair - well worth the price,1
"this has a great smell, and leaves my curls soft and defined, but it left me with the WORST dandruff ever, and a very dry and itchy scalp. I switched back to my old shampoo/conditioner and its still not gone, I've had dandruff for a few weeks now. :(",0
"This product is too strong for my skin type,  so I suggest that a warning needs to be added to package.",0
"Due to the fact that the Toppik cannisters are extremely poor delivery systems for the product, this maximizer is a very small step improvement.  However, it doesn't evenly ""spritz"" the product onto your hair/scalp -- it merely allows you to direct a big puff of product to a specific spot.  The Toppik product (i.e., the fibers) is quite good, but surely they can come up with a better way to apply it!  I paid $14+ but feel it's a rip-off!  Don't spend your money on this product.",0
"I like the product as it matched the stated description and performance. However, I do wish that it had more bristles to hold the hair more tightly. I have fine hair so they slip out. Great product otherwise.",1
"This is my absolute go to product! I love it. It is awesome to put on after I wash my face and head to work or on top of make up if it is a fancier occasion (or bad breakout). As someone with oily yet sensitive skin I have a hard time finding face products and moisturizers that I like. Look no further, you have arrived.",1
no good  do not by,0
Remarkable product. It really does make your skin softer to touch and in appearance.,1
Garbage,0
"Fragrance is not listed in the ingredients, but the product definitely smells scented.  Other than that, I like how it lathers, and would have given it probably 4 stars.  So, if you are not sensitive to fragrances, give this a try.  BUT... If you are sensitive to fragrances, pass on this one, it may bother you.",0
Too oily for my hair.,1
"So when my old school tin cup of original Poetic Wax ran out I went through a series of cheap alternatives, one of which stripped my skin off & I had to take a day off of work because it looked so bad! *Note: I'm also using a prescription retina A product on my face which can cause hyper sensitivity, I used the precondition oil that comes with this kit first and had no problems at all*  That did it, I broke down & bought this new version.  I was very skeptical but it's the same wax, same gentle on skin but most effective on my baby fine but black upper lip hair! I gave it 4 stars only because I wish there were more product for the price however since I am dedicating this only for facial use, it will definitely last a year or longer! Way cheaper than the $5-10 lip wax at my salon!  It also can heat unevenly in the microwave.  Be very careful, I don't melt the whole cup, just get the sides a lil runny then scoop a tiny bit out , let it cool for a sec then spread it. If you're going to use it for other body parts, consider a different product, it'll work great but you'll go through it quickly and since other skin is less delicate than facial some of the cheaper waxes will be just fine.",1
"Have yet to see how this powder gives volume to your hair, worst purchase, and the size is like a sample.",0
"feels good. but i think my hair got way damaged, maybe its just that my hair beyond repair?",1
"Really great for dry skin! Cleanses my skin without drying it out, also my skin seems to be clearer ,but that changes often lol. I would use this for the double cleansing method though.. ( if you are looking for makeup removal)",1
"My hair is like latina curly.  I use this iron and it makes it soooo smooth and shiny for a week.  In fact it makes it so straight that I now have the courage to grow out my perm, and I now have roots that are about 8 inches long, and I have been able to manage the growth and make it seamless with the relaxed hair!  This is truly an amazing product and worth all the money!",1
I love the color. Better than a totally clear nail polish. It gives a natural look.,1
"I received a sample of this in my Ipsy bag this month, and have used it for a week. I break out very easily and have redness on my face from past acne, so I'm always very leery of trying something new on my face. I'm really glad I did, because this product leaves my skin feels soft and soothed and hasn't broken me out at all. I will definitely be buying this product soon as my sample is almost gone. The only thing I don't like about it is it smells SO STRONG that it literally hurts my nose and eyes and I hold my breath to keep from smelling it. Other than that, it's a great product.",1
"not verry good
thought my hair would grow it did not",0
love it,1
"This stuff has a ""candy like"" smell to it, not unpleasant at all.  Kind of vanilla-scented.  I line my lips with a pencil and swish some of the lipstick on my bottom lip and then press my lips together and use my finger to get it where I want it.  A little bit of gloss over that (either something with sparkle in it, or creamy depending on my mood), and it stays put a long time...or, it stays put until I eat something.  These liquid lipsticks really are very good at staying on my lips until I eat a lunch or dinner.  I usually put it on only once each day.  I think if I didn't wear gloss it might even endure a meal, but another daub of gloss after eating makes my lips look better.",1
"Received a sample of this after getting a haircut, and it works fairly well. However, it smells terrible. I'm not sure how to describe it but it must be similar to some toxic chemical. It is really gross and I had to throw it away.",0
I cannot always find this at the big box retailers or even some of the retail pharmacy stores so I not only can get it on Amazon but it is a little cheaper that way too!!!!,1
"After about a week of using, it kept shorting out and turning off every few seconds. Very annoying. Returned.",0
"I started seeing results after the first few weeks and continue to see greater lash retension and length, with no intention of stopping my usage!",1
"Best, fastest, most powerful hair dryer I have ever used in my life. Every time I use this dryer, I feel like I'm at the salon. The ceramic tech helps fight flyaways and dries hair fast without damaging it. I love using the cool button to really seal a hairstyle. Using this dryer, my hair goes from soaking wet to bone dry in under 10 minutes. Truly a time saver - worth every penny. Liked it so much I bought one for my mom, too!",1
"This product was beyond terrible. ""Hair building fiber""?!???!!!? Where was that fiber that was said on the label???  that is such a bs inaccurate product description. This didn't do anything my regular eyeshadow  can't do. To put this to test, I applied these ""hair building fibers"" on the left side of my temple area, my eyeshadow on the right side of the  temple area, the end result was better with my eyeshadow. Because with the eyeshadow, you have different color options thus resulting in more REAL and natural look you desire and the eyeshadow is also easier to apply. The eyeshadow trick to cover hairlines or parting area or anywhere you want more ""coverage"" etc does work. I was curious about this product and just wanted to give this a try and this failed miserably.  And the dozen listed  ingredients are not things that is good for u either (side note lol). Whenever i want an even healthier alternative to cover the balding on the temple area,  I just apply very thin layer of lotion and  charcoal!!!!! That also works. I put the product outside for UPS to pick up right away.",0
I got this based on a review of natural products.  I found it WAYYYY to thick when I put it on.  Shortly after I went into a wading pool and my legs turned white!  Yuck...I couldn't rub it in and had to wipe it all off.  I left it in the hotel when we departed.,0
"If you have patience, give this a try!  It truly gives you the same look as a blowout at a salon (after you get the hang of it).  Use it when your hair is about 70% dry and take your time doing small sections.  It takes some time but so does blowdrying with a round brush or using other hot tools after. I have very curly hair and thought this would get stuck while it spun but I was pleasantly surprised.  My hair came out silky & smooth with a little bounce, unlike using a flat iron. You'll be happy with your purchase!",1
Made me breakout but my friend loved it...,0
This is my third Elohim 2001 dryer. It is a great hairdryer. It dries the hair quickly and has the power to style my hair beautifully. I do find that this one is more noisier than my previous two.,1
I like the different combinations of settings that are possible.,1
Great but I picked too pale a ponk,1
If you have any wrinkles this is not for you!,0
"Very good detangler, but too expensive for daily use, dealer must go cheaper.",1
"For anyone with complaints about possibly getting fake Moroccan Oil online - my guess is it's factory related.

I purchased the shampoo, conditioner, and oil a few months ago at a salon - smells like heaven, so indulgent!

Then purchased the same items at the same salon today - smells/feels like completely different products with hardly any fragrance :(

In order to determine the differences - I tested the older vrs newer product on each hand, and the older product was clearly more fragrant. The smell/consistency on the newer was just off, not thick and creamy as before. I also noticed the older bottle states, 'made in Canada' - and the new states, 'made in Israel' ...which leads me to believe they have production in both places.

Therefore, this issue is not isolated to just orders placed online, but to salons as well, and, again, appears factory related.",0
"I really love the scent of this bodywash and I was glad to find it for a much better price. Usually I pay $22 for a 8.5 oz, this was $30 for 20 oz.",1
Doesn't remove much of anything don't love it like I do vichy lotions and moisturizers.,0
I send this perfume to my father as gift and he loved it! Very nice fragrance ;) he wear it when he go to his work!,1
"Barely covers, not up to what it was supposed to do",0
good products,1
"Performed okay when it was working. But the controls can be difficult to use if you have any lotion on your hands. The dryer stopped working after 6 months. The on/off switch was intermittent just prior to failing. I called customer service and they said they would send me a box to put it in. I called back 2 weeks later and then they apologized and said, no, I need to first send it to a different location and they would reimburse me for shipping.

I ended buying another dryer. This one is going in the trash. I don't want another one.",0
"I bought this kit as a Father's day gift for my boyfriend, and he absolutely LOVES it! I imagine he'll be getting a re-up on supplies next year too!",1
This product is extremely dying and spells like paint.  I am not sure if this is how the product is supposed to be but I am afraid to put it back on my hair after one use.  Will not buy again!,0
Just love this fragrance and glad to have it back in my collection again!!!!,1
Did not like the coverage.  Like Rita Haan better.,0
"This product was recommended by my dermatologist and I have used it for almost 4 weeks and I do not see any difference in my skin.  Perhaps, my expectations were too high, but I am not seeing the results.  The lotion has a nice feel to it, however, for the price I need to see some advantage.  I will finish the bottle and if there is a dramatic change, I will repost.  I will note, I have spoken to others who have used this product and have been pleased....",0
Protects without making your hair feel or look oily. Def recommend!,1
"I ordered dark brown and label says Dark Brown but it is in fact Blue Black. . Please resend the correct color and please check that the label is correct!
Thank you
Nina Gershuni",0
great product.,1
It is listed as No Returns but it arrived smashed?,0
Did not foam at all,0
"I have been ordering Obaji products through Amazon for several years and have always been happy with the products.  Unfortunately, I opened this container last week and found that it has a horrendous odor.  I've used this particular product for 5 years so I know it's not right and will not use it.  Unfortunately, I did not open it immediately and now it is several weeks past the authorized return date so I'm out nearly $100.00  I'm rethinking ordering Obagi through Amazon.
Would love to hear from someone at Amazon about this!",0
"I'm pretty sure I was sold a knock off in an authentic bottle. The spray cap is not like any of the others. It is cheap plastic and keeps trying to fall off. The smell, while similar, does not last the way any previous bottle has. Disappointed it took me this long to realize it.",0
Changed formula again. I HATE IT. This used to be my favorite it smelled like Right Guard. The mens type. This stinks. I have worn this for years. Not anymore,0
"Omg I have tried everything for my 6 week old daughter who had bad case of cradle cap in the front of her head. It was yellowish and it bothered me so much.. I tried everything from coconut oil, baby oil, even olive oil and nothing worked! This worked after just one use.. Today is our third time using and her head is clear. Will continue to use and definitely recommend",1
The sea salt had impurities that left black flecks all over my tub. :(,0
"Sure, I reside in a state where the sun only rears its warm, life-giving light 10% of the year (yay, Minnesota!), but when those golden beams do shine down, I attempt to absorb every last photon into my pasty, translucent skin. To transform my milky white epidermis into a breathtaking golden hue, I generally rely on the standard Banana Boat brand of various tanning gels and creams. But, wanting to expand the collection of half-used, expiring bottles of varying SPF in my bathroom cabinet, I thought I'd branch out and try the new Hampton Sun SPF 15 Tanning Gel. Here are my initial thoughts:

PROS:
* absorbs really well, leaving no sticky or greasy residue behind
* light, pleasant odor that won't attract bugs, nor repel the opposite sex (more perfumey than tropical)
* offers good protection, while still allowing for a nice tan to develop

CONS:
* the solution does not distribute well with the current spray cap, and tends to drip
* for a ""gel,"" it is very thin -- more like a cologne/perfume consistency
* might have to reapply the solution frequently, as it does not seem to last very long -- especially when sweating or swimming
* slightly irritating to the eyes, though not as much as my Sport Sunscreen
* COST

Overall, if you're looking for a new, unique tanning gel in a fairly attractive bottle, you can't go wrong with Hampton Sun. But, being the budget-conscious individual I am, I will likely stick with my trusty Banana Boat.",1
"You are supposed to twist the eyeliner to get it out of the tube, but mine won't come out when I twist it. It is also smudges VERY easily, which means it gets all over your lid pretty easily too throughout the day. I probably would not buy again.",0
The Princesses Rule color I have been using for years is a sparkly light pink.  What I got this time is a bright hot pink.  The numbers on the bottle are the same.  It can't be returned so be careful.,0
"this is wonderful stuff to give your hair volume. I have lots of hair, but very thin, so i am always looking for ways to get more volume. this stuff does the trick! no more perms for me.",1
"Dermablend Crme Warm Ivory Foundation Makeup with SPF 30 , 1 oz is easy to apply and covers well. Make sure you pick the proper color to match your skin tone. There is only one thing that they do not mention is that you need the setting powder to keep it from coming off. I used regular face powder and it did the job somewhat, but really the maker should alert buyers that the setting poweder is not an optional product but a needed one.

This product covers very well skin blemishes or other imperfections. I have heard from others that some women apply this and then put their regular foundation/concealer over it. There are many ways to use it. I am pleased with how it works and even let a friend try it and she liked the coverage.
This would be a 5 star product if the setting powder came with it, or was at least made known you had to have it.",1
"Received 2 bottles of Essie Nail Polish ""Hubby for Dessert"" color today. This color was a ""limited edition"" bridal color I got about a year ago, so when I saw it was available on Amazon, I quickly bought 2 because I love the color. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL AUTHENTIC ESSIE COLOR. I bought the original bottle of this nail polish in this shade (Hubby for Dessert) at a CVS and I can verify it is Essie (see top bottle in photo and the clear difference in color). However, the two bottles I received from Amazon (2 bottom bottles in photo) are NOT the same color, much ""pinker.""

Not sure if these are ""knock-offs""- beware you might not get the correct shade despite color name being the same! This color is OK, and it's too much of a hassle to return, so I will keep, but I am very disappointed, as it is NOT the correct color at all.",0
Parfums are very subjective but this one should appeal to a wide range.  The scent evokes English countryside parties to my mid.  A discreet and classy scent.  I will note that it had a strong scent after first applying but eventually settled into a discreet scent and not over powering as first feared. My only complaint is a minor one - I hated the clunky top.,1
Very clumpy would never recommend or buy again! Too much money for a horrible product,0
"Not impressed for amount of money. I have naturally curly hair and it just made my hair heavy so my curls looked bad. My hair was soft, thats the only good thing, but my styling products didn't work as well with it.",0
OK,1
After two applications my skin broke out in red itchy bumps and it had taken several days for them to abate. I am very disappointed.,0
"I have coarse hair. Very disappointed in product,  i would give it a 4 out of 10. when I workout and my hair gets sweaty it starts to frizz.  It also has bad smell.  I don't like the texture of my hair now.  In the past I have always used matrix opti smooth with excellent results and will never change again.",0
Seems to be working.,1
This curling iron is great. I watched and read reviews before I purchased and it did not disappoint.,1
I returned this product and it has yet to be replaced.  It was defective and I'm still waiting for the replacement.,0
"This is a mysterious, woodsy fragrance.  I like it so much I want to order all products available in ""Black Forest""...very calming, very unique.",1
"love this scent, masculine and exotic",1
Great color and consistency and it lasts for weeks! Amazing product!,1
"I have been looking for non-toxic beauty products and I thought this kit was a good value to try. I really love the products, and I have to say that I can clearly see an improvement in my skin. It's brighter and more even toned, and I feel like I need less makeup now, after just a few weeks. I haven't even tried the mask yet. The antioxidant serum is the star of this show for me. I've already reordered the regular size. I would have given the kit 5 stars, but while the cleansing milk is nice, it doesn't do a great job of removing my eye makeup, and I really only wear mascara... It leaves me with major raccoon eyes and I have to go back in with eye makeup remover. Bottom line, if you are looking to try Juice Beauty, the kit is a great value and you may see noticeable improvement in your skin.",1
This spray has the best scent. I get many compliments. The only thing is it doesn't hold well but again I only use it for the scent.,1
"Nothing special. Didn't feel moisturizing or anything, at all.",0
Don't like it,0
"A girlfriend of mine told me how wonderful this eyeliner is and urged me to try it. I don't have very good luck with eyeliner going on smoothly and staying on all day, so ... even though it's much more expensive than I usually buy ... I decided to try it. It's just ""ok."" Goes on about the same as other liners I've tried; isn't any darker; doesn't stay on any better. I'll probably buy a less expensive product in the future.",1
This is a big bottle for the price! I love how clean and clear it helps my skin! I have used many different types of skin cleaners and this is defiantly one of the best so far for me. Totally worth the price!,1
"I have very dry, curly hair and this is a watery rinse, not a conditioner for it. Too expensive for just a masculine hair scent.",0
Ok so I got this a little wile ago and because it was so expensive I kept using it hoping to see it work but honestly it sucks. For 1 it's PAINFULL. I mean all peal off masks hurt at least a little. But this one omg! Second it just doesn't work. If you have larger pores it will I guess separate? It will go around the hole but won't go over no matter how much you put on. 99% of the time I use this I end up using a pore strip and getting the same results as if I never used the mask. The pain is not worth the lack of results. Seriously wish I could get my money back.,0
Wonderful product for thicker hair.  Very pleasant tea tree scent.  Gave it to my husband to try and he uses it now.,1
"I have used many flat irons in the past.  This is my first BaByliss.  It heated up quickly, which was nice. However, the outside blue shell on got so hot it burned me.  I cannot hold it past the bottom handle.  When holding a flat iron we hold from several areas on the outside.  It should not burn you. I tried to hold it only from the bottom, but my habit to hold it a bit higher behind the lower part of the plates kept burning me.  I am returning this.  I don't know if this is a flaw in the product or this particular model.",0
Awesome,1
I am a stylist and feel like this product doesn't get hot enough.,0
"Does not match the same quality of product I've bought before - very sticky, as if the can was stored improperly.",0
"Had to return, wouldnt heat up.",0
"I'm writing this review while making a truly side-by-side comparison of Dermablend Liquid Camo Foundation, Shade Cream 10N on the back of my left hand, and my usual ""Age Defying"" makeup Shade Natural Beige 35  (don't want to mention the brand) on my right hand.  The colors are very similar, with the Dermablend being slightly lighter in color.  The big difference is the amount of coverage achieved after I've smoothed the two products on my hands.  The Dermablend provides a MUCH higher level of masking of freckles (sometimes called age spots); I can barely see the darkness of the veins in my hand.  On my right hand, I have an even effect of the shade, but my veins are more their natural shade and seem more prominent.  Coverage is a good quality.  The disappointing part is that on my left hand with the Dermablend seems to emphasize the lines on my hand, while my present product lightly fills the lines in and appears to be smoother.  The heavier coverage Dermablend has more ""texture,"" a make-up artist word, than the lighter-weight product.  Choosing cosmetics is a function of taste.  A person with a young, smooth face may want the heavier coverage to provide a palette for other products on cheeks and eyes.  For an older woman who already has plenty of ""texture"" on her face, the high-coverage product may be the wrong choice.  The Dermablend is soft on my skin and does not seem to burn my face, although I've avoided my eyes.",1
Waste of money no change in skin tone . Overpriced!!!!,0
I haven't found the spray to be very effective for my hair. It definitely doesn't mimic the look after I get out of the ocean. The best use I found for it was as a refresh on non wash days. I did like the smell.,0
"Feels Amazing, my girlfriend got me hooked on it a while back. But, after doing some research and noticing some changes to my skin, we realized that some of the ingredients can be very harmful. Mainly, fragrance/parfum and phenoxyethanol, *a potential neurotoxin and common allergen, were of great concern. Maybe if it was more natural and eco friendly, I would give it 5 stars. Before learning about the harsh chemicals found in this product, I was very pleased with it.",0
My son used it for a month and we have seen no change.,0
"For the price, this hair dryer performs like it's much more expensive. It really does a great job of keeping frizz down - works so much better than the drugstore one I had been using. Trust me, you don't realize how much of a difference a hair dryer can make until you try a great one. Would definitely recommend!",1
"I bought this eyeliner in cobalt blue because I wanted to use my $5.00 credit from choosing regular Prime shipping.  Even with my credit, the Stila eyeliner cost me $18.00. I followed Stilas suggestions and shook the liner before use.  I had trouble applying the liner because hardly any product came out to the tip or the top points sides. Id used a similar product from LOreal with no problems at all.  Try the LOreal eyeliner instead because it comes in a lovely blue, works better and costs less!",0
I love the light smell of this perfume. I receive many compliments when I wear it. Will purchase again.,1
"Most of the time the clipper shuts off on its own ,never over charged ! Really dissapointed ",0
IT SMELLS REALLY BAD. GAVE ME A HEAD AKE AFER I USED IT.  WOUOLD NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN.  I JUST KEEP IN IN THE GUEST BATHROOM HOPING MY GUEST WILL USE IT BECAUSE I WILL NOT. IT MADE ME SICK.  THE ARE MANY OTHER BRANDS THAT SMALL MUCH BETTER.  I REALLY LIKE RED DOOR. ZERO STARS,0
"Ok, this shampoo has a great smell and cleanses your hair very well. A little drop of shampo makes a huge lather, so less is more. I gave it 2 stars because it drys your hair out SO BAD!! I mean your hair will be bone dry, and there is no shine or luster either! I would prob recommend this hair care product for anyone that has extremely oily hair - otherwise, save yourself the trouble.",0
"I was recommended this from my dermatologist who promised this was an amazing sunscreen for my skin. After using it for a few days my skin began to peel and flake, become inflamed and break out. I switched to Neutrogena ""No Break Out"" 55 SPF (for half the price) and my skin has been thrilled at the change. For $20 I was incredibly disappointed by this product.",0
"The color does not match the picture (I compared on two different screens). I expected it to be a pearl with pink tint but instead it is a dull light beige that  looks like dirty white when dried on my nails. The item is not eligible for returns, so it goes  right into the trash can.",0
Had high hopes for this wand but was quickly deceived. I have straight thin hair and tried this iron for a month straight on the highest heat setting. My hair would not keep the curl. Had better results with my cheap Walmart Conair curling iron. Super sad this iron didn't work out.,0
it was a gift,1
After using a couple time its already got a hole in it. So disappointed,0
"I was very excited reading reviews for this product, however I have not after a few week found any improvement. I will hope that a few more weeks may see something more hopeful from my $65 purchase. I would not recommend this costly product to a friend. Sorry !",0
Really??? It's only about a tablespoon of product in a 2 inch tube.  A rip-off. Not enough product for the price unless you are bald.,0
"great product, nice close shave!",1
nice!,1
Like some of the MB products but not this one.  Feels sticky & doesn't seem to absorb.,0
"I have bi-racial hair which means I am always in a constant flux with how to manage it. I have found that round brushing when doing a blow out doesn't work for my very long curly hair. I much prefer to use the straightening pik or comb attachment with a hair dryer and then flat iron. There are not very many hair dryers like that on the market except ones specifically geared towards my demographic (if you know what I mean). So, this hair dryer fit the bill. When I received the package I initially tested it out and the first thing I noticed was the awesome comb attachment. It is made of durable plastic and the pik's teeth are thick and seem to be well constructed. I don't think you'll have a problem with comb breaking at all. Now as for the hair dryer itself, it is a fail. The hair dryer is a very pretty red color and is relatively quiet but its very awkward to hold in your hands for a long period of time. It felt like my hands were sliding off of the handle, not to mention the control buttons are right on the area where you would hold the dryer - definitely annoying. The hair dryer also doesn't seem to get very hot. I need major heat and this was just so-so. I had an Andis dryer before and while my Andis is only 1875 watts it seemed to get my hair much more straighter. I have now purchased the Allure 2200 Watt Hair Dryer sold here on amazon http://www.amazon.com/Allure-2200w-Professional-Ionic-Ceramic/dp/B00SKQFT4I and it has worked surprisingly well for me. My drying time has went down to only 12 minutes. Plus the comb attachment from the Hot Tools dryer fits perfectly on this one. Score!",0
"I was looking forward to receiving this because it did get great reviews.  I thought it smelled like a floral Noxzema, was not happy at all with the fragrance of this product.,",0
Did better with disposable shavers.  I expected more.,0
"meh....... Sorry for my bad reviews on any other Mario Badescu line of products....After using this as well as other products from this brand for a month, I saw ZERO effects from using this cream. I rather slather NIVEA (from Germany) under my eye and see much much better result next morning.",0
"I have long thick hair.  I had another set of rollers that I used before these but I started to notice that the curl would come out very quickly.  I was absolutely shocked when these appeared at our home, my husband and purchased them for me as a surprise. They are really the best curlers ever.  There are 4 different sizes.  I get a ton of compliments on my hair, and the curl stays in all day.",1
did not make any difference for me :/,0
Very nice moisturizing cream for the neck area without being too heavy. I will buy this again.,1
"I normally love this mascara and buy it from here often, but for some reason the tube I got was either old or not sealed properly. It dried out and clumped within a week of receiving it. Not good for a $20+ mascara that is normally very high quality.",0
umm don't know what to say..not working,0
I liked it for a long time but then it started to sting my face so I had to stop using it,0
My new favorite! Great price!,1
"Not waterproof, but so far great. I need to wear a waterproof one if I go in the pool, and if I were caught in the rain. When you rinse it off, it looks as if all your eyelashes are falling out. Fortunately a friend uses it and informed me AFTER the fact that it comes off in ""tubes"" so it looks like hair. Makes lashes long and thick appearing!",1
Stopped working a few months later,0
Kind of waxy feeling.,0
Great night cream. Love the texture!,1
Still on the fence worked great for the coarser hair in the bikini region but legs almost felt razor burnt but very smooth now. Hoping that a new razor will help this issue. But for smell smoothness and great performance on coarser hair a solid 4 stars,1
"I've used this product for several years and I love it, almost as effective as Botox without the frozen look.",1
I received this wrapping lotion frozen. the liquid in the bottle looke like water.,0
When I received this product the lid had opened and the shampoo was all over the place.  Very disappointed.,0
"Seriously, I love this stuff. It is by far my favorite men's product. Moisturizes well, lathers well, and smells incredible - kind of a sweet tobacco smell. I've used 1821's hair clay, which has the same smell, and overall I'm incredibly happy with their products. I haven't used it as a shampoo, but think it would likely be fine for most guys. Seriously, if you're looking for a new men's product to try, make it 1821. My wife turned me on to it and I only use their stuff now.",1
"I USE SEVERAL OF JANE IREDALE PRODUCTS AND HAVE BEEN HAPPY WITH THEM.  THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I TRIED THIS UNDER EYE CONCEALER.  FOR ME, NOT THAT GREAT.  NOT AS MUCH COVERAGE AS YOU MIGHT LIKE.  THE BRUSH APPLICATOR FEELS NICE BUT YOU REALLY NEED YOUR FINGER TO PUT IT ON.  LIGHT COVERAGE AND I FELT IT WAS MORE OF A UNDER EYE HIGHLIGHTER THAN TO BE USED FOR COVERAGE.",0
Not a fan.... not a good fragrance for me!,0
A great curling iron!,1
"A complete wast of $16. Its literally like applying cream cheese to your armpits. Even when I try to lightly apply it, it leaves the white thick streak of white residue and clumps up thru out the day. I have never had any other deodorant do this and unfortunately I can't see myself using this ever again or maybe so its not a total waste of money Ill use it to the gym when I wear tank tops. You can literally feel this stuff on your pits. ugh!!!!",0
"This device uses an electrical microcurrent to stimulate your facial muscles. Thankfully you don't feel anything other than a mild tingling sensation due to the included gel (which is ridiculously overpriced to buy alone, however). I like the fact that you don't need to do more than five minutes per day and the device is small enough to take with you on a trip, so you don't have to miss any treatments while traveling.

I have crow's nest wrinkles by my eye, but you can't use it too close to that area - instead I had to use it further down below, around my cheekbone area and move it gently upward. After two weeks, my jowls appear to be sagging less and look tighter, the way they did when I was younger. I'm pretty pleased with this effect, though it hasn't done that much for the wrinkles around my eyes - the effect is very subtle, not a big improvement.

Overall, I'm cautiously optimistic. I'll keep using it past the two week mark and will post an update if I see any noticeable improvement.",1
Light weight.  The lid over the air vent wouldn't stay on.,0
"I would have rated it higher but the smell was over-whelming.  At first it seemed to smell good, but after waiting for mask to dry it was unbearable.  I love smelly stuff but this was just too much!!!",0
Nozzle broken up on opening 12$ down the tubes,0
This didn't really do anything for me.,0
A tangle mess!,0
This product is very good and a little bit goes a long way.  I have some now and would purchase it again!,1
"I was so excited for this product, since I have fair skin and putting on sunscreen under makeup makes it oily and then I have to reapply over the makeup anyways. I used this 4 times and it worked well and then the sprayer broke and I haven't been able to use it again. So I have a 3/4 full bottle of product that I should wasted unless I spend serious time trying to make it work again.",0
This stopped working after six months.  No return possible.  What a rip off!!!,0
good,1
"This is the best stuff for your Keratosis Pilaris. Works mechanically and chemically. I used up one jar and didn't have problems for a couple years. Just bought it again. I don't use the cream, I prefer a lactic acid product.",1
Hope my hair doesn't fall out.  I read all the reviews about these products,0
"I have struggled for years with my face breaking out when putting sunscreen on my face.  Also with finding a sunscreen that wouldn't run into my eyes.  I t's great in moisturizers but does not have enough SPF in the ones that I have tried.  Not the case with Coola Classic Sport Face! It smells great, it's non-greasy, doesn't go into my eyes, and has 50 SPF! I threw this size in my purse to put on if I am getting  a little more sun than usual in a day or going to the pool.  I would buy more but it is pretty pricey and not available in many stores.",1
"The color is a cool blue, with no leanings toward green. It has a subtle sparkle. Not so much to look juvenile, just to give it more dimension and depth. I found it to be a very thick formula, and was difficult to smooth out. When I first started applying, it looked a bit clumpy. I shook it longer and that helped, but a mini model paint shaker would probably work best. I got full coverage with one coat, but the second added depth and dimension. I would love to see comments about how you layered it. Overall good, just not as easy to apply as other shades. It will be my  go-to shade for summer.",1
"Makeup comes off so easily. I love it so much and know that if anything did happen where it was misplaced or messed up, i would just buy a new one. It has become that invaluable.",1
Too shiny for a mature woman,0
"I've worn Elizabeth Arden's Red Doors for yrs &sadly,  it's true that apparently the formula must have changed. I have a small travel bottle of the ""old"" formula that is still the most commented upon fragrance I've ever worn, by both women & men. Sooooo disappointed in the newbie purchase.....smells like gardenias & my girlfriends agree. Way too floral for my taste. Goodbye, old friend & favorite, Red Door.",0
"The product didn't work well on my skin, but the purchase and delivery were perfect.",0
I felt like it straightened the hair well but I didn't really see a difference between this one and the gold and hot one I have,0
"I am 39, AA, with oily, acne-prone skin. I don't have any wrinkles or fine lines, but I do have dry feet and dry hands. I have used this twice at night, but it is too oily for my skin. However, I LOVE the way it smells and it has a thick consistency. So, onto my feet it goes!",1
"Hated the color, it looks pink but it`s almost white.",0
"Natural rose geranium aroma, and feels very refreshing going on. IT is a strong natural perfume, but even I find it pleasant and usually I cannot stand perfumes.  I have not noticed any miracle changes in my skin, but I like using it. And I am a woman-I did not realize this was a ""men's"" product. Not that it matters.",1
"This stuff stopped my hair loss, kept my bald spot from getting bigger and even reduced the size of it. Everybody's hair situation is different but this will work for some people.",1
"Although I bought this item on QVC I want to let you know about my experience as this is a considered purchase.  I  received this same item yesterday-charging took 17 hours but was not worried. I used it today and followed their booklet instructions to the letter and also watched their video on how to use.  My ""treatment"" took around 10 minutes for me to complete all areas as I was unfamiliar with this device.  The booklet suggested the device could be kept I plugged in.  I checked back around 10 hours later and noticed it was still charging.  I called NuFACE and left a message and also called QVC.  QVC agreed it seemed a long time to recharge and suggested I call the manufacturer. I do have a return policy that I am confident will be honored.  Please beware as this is a considered expense.",0
"Foams up great, but the consistency is variable...not sure if thats a problem or not.",1
best for curly hair,1
Buyer beware.. This shade is a very light pink . The picture to me I thought would be more in the natural / brown family but it its more of a straight pink on the lips . Wasn't for me ! Gave it two stars because I LOVE Lorac products ...,0
Didn't like color at all,0
"Rollers are a little too hot, they burn my scalp when they touch. They're also heavy & tend to fall out when I move my head.",1
"Smells like a vacation! This is my ""special"" sunscreen.",1
"Smears, and runs super easy. Embarrassing to wear.",0
The Pads were very dry. I wasted my money.,0
"I do not believe this was an authentic Chi purchase. I also compared the bottles that I purchased from this seller to the ones that I purchased from Amazon/Ulta directly and they are different types of plastic, feeling of shampoo is different. Really bummed that I can't trust that it was authentic product.",0
Color did not meet my expectation.,0
"I am posting this to hopefully help anyone reading tons of reviews on flat irons. I saw so many glowing reviews on the Babyliss pro nano titanium and was super excited to try it on my coarse, thick, color treated and relaxed hair. I had used the HAI  (black and blue one) for 10 years and wanted to try a new one out. This straightened really well, but after a few weeks I noticed the ends of my hair (especially in the front) was so dry, frazzled and damaged looking :( Then you need to flat iron it to make it look better, which damages it worse. I am now shelling out another $100 for a new flat iron and getting the ends of my hair trimmed. I would not recommend this, not worth the damage to the ends, that doesnt look good.",0
"Good product, but it is very strong.  I use it twice a week.",1
Feel it makes a difference...,1
very clumpy on the lashes,0
"I bought this because I bought the spin air brush by conair, I figured this would work. It didn't unfortunately because my hair is a little long and it didn't put out enough air. I gave it to my mom and she seems to like it alot. I would recommend this for short hair, pretty short and maybe fine hair!",1
Does not smell like Wen. Does not feel like Wen. Does not work like Wen. I don't think it's actually a Wen product.,0
Great product,1
Horrible,0
The smell of this deodorant is too strong for my taste. I just couldn't get past it. I would not purchase this product again.,0
As others have stated I LOVED this flat iron but it also stopped working after a little over a year. I only used it for special occasions (so maybe used a dozen times).,0
"Only use occasionally figuring I have years to remove what is left after professional use; then the machine stopped working. I haven't reached out to the company yet to see if they will replace it, but hoping they will.",0
"This was gunky and made my hair heavy and stiff. I only used a small amount (a few squirts) on damp hair as directed. I wanted a coconut smell, but this didn't even smell right. I'm going back to my Garnier Fructose Marvelous Oil.",0
"This shaving cream works exceptionally well, delivering a wonderfully smooth and clean shave. The lather is very rich, certainly one of the best I've used. However, I do not like the smell. It's nice, but smells somewhat of handsoap. I'd prefer something more fragrant, like the C.O. Bigelow eucalyptus shaving cream I've found elsewhere. I prefer the tingle of the eucalyptus in the C.O.B. product, even though the lather isn't quite as rich.

I'll gladly finish this tube of shaving cream, but next time I think I'll look for a different Proraso variety.",1
"I really like this mascara. I found myself wearing mascara much more often because of this product. It goes on smooth and easy. ""Mistakes are easily whiped away while the product is still wet. Once dry it's completely smudgeproof. Nice natural look which is great for every day use. The thing I love about this mascara is that it washes away with soap and water. The ""tubes"" come off easily and cleanly with little effort. No makeup remover needed and my favorite part, no residues whatsoever!!  Hate the smudge and hate having to use make up remover to scrub it off. None of that with this mascara. I gave it only 4 star because if you are looking for really looking long or really full lashes, this isn't for you. But if you want natural lashes for an every day look, this is for you.",1
I experience my first shave 20 years ago with the Art of Shaving and will never use anything else. I hate to shave. The Art of Shaving shave products are the best.,1
"Very pleased to get my luxury sample box. It was a nice black and white box filled with most of the samples as pictured. This is a great deal for someone who wants to use the credit in luxury beauty. I really liked the Ahava water hand cream and the Julep nail polish. Can't wait to try the Mavis toothpaste and some of the other skin care samples. I received a Jane Iredale primer, a Cindy Crawford skin care, and much more. I've attached a pic of what I received. This is comparable to any subscription box in the price range, and you get the credit for a purchase, too.  I only received one sample that was for a man, the Eternity for men cologne, which I will give to a friend. I know some people were complaining that received too many men's samples, but I didn't find that to be the case at all.",1
It's a great product from The Balm,1
"The barrel is too big for my hair length. Unfortunately I ordered two of them, one for me and one for my mom.",0
This sunscreen is just as oily as most body sunblocks.  I was really hoping for better as several people said it was non-oily.  What a lie.  There are better face sunscreens that cost half as much and can be bought at any store.,0
"Merkur makes a beautiful razor, no doubt about it.  But in mine and literally hundreds of cases, the chrome begins to flake off very quickly and the metal corrodes.  Merkur will not stand behind the product.  When contacted, Merkur responded by blaming my water:

""Thank you very much for your email and the link to the photos.

The corrosion your razors show is part of the normal wear and tear that occurs

especially in areas with poor water quality and/or a high concentration of chemicals in the tap water.

I am sorry for not being able to give you more favorable news.

Best regards....""

These are not expensive razors but their reputation for quality is undeserved and they don't give a crap.",0
"I purchased this along with the B.J. Beard Wash after purchasing a few other Billy Jealousy products which I loved. This on the other hand does nothing good for your beard. The product is creamy, has a decent smell to it and applies easily. That's about the only positives this product has. It softened my beard for only about 10 minutes after applying, then it dries my beard out like crazy. Stiff, rigid and completely untouchable, which is not something you want when your woman expects certain things from you! This was the worst product I've ever used that was supposed to control and condition your beard. You will be much better off going with a higher quality beard balm such as Honest Amish, Wild Willie's or Mad Viking's line of beard balms. Do yourself a favor and skip trying this!",0
this arrived opened and spilled all over the box.. unsatisfied. will not buy again.,0
excellent if you need hair repair...this is the stuff,1
terrible stuff,0
"The ease of application, the lovely color and from a brand I like made me immediately like this eyeshadow crayon. That changed in about 10 minuets, when I looked in a mirror and saw my eyes were a raccooned mess.
Nothing I did or used, moisturized, primers, dry, could get this eye crayon to stay on my lid without smudging, shifting and all but disappearing, except for a greasy mess in my crease.
I have very normal eye lids, I have always enjoyed exceptionally long wear time for almost all my eye makeup, so this is a serious surprise and disappointment.
I would not recommend, or repurchase.",0
been using this for years not an easy product to find,1
"Discovered this oil while cruising, and I love it.  It is not oily but leaves skin feeling soft and moist. I think my skin looks better.  It feels great!",1
"The only reason I do not like it, is because I CANNOT get used to using it since there is no way to hold the hair. It doesn't have the additional clip that holds hair in place to curl. :(

I know it is just me and I am tech challenge, but can any one recommend how to use it. I want to return it but my daughter won't let me and it was too expensive to hate it because I cannot use it or rather don't know how.",0
"I'm not in love with this sunscreen but I like it for what it is. First impression: it's not a cream, it's fluid - some people don't like this, I don't mind because it means you don't need very much (a little really does go a long way) and it also absorbs quickly. This isn't a moisturizer. I've been using it without a moisturizer and it's just not enough. I recommend using it on top of an oil or cream if your skin is on the dry side - I started using coconut oil. Something strange about this product is how it reacts to salt. Sometimes I'll add baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) to my cleansers for a mild exfoliation or to my tooth paste for extra whitening. I always know when I haven't rinsed everything off my face after I apply the sunscreen because it turns my skin a bright yellow in my hair line and corners of my mouth - it's the strangest thing. The same thing happens if you cry, so if you plan on going to a sad film, wear waterproof mascara and use a different sunscreen. Something I like about this product is how it brightens the skin - I have fair skin and it's almost always blotchy but I hate wearing makeup. I wouldn't go so far as to call this a BB cream, but it helps to even my complexion when on. I'm not sure what the effect would be on darker complexions though, I know some sunscreens can give a ""gray"" appearance when applied. So if you're not melanin challenged like I am, I would find this at a Target* and test it out before purchasing.

*Target retailers sell some of the La Roche-Posay line and some of the products have testers. I used the testers to see if I liked the texture then bought it on Amazon after wards. If you're not a fan of returning things by mail, I'd check out a Target to see of you can test it out before committing.",1
It lasted less than 1 year before it stopped working.,0
It took a whole month to get here.  Then it smells like old lady's perfume.  I like Rituals Samurai Sword better.  Not bad but not my type either.,0
scent lasts about 20 minutes tops...,0
Didn't see any difference in my hair.,0
This is seriously my favorite cleanser of all time - and I've tried a lot of them! :),1
"it was too light, and coverage was poor.",0
"This facial cleanser is great. Small, packable and makes my skin feel smooth and soft. I got it in november 2016 and the battery literally lasted for weeks. Unfortunately something has happened to the battery and it doesn't hold its charge anymore so I have to charge it after every use. I have taken extremely good care of it keeping it in a dry place, washing it after every use (used it once a day).

After doing some research several other people has had this problem with Clarisonic and the fact that it is not possible to change battery makes this the worst $200 I have spent in a good while.",0
EVERYTHING !! TERRIBLE PRODUCT. THOUGHT I WOULD TRY A NEW BRAND BUT I WILL STICK TO MY CHANEL AND REVLON.,0
"Can't decide if this product makes my hair look the same or worse, leaning towards worse. Also, for the ridiculous price, I got a very small bottle that I used 4-5 times and then it was empty. Which was not totally a bad thing because I was really disappointed with this product and would never buy again.",0
"The only reason I am giving this 4, instead of 5 stars, is that it's a real pity that it contains just 2,5% niacinamide, and not 5%.",1
"This worked for me. You should know that this is a foam. It suggest using an amount the size of a walnut, I would suggest a small walnut. It worked immediately to take the sting out of my cracked heel. I have been using it daily as maintenance and it has helped a good bit. It is very to use and does dry almost immediately which is a big plus. I have had no problem with any residue showing up on any of my designer shoes.
I would recommend and purchase again.",1
Got this for my wife based on the other reviews.  She says it's the best dryer she ever used and gives her hair salon quality looks.  It's a little heavier than other dryers but worth it.,1
"What a disappointment! I have been a fan of La Roche-Posay products for many years and was very much looking forward to trying out this new cleanser. But here is what I found:

- Cleansing power is average, not good, not bad, and so is the slightly dry feeling after product usage.

- The company says that it has a ""unique cooling effect for a refreshing, pure feel"". While I did notice a slight cooling effect, I don't think that it amounted to much at all. I definitely expected something stronger than just a very mild and very fleeting cool feeling.

- But what really, really made me dislike this product is that it is heavily fragranced (at least to my nose). I wouldn't say anything if this were Lancome or Estee Lauder - both companies that seem to use a lot of fragrance in their products. But this is La Roche-Posay - a company that advertises products for sensitive skin and calls itself the dermatologists' brand! In the product description on their website they describe it as being ""Soap-free, Alcohol-free, Paraben-free, Safe for sensitive skin"". What they forgot to mention is that they added tons of fragrance to this. While the product rinses off ok, the fragrance does not and I could not wait to use some toner to wipe off every trace of this smell that was way too intense for me and that I plain hated.

While I will continue to love&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Roche-Posay-Toleriane-Fluid-1-35-Ounces/dp/B000IO6NFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Roche-Posay Toleriane Fluid  1.35-Ounces</a>&nbsp;precisely because it is fragrance-free and just all-around great for sensitive skin, I am still wondering what La Roche-Posay was thinking when they came up with this Cleansing Gel. It simply does not fit their brand philosophy nor does it smell good at all.",0
Not sure why I don't like this anymore...did they change the formula was Onesta bought out?  doesn't seem the same.,0
"My husband and I both use this. Love the smell, you feel hydrated after spraying it and I feel that it keep my skin soft and moisturized. Almost out so buying again.",1
This leaves  your hair really damaged and their return policy is really bad. Completely unsatisfied,0
"I have used Leonor Greyl honey shampoo for years, and have been an enthusiastic fan. However, my most recent purchase was of a number of bottles all of which seem diluted. The previously thick shampoo was watery; consequently one needed to use much more of it. I do not know if this happened to be a bad batch; whether it had been tampered with along the way; or whether Greyl is using a new, much less effective formula.",0
Been using this product for a while. Agree with other reviews that this lot is significantly watered down,0
"Young or old, not every cream works on every skin type, so you have to try several in order to find what's right for you. I've tried many many moisturizing products from the very cheap to extremely expensive including Dr. Perricone's line and was not impressed with the results. I was introduced to the NIA 24 products while undergoing microdermabrasion treatments on my face. Many of my friends who regularly visit dermatologists and cosmetologists are told to use the NIA line, and like it. Until I found this product, I was just using the NIA 24 Recovery Complex, which is good stuff. After finishing the microdermabrasion, I started chemical facials peels at home, and needed more intensive moisturizing. Later I discovered Prescriptives Intensive Rebuilding Moisturizer which is really great stuff too even though it's a bit pricey. I didn't know that Nia24 Intensive Recovery Complex existed until I shopped on-line for the Recovery Complex. I found the NIA Intensive at a good price, tried it, and barring the expense, am very satisfied with Nia24 Intensive Recovery Complex. I alternate it with the Prescriptives Intensive Cream because sometimes my skin ""get used"" to a product, and needs a change (like alternating shampoos). I can wear this product under my water-based make-up during the day, and use it at night. It's not greasy, absorbs quickly into the skin and stays with you all day. If the skin is damaged, it doesn't ""burn."" Does it make my skin look great? It's never been my experience that creams alone will do that, regardless of your age. I'm using chemical peels to clean my skin and remove imperfections (I need to find a really great cleanser, but haven't found one yet.) My skin looks great because it's clean and clear (I've never smoked nor do I worship the sun and I'm a social drinker!) If your skin is clean and clear, having the right moisture level makes the skin glow. Then you don't need to wear foundation. I would recommend this product if your skin is dry, very dry, damaged, and/or has fine lines. Hope this helps you to make the right decision for you.",1
Have used Nioxin 6 for the last 1.5 years. This one feels watered down.,0
I have used this product before but this container of self tanner did not foam. It looked like green mud and instantly turned my hands dark brown. I washed my hands several times then finally used Dawn detergent to get it off.,0
Great setting spray! Does not water my makeup!,1
"It's very lightweight and easy to glide on skin. Offers a great coverage. My only issue, perhaps mostly because of the sunscreen ingredients, is that it has a shine to it, so I don't like to use a lot of it all over my face. Other than that, it's a very nice foundation. It's not greasy at all. I don't have any breakouts from it. It also offers a great coverage for redness and sunspots.",1
Love this product,1
"Love the wand, work great. However the glove was not in the package...",1
"What can I say? It really works!! It smells like fresh clay and after a night's sleep, the blemishes are significantly reduced :D... I have terrible skin typically, however ever since I started using all these products it's become significantly better... Go Mario Badescu!",1
Love this stuff!! Wish I would have found this year's ago ...it would have saved me tons of money !!!,1
I got Lacoste as a gift for my son and he loves it.,1
"i  smell  the scent of a flower along with nutmeg and a greenish scent  which i recogmized as vetiver,oh the flowered scent that o recognize is  the same one i smell in the edt of mont blancs,""presence""  that of heliotrope. the vetiver is more evident later on.",1
"Great fragrance, good price",1
I'm just staring to use this on a regular basis... so far it feels like it is tightening.,1
"Being a regular customer of Perlier's Co, I have been using their bath line since 2006. I ordered it because is lavender which I love. It is a good bath gel with a pleasant smell ,unisex. It's from Italy. Good also for babies or hyper children to calm them down or after a long day  at work , will make you feel really good.",1
Left white residue in my dark hair.,0
"The Vincent Longo primer gave me a smooth and matte base using very little product. After applying my foundation, the finish result made my skin appear flawless and my foundation stayed in place for hours without any touch ups. A great product to have.",1
WOW!  Great product.,1
"The polish pooled at the base of the nail.  Although a very nice color, my nails looked terrible.  Could not wait to remove it.  I have been using cnd for a very long time.  What happened?",0
"The lotion as it is applied is not bad but if you want to put any other lotion or make-up on top of it, it flakes off",0
"Easy to use stick concealer. My wife likes the stick concealer as its she does not have to a pour then dab the concealer on her face. However, this also means that she has to blend it better as it is more 'cakey than the more liquid ones.'",1
too greasy for my skin,0
The best eye cream ever. I got a sample and just loved it and the price is great. I have used so many expensive creams and this is better than all of them. My concealer goes on so smoothly with this product and it really does smooth out the lines.  I can use this product day or night I just use a good shadow base and get no creasing.  And under eyes stays nice and moisturized throughout the day.  I have used all kinds of different eye products that are far more expensive  and the best results I've gotten is combining this eye cream with Peter Thomas Roth laser free eye serum.,1
way smaller then i thought,0
A great product. I'm still getting use to using it but I'm thinking it deserves  4 1/2 stars!,1
Great product and it came in a little early which was great,1
"This did not work well for me, even with the spray applicator.  Too much money for something that really didn't do the job.",0
This product is a must have. I've been using this for years to add tons of volume to a simple curled look:) (be aware that a little does go a long way though),1
"I've had my own uv lamp for a while, so with trial and error, I have learned a thing or two about the process of giving myself a uv manicure. One thing that is essential is that you must wipe your nails with rubbing alcohol between EVERY layer (every time you cure). Once before you start, once after your base, after the color (every time you apply a new layer) and again after the top coat.
  It took me applying 4 layers of the color to have it look acceptable. Imagine crushing up a bunch of gray chalk (I bought the color city scape) and mixing it with water.. It didn't go on evenly and it was not thick enough at all!! Every time I would cure (even after adding extra time) and wipe my nails, a lot of the color would rub right off.
  I will just spend a few extra bucks on opi.",0
I didn't like this cream. I find no benefits; it doesn't help me to manage my thin hair and it has zero holding power!! It is just like putting nothing on your hair !,0
Best product ever - easy to use and takes away appearance of bald spots,1
"Although the bottle appears to be different from the picture, but product is freshly made in 2013 and I am happy!",1
"I got almost 4 months of use out of this bottle (2x a day), but unfortunately saw no results. NO changes in the age spots or the hyperpigmentation. No evening out the color but I guess possibly a tiny improvement in brightness.  It does smell nice, is light and non greasy, and it did not break me out (which is always number one on my list of requirements).  It just did nothing else for my 40's uneven skin tone.",0
This product is not TANGLE FREE I would not recommend for young girls or long hair. Otherwise i love it,1
"A worthy substitute for TIGI Catwalk's Haute Iron Spray, which I usually use but ran out of and couldn't find anywhere. Costs about as much as the Haute Iron Spray, too. The can says it provides a ""hold""-- don't worry, it is NOT a hairspray.",1
Seems to work for me!  Thanks!,1
"Not something I would buy again. I have very thin hair that is also thinning, it was very obvious that something was sprinkled on my scalp. It looked like I dipped my head in cinnamon. I am sure this works well for others, but for me this is another strike out in the pursuit of fuller looking hair. Happy I only purchased the sample size.",0
"I was really looking forward to this box.  I don't normally get luxury beauty supplies, so this was a treat.

I was a little disappointed when it arrived and one of the items had leaked all over the inside of the box.

I really do enjoy getting sample size things for trying out, especially of higher end products.  While I may want to try something, and if it works like I want or need it to, I will definitely pay for a full size...  I don't want to start by paying for a full size when I don't know much about it with regards to my skin.

Case in point, the sunblock in this box.  This is NOT a knock against the sunblock.  I am highly allergic to the ingredients in a LOT of sunblocks (apparently it's more than one or a specific combination, I've refused testing for all of them because a) OW and b) I can't afford that number of tests.  Instead, I am super careful about what sunblocks I use.)

I really had hoped that this sunblock would work on me, since it is a nice, high SPF.  Nope.  In less than 2 minutes, my skin was burning and turning red, and before I could get it off, I was already showing signs of allergic reaction.  WAY cheaper to try out a sample size in a box like this, than to have spent money on a full size bottle.

I liked the toothpaste sample, although I won't change from my normal toothpaste for it.  It wasn't that nifty.  The nail polish is way too light for my normal tastes, however, I like the formula of it and will happily use it in some of my nail art.  (It's a bit thin, so definitely has to have at least 2 coats, but if I am doing something that just needs a layer of polish under it, this will work just fine.)

I haven't tried the eyeshadow, but that one was amazingly beautiful.  And full sized!  That was a surprise, and a very pleasant one.

The bath ""oil"" (bath gel) was what leaked, and that was frustrating.  The smell is nice enough, but I won't switch for it.  The perfume will go to a friend, since I don't wear perfumes, and I haven't tried most of the rest yet.  But so far, for the price, it was a fantastic deal.  I'm super happy with the purchase, and will definitely do another if I can catch one in time.",1
The handle on this curling iron is ridiculous! I just wanted a normal curling iron that had great heat. This handle's cumbersomeness should be printed in BOLD in the description.,0
i loved the shampoo so i decided to try this. Found other lotions better for half the price.,0
"Great adjustable razor for wet shaving. I use it daily with no issues. The only things I would consider is there is no texture on the handle and the shaving head is larger than average. If this is a concern to you I would look at other razors. People have stated concern over how you change the blade being dangerous (you must pull off the blade cover), but as long as the razor is dry and you pay attention you should be fine.",1
"I love most of the Mario Badescu line, however, after applying a small amount in the morning, it still isn't absorbed by the evening. Perhaps I will try it as an overnight eye cream. Read a real simple review it is the best eye cream available, but it didn't work for my skin.",0
"I have tried numerous store brands of shaving cream/gel over the years, and I was bored with them.  I suppose they worked, but I knew there had to be something better.  After a bit of searching around I came across this product. Despite balking a bit at the price, gave it a go.  Man is this stuff awesome.  A fingertip worth does the job for me.  Great lather, smells fantastic, and makes for a great smooth shave.  Ahh.  One jar lasted me a long time (I just reordered).  Note that their aftershave balm is incredible as well (I like it even more than the cream).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Art-of-Shaving-After-Shave-Balm-Sandalwood-Essential-Oil-for-All-Skin-Types-Packaging-May-Vary-3-4-fl-oz-125-ml/dp/B000FGVJWW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Art of Shaving After-Shave Balm, Sandalwood Essential Oil, for All Skin Types, Packaging May Vary, 3.4 fl oz (125 ml)</a>&nbsp;Very happy I found these products.",1
Nope. Drybar all the way,0
"This product does wanders to my hair! I have naturally course and frizzy hair, so finding hair styling tools that work for me are difficult. I used to have the NuMe  3 in 1 curling wand and I loved it too, but this is so much faster and gives the waves a more defining look. When you first curl your hair it looks almost too curly, but once you brush through them it turns into beautiful waves. Even though this product is a little pricey, it is worth it.",1
"Dries out hair, does not atomize, most pour out of bottle to use.",0
Love the Image products!,1
"Extremely disappointed in this product and this is the third one I have purchased.  The first came from QVC three or four years ago and it worked great.  Best styling tool I've ever owned.  It started not heating so well at the beginning of last year so I purchased a new one.  It worked great for several months then stopped heating also.  Purchased this one, tried it once and it barely heats at all so I returned it.  I think they started making their products more cheaply.  This tool is no better than the $15 ones at Walmart or Ulta.",0
So far so good. Just got it today and registered it with no problems.,1
it works!,1
My 17 year old son loves this. He wanted to try it after finsing a sample in a catalog so we got it for his biethday. It was perfect.,1
"I really like to this product, I saw results within the first week of using it",1
Great in every way (except price).,1
"Color is not great.  Light is looks purple, two or three coats it looks dark taupe.  And the glitter gives the polish and chunky finishes.  Also, it peels off in two days.  Other vinylux last 7 days.  Ps don't use this seller. They wrap in a brown paper bag. And it breaks, post office won't let u put it back in mail damage, but seller won't accept return",0
Took this on my recent trip to a tropical island. It worked great and blended well into the skin unlike the same brand tinted SPF cream (don't waste your money on that stuff). My husband used it too and he liked it. No breakouts from sunscreen and we also did not burn.,1
Darker than expected,1
"This is definitely a good purchase for the price! Very high quality. The iron part is in gold color, not silver as in the picture. Love it!",1
"Like the creamy texture.  This stuff cleans very well without drying effect. Doesn't have any scent from what I can tell. I was diagnosed with rosacea. Started rinsing my face with only water in the morning and in the evening wash my face with this stuff to get my make-up off. Anyway, I have been using this product for about the last two years but have been using it exclusively for the 8 months or so and my face is so much calmer.  BTW Estee Lauder Doublewear powder or foundation works well for my sensitive skin.",1
It does the trick.,1
"I found that this mascara broke off my eyelashes. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. I am not sure I want to hassle with the return although I am afraid to use it again. I also thought I closed and tightened the wand, but it leaked all lover my cosmetic bag. I 've never had a mascara do that before.",0
"This is an amazing product.  Although it is a repair creme for aging, I use it on acne.  It regenerates your skin over night.  It deals with a wide array of skin issues - acne, redness from previous acne, damaged skin, scars, etc.  I highly recommend it.  The price on amazon is outstanding.  This often runs for 70 dollars in a dermatologist's office.",1
I thought the CC cream was too heavy for me and it set on top of my skin and made my pores more noticeable. I did reorder the BB cream and like it a lot better....,0
"Wow...works greats! Anytime my head starts to feel 'itchy' , just one shampoo with this and it stops any dandruff in its tracks! And for such strong medicinal shampoo, it doesn't leave the length of my hair stinky for days, like other dandruff shampoos! I have waist length hair and I hate stinky hair so it's really nice to have an anti dandruff shampoo that works great and doesn't make your hair smell horrible.",1
This product is great and I have been using it for years.  Very happy with the look by using this product.,1
"I have medium-length baby fine hair, and was hoping for some volume, but this does nothing for my hair.",0
Skin doesn't really change. It does take off make-up.,0
"I would have given this product 5 stars but the pump on mine didn't work (maybe something happened during shipping). I also don't like the packaging as you can't know for sure how low you are running until it might be too late. As for the product itself; it is great! You won't be disappointed. It doesn't have any chemical smells, goes on smoothly and feels silky. I have very oily skin and when using this product don't feel like I am ""adding"" anything extra that will clog my pores. I do thing my skin looks shinier but I just dab some translucent powder and problem solved.",1
Product was exactly what I ordered and all my expectations was met. Very pleased,1
Don't know if it works yet because I just recently started using it.,1
excellent soap,1
I don't feel this did much for my lips but the person that recommended it to me said it was their fav so might work better for others,0
My husband told me it looked as if if was meant for kids lol. I agreed It did have a little to many sparkles for an adult. It may look better with acrylic applied to the nail as the others colors do. A little disappointed....,0
"really great formula, very opaque and smooth white polish! i quite like it. two downsides: without an extremely shiny top coat, it dries looking a bit like white-out, and the brush of zoya polish is really thin and small.",1
"Amazing hair mask. Leaves hair extremely soft, damage free.",1
"Love this product
Cleans without drying skin .
Only a tinny amount in the palm of your hand is enough  To was your face .
Vary cost efficient .",1
"Can not try this because I can not get any cream to dispense.  No directions except for a stick on label that says ""Press here""
which I repeatedly did.  Nothing!  No luck getting the lid off either.",0
"the product itself is good and refreshes the skin after washing your face, but it kinda feels sticky afterwards",1
"I have used this for 2 months now. I apply it as close to my lash line as possible ( only upper) after I have washed my face every night. I have noticed longer eyelashes, but the con far outweigh the growth as it has caused discoloration on my eyelids -which unfortunately is more pronounced at the bottom. I have to apply eyeliner just to balance the effects of this. I don't know if this happened to other people or maybe my skin is just sensitive but having loner lashes is not worth it, if you have discoloration on your eyelids.",0
This face wash made my face SO dry and itchy and smelt unpleasant. I really am looking for a great combo skin face cleanser and cream and both these products have been a disappointment.,0
"Really smells like banana.

Ingredients are:

Water, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (shea butter), Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Cocos Nucifera (coconut) oil, Butylene Glycol, Macadamia Integrifolia seed oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Musa Sapientum (Banana) fruit extract, Milk Protein extract, Urea, Pentylene Glycol, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Caprylyl Glycol, Tromethamine, Ethylhexylglycerin, 1, 2-Hexanediol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance, Cl 19140, Cl 15985",1
I received a sample of this in my Ipsy bag last month and loved it! The smell and feel of the product was wonderful in the sample. I ordered this on Amazon and not sure if it is old or not a genuine product - it doesn't smell or feel anything like the sample I received. Disappointed. Want to return.,0
"This is not an authentic Davines product. Packaging is exact but if you have ever had the real deal Davines Nounou you will know the difference after use. This product is lighter in color, not as thick and smells real at first sniff (real Nounou has a very strong perfume musk fragrance) but then smells like harsh chemicals after you massage it in and rinse. After first use I noticed from the chemical smell it wasn't real Davines product. Unfortunately I had to use it for a few days until my order came from the Davines website. After a week of use I noticed when brushing my hair out after use, there was a lot more hair in the brush. It caused a noticeable amount if gair loss for me. I had a real Davines container so I compared the ingredients. Identical except for ""Creatine"" is an ingredient in the fake...which can cause hair loss. Don't be fooled by the decent price and fast shipping...spend the extra 6 dollars and get the real product.",0
This color is so beautiful and perfect. Remind me of a vintage blue once you paint it on your nails. I loved how it was shipped fast and bubble wrapped. Will definitely order from them again!,1
Super quick delivery.  Item just as promised!,1
Works Good. Smells Great! I only wished the made a matching conditioner.,1
"I was disappointed to find that there were only 6 eye masks per box. This was NOT clearly described in the description of the Elemis eye masks, it merely says .1lbs which gives no indication of how many come in a box (and nowhere on the box have I found a weight so who's to say if the product is actually .1lbs). For $85 I feel ripped off.",0
"I have been using this product for several years. I learned of it from a nurse who did skin work. I need it in our dry climate, I also use it as sunscreen on my arms during the summer. Great stuff.",1
Used my mini NuFACE faithfully for 3 mo. now.  I read where Dr. Oz said worth a try. I'm 73 with good genes.  I really haven't seen a big enough of a change to call it a change.  But I'm glad I tried it.  I wouldn't have been happy till I did. Women of our age probably need to accept & embrace ourselves.  I wouldn't tell anyone not to try it who want to.  You can feel what it's doing & I'm sure some people respond differently than others.,0
I have very colored hari...It helps color hold for the long run.....I use the whole ssystem,1
Good product.,1
bueno,1
Bad color for for redheads. Way too pink.  I was looking for something more skin tone.  Gave it to my sister in law and hope she can use it.,0
"Great soap - pretty useless presentation of quality product to guests when the dispenser doesn't work!

Soap does a great job of not drying out hands.",1
Perfect color!,1
Too gunky and flakes a lot,0
"It doesn't go on smooth, nor look ""natural"" at all.",0
"I purchased the pink taupe, the color is great and it goes on nice. The downside is that this lipstick does NOT stay on very long. I've been a dedicated purchaser of Covergirl Outlast Lipstick for many years, but wanted to try something new. This just doesn't compare to the staying power of my drugstore brand.",0
"This lipstick is a pretty shade. It's a sort of neutral red, possibly leaning towards cool tones. It looks really nice on my skin, which has definite pink undertones.  For me, it's on the very edge of what's acceptable wear for work- probably the darkest color I could get away with in a professional environment.  Lasting power is pretty good.  It held for 3-4 hours, which is not bad, especially as I usually have something to drink in that time.  This lipstick is described as moisturizing, and I think that's taking things a bit far.  It wasn't especially drying, but it did not feel moisturizing at all.  So, not my favorite lipstick, but pretty, and I enjoy wearing it.",1
"This should be a staple for anyone who wants to look the same in the evening as they did when you left in the morning,",1
"I love this because it smells like tobacco and whiskey, which masks how drunk on whiskey I am and how many cigarettes I've smoked today.

Great product!",1
Bought  to draw my eyeliner like on the comercial but nothing!!,0
Claims to be matte finish not very matte especially for fine hair. To heavy and not enough hold.,0
Huele delicioso,1
"Got a sample of this at Sephora.  Dawn dishwashing liquid removes oil from skin as well as dishes, so my hands had become very dry and rough. The tips of my fingers were the worse. I could tell a big difference after only one treatment. A little goes a long way. Will buy more when sample runs out. I don't notice any strong smell.",1
Cover girl color correcting concealer is better and much cheaper.,0
Been using this for years. Only thing ill ever use,1
Too pricey. No results really.,0
This Hair product was not what I thought it would be.  Just my opinion. It may work for others.,0
"I was so disappointed with this product. The color was not pretty at all, and I did not like the consistency of the product...I felt like I had a thick ugly pink antacid on my lips...my husband took one look and said ""Yuck""!.'.Fortunately with the wonderful Amazon customer friendly Prime membership, I just send it back and get a full refund. 1 star for the Stila lipstick but 5 stars for Amazon!",0
I was very disappointed in this. For some reason this color chips the same day you put it on. I even tried using a top coat. Color I like but chippinng I don't . Won't buy this one ever again,0
"I followed all directions closely and then read all the reviews for more solutions.  I found there is no technical support.  Unfortunately I looked at the overall rating before buying instead of reading enough rating to see how many fail.  Returning item.  Hard to imagine why a company would ship a $119 item and not test it before shipping it, especially since so many people have had the same problem I did, just turning it on.  Poor quality control.",0
This is refreshing and a nice smell. I opted out of Madonna's brand for this cheaper version. Im not sure if I'll like hers better but this works great for my wallet capacity!,1
Awful color!!,0
"I got the 8.5oz. Yes its a bit pricy, but it is the most cost-efficient presentation. And when you consider most face moisturizers tend to cost around usd$10-15 for 50ml, this 250ml presentation, is pretty much in line...

...now on to the product itself. I admit, I had never tried (or even heard of) Jack Black (besides the actor/singer), and was worried I had ordered so much product of something I might not like!

Fortunately, I was delighted. First of, its a very light lotion. It absorbs very quickly on to the skin. It leaves no residue. Nor does it leave you feeling/looking mucky and greasy. It really amazing how...velvety it is. I have slightly oily skin that breaks out occasionally. This lotion has caused me no problems.

As for the smell, well its kinda like baby talc, as someone mentioned I think. Its kinda weird at the beginning, but you get used to it. And it becomes kinda agreable. Plus my girlfriend loves the smell.

I highly recommend this moisturizer.",1
My favorite !!,1
So who knows what is in this. But. Some derm recommended it. And he doesn't sell it and doesn't own the company. So I decided to try it. It's probably not science but I do like the cream. My skin is good but I got the genes and it's enhanced. :) anyways. If you're a junkie you'll try any cream even one where they refuse to list ingredients. Ok I admit it. I have a problem .......,1
I couldn't stand the smell. I've never used this product before but from what I read it should have been more yellowy.,0
I hate this because it doesn't wash out and leaves a gross layer on my hair. I used it before getting a hair cut and the stylist thought something was medically wrong with my hair. Once she washed it out all was well. :),0
The product was different color and smell. Im not sure if this is real matrix biolage shampoo. Ive been ordering for over a year now and first time Im disappointed.,0
I don't know if this works. I think This is a good start to see which of the items you want after you run out. If you do the whole thing every day you will run out before too long BUT- I like th tingly feel of the daytime cream. I like the soft scent of the nighttime cream. When I ran out of the daytime I just used regular lotion  didn't have caffiene  but I  like to think this works. The motion of rough massage seems to be real likely more benefitial than than just magic cream. I think I will re buy the day cream.,1
I bought this as a gift for a friend. The perfume arrived intime. After opening the package I noticed that the plastic wrap around the perfume box was cut open at the bottom. I became suspecious and opened the box. I noticed that the bottle had finger prints all over and was looking dirty. The perfume smelled diluted. I won't buy from the seller perfume depot again,0
"My Mom and I have both used this. We agree that it's a great moisturizer, that it rubs in smoothly, and that it does not leave a greasy feel on your skin. Our only point of disagreement is with the scent. Mom loves it and describes as mild and pleasant. I, on the other hand, find it pleasant, but just a bit too heavy. With the name ""sweet orange and cedar wood,"" I expected something a bit more citrusy, but this leans more to the cedar wood side.",1
After 1.5 years the hinge on the top plastic broke. It should last longer than that.,0
I've used Calvin Klein Eternity for several years now and I love it.  It's not overpowering as long as you don't go overboard with it. Two or three sprays is enough to last most of my work day.  It's a fresh summer scent.  I have since found another cologne that is my number one but Calvin Klein Eternity is my go-to second!,1
100% original. and I receive compliments all the time wearing this fragance. Its divine,1
"It got my face dry to the point that it started to drastically peel all over.  It also gave my skin a leather like texture.  I did help my face clear up faster.  At the end, face peeling all over with a leather like texture is not for me.",0
i had the full size mary lou and this one seems to be a slightly different color which i liked the original full size color much bette. The betty and cindy are nice on my carmel skin.,1
"I don't actually hate this, but recently, upon research (A FEW MONTHS AFTER I BOUGHT IT), i found this product to be quite toxic to the skin w/ the ingredients contained.
Search it yourself with the EWG website: [...]  I like it and was going to buy another, but not after researching the chemicals contained in this.",0
"The product arrived on time, however, it had clearly previously been used. Because this is a product which goes on my eye lids, I cannot use it because it has been previously use and I do not want to get an infection. The reason I believe this product was previously used are for the following reasons: the box it arrived in was opened and beaten up, and the eye shadow palette did not have the plastic cover across the eye shadow that always goes over the shadow in a new eye shadow palette. The eyeshadow had come out of its pots and was all over the eye shadow palette. This product did not meet my expectations.",0
I have VERY oily skin.  These are great!  I can only use every 3 days or my skin becomes to dry.,1
"Does not go on smoothly and evenly.  Even with the Vinylux Top coat, it chipped the next day and looked terrible.",0
Great Shampoo!,1
This product is completed overrated and seems like hair spray more than a beach wave spray so it left my hair  very sticky.,0
"I ordered a bottle of this back in November, I was not sure if I was going to like it or not.  Well I did.  I use it nightly and I still have some left, but I am ordering another bottle now so I do not run out.  Really helps with wrinkles.  Will definitely continue to use it.",1
"I have tried lots of shave creams and really like the creams in a tube. Jack Black has no lubrication and does not lather all that well.  There are a lot of better creams for less money and excellent creams for the same. Jack Black does moisturize but it isn't good for shaving. If you have a beard and do a lot of outlining this might be for you, it is clear and gives a good enough shave for this to be a benefit.  Tabac brand with a spice scent and Godrej with more of a soap scent so far are the best creams in a tube I have tried, both have great lather and great lubrication.  Cella with a almond cherry scent and Castle Forbes various scents are fantastic creams in a jar once again both have great lather and lubrication.

Don't waste your money on Jack Black.",0
"Personally I love the product, sadly my daughter is allergic to it.  She breaks out in tiny blisters all over her head.",1
"The first thing you will notice about this bar is the smell. It is smells wonderful. A nice, light clean smell that even double as an air freshener for the bathroom. When we first got it, my husband was worried that the smell would also mean that the bar would be harsh on his skin. Not so. Even with his sensitive skin, he loves it. Suds up nicely and leaves his skin feeling fresh and smooth.",1
I love it!,1
"This La Roche-Posay Toleriane Teint in ""Golden Beige"" is darker in tint than I expected.  It dispenses and applies easily, but there's a strong alcohol smell and it feels tight and drying if you have dry skin.  It's definitely not hydrating as advertised and like other reviewers have mentioned, it feels chalky.  The primary ingredient, after water, is silcone (dimethicone), which I don't think is ideal since it can feel heavy.  Also, there's no SPF.

I found the coverage kinda of grainy, too.  I like that this is made in France, but I don't see any other reason to get this when there are other mid-market and drugstore options that are better.",0
"I am pleased to say that the product is not causing any skin irritation or discomfort but at the same time it is not really producing any noticeable results. One tiny vial container contains enough activator fluid for mere one application with the included pure marine algae Eye Masks. These eye masks are very fragile and tends to tear and break apart when you pour in the activator fluid. In the end the areas around the eyes does feel hydrated but nothing spectacular improvement that was noticeable with the suggested 10 mins.

Having said, The main reason for using the included pure marine algae Eye Masks is to apply the applicator fluid without using cotton based puffs which may contain pesticides that causes skin irritation but this also causes a lot of wastage of the applicator fluid since it drips and causing a messy waste since you are doing it at home alone and not in a professional SPA where someone else applies this for you while you lie down and sleep.

What I have discovered is that the applicator fluid is good for the skin around your eyes. It does make skin softer and feels well moisturized. Does this remove the black circle marks around the eyes - Maybe but that means you need to keep spending a lot of money and wasting a lot of these applicator fluid & pure marine algae Eye Masks each time you use them.

Instead I suggest that to make most use of this package and the six tiny vial containers by applying the applicator fluid directly around the skin of your eyes by your index finger just enough to moisten before you go to sleep every night and you will find positive improvement around your eyes. Not only because you are not wasting the applicator fluid but also long time application for 2-3 weeks every night does make the skin clear, tight and rejuvenated.

For the price & wastage of applicator fluid and messy difficult to use algae Eye Masks I am forced to rate this with two stars. Otherwise the product does not cause any harm to you other than raising eyebrows looking at the price-tag :)",0
"My hair feels alive again ,shiny and smelling wonderful .
Best shampoo out there .i use it with the hair mask and leave in .
My damaged hair is finally growing ,shiny and looking very healthy",1
"I have had this item for 4 months and it has sparked multiple times from the flat plates and the outlet. I have other hair dryers and curling irons, none of which have ever sparked or caused similar issues. I am concerned regarding the safety of this item and that this may particular item may be defective. The times I had used it prior, I was pleased with the result, though the safety surrounding this item is very concerning.",0
Really good light peel .. skin looks brighter,1
"Good product at a fair price!  My son recommended this product to me.  I was amazed at what a closer shave I was able to achieve with this product compared to other consumer shaving creams that you can purchase at your local Target or Walmart stores.  Highly recommend.  Once you try, you won't go back to the old shaving cream/gel bottles!!!",1
"From the description, I thought I'd like this, but I don't.  I've been using American Crew body wash for years and haven't found one I like more.  I thought I'd try this because of favorable reviews.  Smells too ""woody"" to me instead of refreshing.  Of course fragrance is subjective.",0
"I gave it a 4 star because it seems to have a slightly different formula compared to prior, meaning, it seems a little more sticky.",1
Amazing formula and colour. However it breaks really easily. I travel alot and take it with me and the product cracked after a couple of months :(,1
It isn't the proverbial fountain of youth but had I known about this 20 years ago and started using it...  I can only imagine how much it would have impacted my aging process.  Good stuff...,1
I really like this product but the cost is really high.,1
"This product is expensive, but it works. The plumping effect only lasts while you're wearing it or the day after so I use it when I know I'll be on camera. Too pricey for me to use on a daily basis but if I had the expendable income, I would.",1
A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.  DO NOT BUY!  IT MADE MY HAIR FALL OUT EVEN MORE...I used for a year!  Sadly this company is taking advantage of people that desperately want their hair back.  I've tried everything and the only thing that helped stop my hair from thinning some more; is hair vitamins and healthy eating and a natural vitamin herb called foti.,0
I have very little hair but this moisturizers scalp well.,1
"A lot of moisturizers break me out, but this hasn't so far. It doesn't have a strong sunscreen-ish smell, either.",1
These are FAKE.  Not the real Grandelash.,0
Great product. It is buildable so you can get as much coverage as you want. I like a lighter coverage. This works great. Looks very natural.,1
"Best brush soap on the market, and a great price!",1
"I have tried several different brands, and this is by far the best!!! Smells lemony, works well at getting oil from hair for less shampooing",1
"So far, of all the tanning solutions, sprays, creams, etc....that I have tried I find this one works the best.  I get a nice, even realistic-looking tan and the only orangish areas are on the bony parts of my body (ankle bones, tops of my feet) where I neglected to wipe the tanning mousse off. So, overall it tans well and lasts me about a week before I notice it fading away.  I can even shave my legs and still keep my tan.

Other reviewers have very well described in detail the application process (which should be followed exactly for a positive result), so I won't waste mine or your time talking about it.  Though the XEN-TAN Mousse is a bit pricey I think it delivers a good tan for the money.  I've tried a lot of other tanning products and some worked well but others turned me orange or didn't last past the next shower.  This one seems to hold for a while which is good.",1
"I received this in my Ipsy Glam Bag subscription and was really excited to use it, but it is the absolute worst eyeliner I have ever used. 30 mins after application, I had eyeliner down half of my face!  I tried it a second time, only lining the top lids, same thing. It managed to bleed under my eyes. I tried it a third time blending it for a smoky effect and yes, it did it again. It's embarrassing to be out in public with eyeliner all over the place. I looked like I had been crying and didn't wipe off my running eyeliner. My skin is dry, not oily, and I primed my eyes and used dry shadow before application.

I feel guilty throwing this product away, but would feel even more guilty giving it to my worst enemy.",0
Do not buy.  I thought this would  a great alternaive to Sephora brush cleaner.  NOT.  Verydisapointing,0
"This stuff smells so good,  fresh and clean.  It doesn't smell as much like mint as I expected.  More of a lemongrass I think.
I have dry hair and usually need a thick conditioner so this one was thinner usual for me but it worked really well and my hair smelled fresh all day.",1
"I first used this in a W hotel where Bliss products were provided. It worked perfectly on my face and there was enough in the mini bottle to last a few weeks after I got home. Unfortunately, after using this new large bottle my face has broken out. It is not the same consistency as the mini bottle...seems a lot more watery and the micro scrubber beads aren't even noticeable. Very disappointed. I won't use this again.",0
"This works nicely, have to apply it a little bit more than expected. Overall a good product.",1
"need to reapply constantly, and if you try to rub it in it just smears it. Not worth my money",0
"I heard this was an amzing product, but it's certainly not for everyone.  This made my hair gummy, greasy looking and flat as a pancake.",0
Very light,0
Fits my blow dyer but when you take it off it scratches it.,1
Love it,1
"I absolutely love and trust La Roche Posay. This product is great for oily skin because of its dry touch, although also because of it, I fell I have to use more product to cover my face.",1
Great cleanser for sensitive skin.  Leaves skin feeling moisturized instead of dry after most cleansers.,1
helps my hair great awesome product,1
"Its like a spray on hair wax, makes my already thick and wavy hair slightly more piecey and moldable. Adds a lot of volume as well, which is good for finer hair but maybe not the desired beachy look for thicker hair like mine.",1
"I'm not too sure about this one. I had bought the Colorproof in the purple bottle which I think is the moisturizing formula. I went ahead and bought this one because the price was so good for the size but I'm wondering if this is even the real deal. When I used to buy Pureology I would vary between their products just for a change but each product made my hair feel and act wonderful. I figured it would be the same with Colorproof but this shampoo and/or maybe the conditioner make my hair kind of frizzy which is weird considering I have very straight hair. It's also hard to comb through after I get out of the shower. It doesn't style well with my round brush or flat iron. It's a real large bottle so I have to find someone who will appreciate it.

Update: I purchased this from Larkin Products. Sometimes these reviews will show up just for the product and not the actual seller you purchased it from. They just sent me a very aggressive email that I need to send them an email before I leave comments. I didn't realize you have to have permission to leave comments on Amazon. I did return the product through Amazon and Amazon did give me a refund. I'm now going to double check seller ratings before I buy anything on Amazon.",0
"Recieved it with the top busted, have to pour it out everytime i want to use it now.",0
"It smells so so bad. I dread putting it on everyday because of the smell, but I love the effect of it. The serum minus the smell gave me great results.",1
"Does not go on smoothly and evenly.  Even with the Vinylux Top coat, it chipped the next day and looked terrible.",0
This has worked magic on my stretch marks during my pregnancy I will continue to use it and hope all my stretch marks go away! Love it!!,1
The smell is overbearing and awful especially when combined with a hot shower. the actual cleansing seems to work alright,0
Loved how easy and fast drying it was.,1
"Product received promptly in a well cushioned envelope.  However quality of nail polish leads me to believe it is either extremely old or had been sitting for a long period of time in extreme temperatures.  Nail polish is extremely watery, not at all glossy even after 3 coats. It is not the quality I am used to when compared to other Essie nail polishes",0
Disappointed with what received. The small bottle contains hairspray not the fiber product. Waste of money.,0
Excellent quality- great price for this large container.,1
"I desperately wanted to purchase this hair masque after reading the article in Vogue 2008.  But when I cross-referenced the writer's rave reviews with the real life reviews on Amazon.com and Makeup Alley, I chalked it up to another useless product I didn't need.

Fast forward two years.  I'm older, I have a newborn baby - my hair is a dry, frizzy mess.  I don't know if it is the hormones, age, lack of sleep, but my hair is so much dryer, and the texture has changed.  It's like the Vogue writer said, it's old lady hair, not young girl hair.  In the past, I would have doused it with deep conditioner and sat for 2 hours under my bonnet dryer (yes I have one of those).  But time is no longer  a luxury that I have and I'm not likely to see it again for the next ten years.  I need a solution that really works and doesn't take forever.

The Philip B. Katira hair masque is it.

I think the term hair masque is a little confusing.  Hair masque conjures up images of intensive, creamy conditioner.  That is not what this product is.  It is a lightweight gel that fills in the porous cracks of damaged and dry hair, fortifying it, sealing it, softening it and making it oh so much better.  My hair is curly and after using the masque, I get well-defined, spiral curls all the way down my back.  And what's amazing is that the curls are really soft yet still well-defined.  In fact they are so soft and voluminous I put in either Ouidad hair spray or gel to stiffen it up.  It really does look like it did back in college when I could put $5 L'Oreal mousse in my hair, run out the door and have a fabulous hair day.  Ah youth!  Now it takes expensive haircuts and products to get it to look as good.

The Katira hair masque works best in conjunction with your favorite conditioners that you already have in your arsenal and makes them work better.  After I shower, I squeeze a good amount (I have a lot of long, curly hair) of the Philip B. hair masque into my hand and comb it through my hair with my fingers, followed with a wide tooth comb.  I have been experimenting with different kinds of comb-thru, leave-in conditioners all to great success including:  Weleda Rosemary hair oil (fabulous on my dry ends and a little goes such a long way), Devacurl One Condition,  Ouidad Summer Spray.  I don't use all of these leave-in's together - that would be too much!  But I choose one of these conditioners to use with the hair masque, depending on what my hair needs that day.  I do not wash any of this out.  To ""stiffen"" my curls, I have been spraying with Ouidad hair spray or using Kiehl's Silk Groom (I have had this bottle forever and never really used it, but it works really well in conjunction with the masque and maintains the volume in a nicely controlled way.)

I bought other hair products before I purchased this one in my quest to soften my hair's dry texture:  Josie Maran Argan hair oil (I wanted to buy Moroccan hair oil treatment after I read Cindy Crawford's endorsement of it - she said it was good at softening the texture of older hair.  But they didn't have it at Sephora and Josie Maran is pretty much the same thing.  Alas, it is not as good as Philip B's solution.)  I also purchased Rene Furterer's deep conditioning masque.  Again good, but once it washed out, it never changed the inherent dry and wiry texture of my ""old lady"" hair.

I also purchased the Philip B. Amber Shampoo (what a divine, yummy smell) and was given the Philip B. Peppermint and Avocado Shampoo for free after a shipping mix up.  Since the hair masque came first, I have used it alone as well as with the shampoos.  Unlike other hair products that need to be used with each other in order to work well, you really can use the hair masque alone to great success.  I shampooed my hair today with the Amber Shampoo and then used the Katira Masque, but there really wasn't a difference in terms of it working better with the shampoo.

I will never be without the Philip B. masque again.  It really does work.  I hope this helps!",1
Masks were expired and covered in nasty little brown spots.,0
very good,1
No change for me.  Have used this product off and on several times for many months.  Does not live up to claims.  Waste of money...try something else for better results.,0
"People raved and ranted about how this product was some type of magical miracle duck tape for nose pores that would immediately unclog all your pores. LIES!! I decided to buy this because being someone who works around horses a lot, my pores tend to be clogged more than I'd like to admit. I tried this out so excited and with high expectations. I took a nice hot shower, exfoliated my skin, then applied this mask and waited for it to dry completely. At minimal it took out small amount of debris from my pores but nothing enough to justify the price tag. So I decided to use this product every night for 4 days straight. I was hoping that maybe it would get better with each use. NOPE! at best it rips out the micro hairs we all have on our faces and thats about it. I've had better luck with Biore nose strips from walmart! This stuff is NOT worth the price and I'm more tempted to stick actual duck tape to my face than buy this product again",0
I love my clarisonic Mia and use it twice a day but these news brushes do not fit.  I thought I ordered for the Mia but they do not fit.,0
"Nice light smell, easily absorbed, no oily hands afterwards.",1
Love this product,1
"Nice polish, but very much like others made by this company in micro sparkle color coats, a clear polish that goes over other polishes for a kick.",1
Ive tried literally every OTC option for my adult acne. Used this faithfully for 3 months and my skin is worse than ever. Chalk this up to another disappointment!,0
This stuff works and smells great. I have the entire line of this brand and I'm in love!,1
Strong smell it first fades away quickly with a medium amount of time but the smell itself is a good men's smell next one I buy is the lighter one the other one that Jack Black cat is in yellow good product,1
"I received the package and it just looked a little off. It was sealed in plastic, but it was very simple. I opened the box and the actual name Kenneth Cole on the bottle was written different than on my old bottle. I'm guessing it's a copy of his signature so that seemed off.  After all this I sprayed it hoping it was ok...it was definitely not Kenneth Cole Black.  It didn't smell bad and if I had never worn it before I would have probably been fooled.  I called amazon and they refunded me immediately and told me to do whatever I wanted with the bottle so now when my 3 year old wants to smell good like daddy I use it for him.",0
my tooth color is still the same as it was before I started using the product.  I used it for about month and a half.,0
This dries my hair really well but it blows VERY HARD! I have really thick hair and on the high setting my hair gets tangled pretty easily (never had that problem before). I have tons of body in my hair compared to my old dryer and I love that! Haven't noticed that it is any faster at drying though.,1
Always a favorite!,1
Washes off with water. Not foldable when you want a more dramatic look.,0
This product worked wonders for my natural nails!!  I stop getting gel over lays and the gel and drilling on my nails every two weeks caused my nails to get very thin and brittle!!  This nail strengthener worked wonders!!  My nails grew out completely and got very strong in a months time!!  I'm very happy with the results!!,1
Good color that matches the advertisement- stays hydrated 6 -8 hours with ease,1
"Simply incredible this cream. We purchased a ton of this company's products after discovering them while in a shopping mall in our recent Panama vacation. Don't know how I ever managed without... This and the rose scented balm we use on our lips. It seems to last forever and keeps lips moist even in dry AC rooms. Try also the deo stick. It is the best we ever used and keeps pits dry and odourless for entire day, while all natural and healthy!",1
"I'm a huge fan of hot rollers. I purchased this set because of the portability - my sets at home are too clunky to bring while travelling.

My issues with this set:
1) If the rollers are not inserted PERFECTLY (and you might think they are!), they will not heat up. Yes, they have markers on them to indicate if they are heated but if you're not watching them, you may easily not notice until you go to use them.

2) These don't get overly warm to begin with even after letting them sit for 25 minutes.

3) Rollers are heavy, resulting in them pulling down on your hair and slipping out of the clips (some people point out that many sets don't come with clips so this is a courtesy but for $120, it's not a courtesy, it's part of the item I'm paying for and they aren't working as they should)
Positives of this set:

1) Portability. That's about it.
I tried these many times with different products (hairsprays, mousse, au naturel), with freshly washed and second day hair... I just was not impressed. I'll stick with my $40 sets (of different sizes) and bring a curling iron for travel purposes.
I returned this item.",0
Great in summer after a camping vacation.  It helps to put everything back in place.,1
Awkward to use. Too bad cause it's cute,0
Love the product,1
This did not work. It did not look like the videos and it was dropping out of my husband's head as black dust on his white shirt. Thankfully if didn't stain. It also came off on the couch. Very disappointed.,0
"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1
"Ok, so it makes great lather.  But it's more than a real handful.  It must weigh close to a pound. Which makes it ungainly. Naturally, it's slippery, but you'll find yourself dropping it constantly in the shower or hunting for it in the tub.  You simply can't get get a good grip on it. So buy the smaller bar.  You'll be grateful.",0
makes a good lather and works better than canned soap any day!,1
"I haven't been using it long enough to judge it's lightening, however I love the liquid base it comes in. Most skin lighteners are drying and stink of alcohol. Not this one. Pleasant smell and very moisturizing.",1
Produce works great but it seems like it has shoddy container - sometimes a problem to the product out and the label wasn't secure - but I would buy it again because the product indeed is working for me.,1
I never ordered this,0
Packs a ton of heat for a little guy! Had this on next to my mini chi and I could feel more heat from this iron! I have natural hair so it's easier to flat iron and keep straight with a tool that gets hotter and doesn't break my hair when I glide with it. I only use my chi now to curl my ends when I'm done.,1
"I've been wearing Red Door for over 20 years and know the scent well. The bottle I received smelled nothing like it. I don't know if they suddenly changed the  fragrance, or if the bottle was just bad.",0
strong but not offensive smell. It is a large bar and very hard. It should last a while. It does not dry out skin,1
"This shampoo makes my hair look thicker, fuller, and gives
my hair a ton of body, and if I combine it with Nioxin scalp
therapy for fine hair system 1, it works twice as great, it's
an awesome combo. It's worth every penny.",1
"As my hair was growing, I needed a larger size curling iron and when with this one which I purchased in January probably based on reviews and price.  After using for six months, I can not recommend this iron because the heat setting is a little dial on the handle where you hand is.
It is VERY easy to disturb the setting on the dial, which I have done multiple times.  You have to stop and check the dial which have VERY tiny little numbers and fine gradations of temperature,  No digital read out.  No timer.  I am worried about moving  the dial inadvertently too high and having a disaster.  On the plus side, it does make nice beachy loose waves, but I am on the hunt for another brand.",0
"I began using this product the night after a 24 hour international flight (door to door---not 24 hours on one airplane, mind you).  I woke the next morning, looked in the mirror and did not scream as usual after such a long journey.  In other words, my skin looked reasonably plumped and refreshed (and no, I did not get upgraded to business class which would account for a more restful flight...or flightS).  The lotion itself is quite creamy and rich--a little goes a long way.  The only issue is the aroma... a bit too perfumy for my nose.  But...so far...so good!",1
Very good product,1
I really like this self tan because it works and looks natural. The only down side is the smell :( but hey it works really well so that's a plus!,1
"I wasn't sure if I was going to like the colors as I tend to were more grey and blue shades, but I loved them. The color goes on smooth and you don't need a heavy application to get good coverage. I love that I can apply lightly and just highlight my eyes or do a heavy application for a more intense look.

The lighter shades can also be used to highlight check bones as well. Overall, I'm really happy with this brand and shade palette.",1
"Really, Really wanted this to work.  I bought it in February and have been using it as stated.  I didn't see any hair loss.  Very disappointed.",0
"Ouch!  Not thrilled with this nose/ear trimmer at all!  Lots of pulling and snagging of hair.  I prefer the electric models that are on the market and the price point is much higher AND you have to do all the work yourself.  Found that the contraception falls apart easily with the spring coming out.  Makes the trimming process much longer and more frustrating.  Would like for it to cut hair that is outside the ear but that's not possible with this trimmer.  I own a set of J.A, Henckels knives and was so hoping that this product would live up to the quality of those knives.  Cool design, nice and compact and love the included cleaning brush though.  That's why I even gave it the two stars!",0
love it,1
Best product for after the shower! Really makes your hair soft and easy to brush,1
"FRAUD!! I only put one star because I had to provide a rating .. They get no stars from me!! This is the most I've paid for a flat iron thus far and they don't work after one and a half months of having them!! Flat irons that I've purchased from the beauty supply have lasted longer than this. My mind is blown because I haven't even had them for 2 whole months! Should've looked at the reviews before purchasing these knockoffs ! My beautician uses the brand Babyliss and hers are superb. These are not the real thing!!!!! They were acting hesitant to cut on (yes, talking about the flat irons) within my first few weeks of having them and now they just won't cut on... Y'all got me. Hope you enjoy that lil $40 because y'all won't see my money again.",0
I don't believe this is real thing. I have been using this for years and the cream has always been white and creamy. This container I got is yellow and greasy like. I was very disappointed. I will not buy product from this company again. If they have changed it up I'm not aware of it. My daughter just bought some from someone a week or so ago and hers was white and creamy like supposed to be. You might want to check out problem.,0
"This cream is very nice for dry feet.  I have really dry feet with calluses that are not easily softened.  I use this twice daily on my feet and it makes my pedicure appointments more manageable (for me and the technician).  Once I have a pedicure, the use of this product allows me to keep the window between pedicures at 4weeks rather than 3weeks without the glytone in daily use.  My feet feel softer and are easily moisturized when using the glytone.  I have not used it on other parts of my body but on my feet it does a wonderful job.",1
This color is much lighter than it appears on Amazon.  I need to find a way to judge OPI colors better before purchasing from Amazon.  A little disappointed.,1
"Great -- improved the appearance of my skin almost instantly. Not too moisturizing, though... I would not recommend this for people with very dry skin as it is very very light.",1
"I purchased this fragrance due to price.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I sprayed on Legend and it was forgotten in one hour or less.  I cannot detect any smell on me or my clothing.  What is foul is that you cannot return it. Warning,  Be careful!!!!!",0
"Gets globby and impossible to apply after a while. Unfortunately, no thinner available.",1
"I like the color. Only bad thing is that the ""gold cap"" came off, leaving with me a fairly ugly plastic end to the applicator now.  Would give five stars if that hadn't happened (I barely used it).",1
"It adds a beautiful shimmer with light color to any look, transforming the eyes from a conservative work-day look to a fun, sparkly night-time look.",1
I Love the smell.  Very nice! Sprays very fine mist.,1
"Leaves a sort of a lip-balm-type residue, which isn't a problem, but beware if you are applying this where delicate fabrics may come in contact.  The scent is almost like a green tea/very light citrus scent.  Not overpowering and very subtle overall.  You need to apply a lot in order to smell it.  Good product but the best part is the adorable packaging.",1
Burns hair easy,0
I didn't like it at all. It made my wrinkles stand out even more. Its like a cover up & powder at the same time. I didn't feel I got the coverage I needed with it.,0
"Bought this because I thought I had milia and heard this could help. Turns out that's not what this is, so I'm still using this but there's no visible change in my skin, so I can't exactly praise it. It's very gentle, and it says it's an exfoliator, so if you're easily bothered by ones containing grittiness, give this a shot!",1
Wrong product,0
"The color is more grey than purple, but either way, it's still very pretty. The consistency isn't as thick as you'd expect it to be for a gel polish, which is great. It distributes evenly and dries fast.",1
My favorite lotion of all time.  You won't believe how soft your hands feel after using it.,1
I bought this a few times and the most recent one I received was not the same scent as I've used for this product in the past. The old scent was way better. Not sure if they changed it or I got a bad one but the new one sucks.,0
"This DE razor is bigger and heavier that  the Gillette units, but the heavier weight allows me to reduce the pressure on my face which means a nick free shave.",1
"Bought this for my husband and brother in law for Xmas as stocking stuffers, they loved it! Will definately buy again.",1
The smell doesn't last more than an hour I'm afraid.,0
"The best product ever!

I always had long nails but they were so soft that I always broke couple of them which is very frustrated. After a huge research I found this product and was impressed by the reviews. I received it very fast and after the first use I saw the difference. My nails were strong!!! Not stronger but really strong! I didn't need to worry about breaking them anymore. And another big plus is that nails started growing fast! I usually use it under the color (2 coats) and one coat after the color as a protector.

Everyone tells me how beautiful and healthy my nails are! I couldn't be happy. I have used this product for over 2 years now and not going to change)

I recommended it to my friends and mother in law and all of them are in love. It helped them too. So don't hesitate! You would be impressed!",1
"Babyliss products are ""A"" number one.",1
Just one side working... When conect to a eletricity never get hot just warm beacuse one side is not working.,0
"Not the same cleanser that came with the Clarisonic , but works ok, nice fragrance.  A bit pricey.",1
Left my hair filmy and greasy even when I just used a dime sized amount. would not use again on my hair.,0
"I've been somewhat reluctant to try really high-end creams, feeling like the probably aren't so much better than the drug store varieties, but the L'Occitane Immortelle Precious Cream really does leave my face feeling tighter when I apply it. There is a light fragrance to it that dissipates almost immediately, but I have to admit that it makes my makeup look better, and even though I still have pretty oily skin, the moisture soaked in quickly and I don't actually have as much shine as I do when I'm not using it.

This appears to be a new formulation without parabens, but it does have Tetrasodium EDTA which might provoke some reactions in people with sensitive skin and is a derivative of formaldehyde and sodium cyanide, but is also why the product does such a great job penetrating the skin.

For me, I really liked this product and fully expect to purchase my own when I am through with this bottle.",1
oily on hair,0
Love this product,1
This does not work with the machine at all. I assume because they are not original. Waste of money!!,0
Smells great and a great price!,1
"I'm sorry to say my experience wasn't great.  No wavy, beach look for me.  My hair does have some natural wave to it, so I was hoping this would the product that would put it over the edge and give it the great beachy look I've been trying to get.  No such luck.  So my search continues.  I can say I do think it smells okay.  No weird odor that others have mentioned.",0
"This is the best skin cleanser on the market. It is gentle on your skin, does not sting your eyes,and cleans well. It leaves your skin with a nice finish. I highly recommend this product.",1
"Heats up very fast and works very well, even on my very thick hair. This is a flat that I work recommend.",1
"Fake product. smells similiar, but not exactly like the real deal. also clearly smell alcohol in the bottle i received, which is not one of the ingredients listed.",0
"This perfume came damaged.  The bottle had leaked into the packaging and the whole package reeked of Obsession.  The bottle was only 3/4 full because of the leakage, and it was not returnable because apparently returning perfume, even within a few days and with damage, isn't permissible.  This was supposed to be a Christmas gift.  I will never buy perfume from Amazon again.",0
Ok but too strong of a smell for me.  And didn't feel any lasting effects.  Would not recommend.,0
"This is the best deep conditioner if you need A LOT OF TLC! My hair is so damaged fron color treating over the years and the is the most moisturizeing conditioner I've ever found. It makes your hair like butter to comb through.
I have so many Phyto products. Now Phyto is my staple.",1
"I received what looked like the correct product (the same bottle with same information). But when I used it for the first time, I was surprised that it was not purple.  What do I do - this is not what I wanted?  I'm not happy.",0
"To good to be true, I should knew better when I saw the price, don't buy it, fake fake, is water with alcohol only, smell goes away within seconds.
Why they do this????
Not original thing, fake!!!!!!",0
The wife loves them.,1
Three coats later and the color is still not visible. Such a disappointment.,0
"I bought this yesterday and I'm extremely disappointed. A) the way the buttons are, it's easy to turn from high to low; B) the airflow/pressure is very, very LOW; C) the heat is very, very HOT and burns my hand when styling. It did dry my hair quickly, the problem though was it did an awful job of styling my hair. I use a round brush and style my hair to feather back. Today my hair looks AWFUL. I get a much better style with high velocity wind coming out of the dryer. This does not pack that kind of punch. The high setting on this (velocity-wise) is probably lower than the low setting on a $20 1800 watt hairdryer. It's going back.",0
It came earlier than expected and smells great. Will buy again,1
"It is expensive and I did not notice any change in the texture of my skin. Next time I will go for a real retinoic acid instead of an inactive form of it, but doesn't have any scientific evidence behind as collagen burster.",0
"I dislike the tacky feeling of sunscreen & the white tint it leaves behind. By contrast, this product is a real pleasure to wear! I purchased it after I got a few samples from my dermatologist.

Amazing product, but unfortunately the pump didn't work, not even once. It's a huge waste of my time to have to return it for a refund - printing labels, getting boxes, etc. I wish it just worked as expected.",0
Returned didn't like it the silicone on my face,0
Nice daily coverage for any skin type.,1
Don't waste your money. I work out and this product does absolutely nothing. Kind of disappointed.,0
it's ok,1
I started using this product a few months ago and I've noticed a HUGE difference. I have pretty severe KP rubra on my arms and this has helped tremendously. I tried several different products before I found this and none of them even compare to how well this has worked for me. My KP hasn't gone away completely but arms are much smoother. There are still somewhat red but are in much better condition than they were before. I would definitely recommend this product to others dealing the KP!,1
I pay more for this at my dermatology so its great!,1
"I was thrilled to find the absence for such a low price, but I was skeptical because the price for this product is so low.  But it is in fact the product described and it was shipped super fast!  Thank you!",1
"Great color and has nice impact. You could probably reapply color, but I usually don't bother.",1
Using it made literally no difference.,0
I have been using this product for a few years and the last shipment I received of the duo set seemed off.  Both consistencies of the lotions seemed almost gel-like and discoloured with strange smell.  Definitely not the Somme that I am used to receiving.,0
"Blows so lightly, takes forever to dry your hair",0
Very good and my face loves it.,1
They sent me a used product!!! This sunscreen doesn't feel as fluid as the Elta tinted one I used before so I'm also not sure if it's the real deal. It makes my face pretty oily but hasn't broken me out. The pump is already not working. Considering returning it.,0
Not what I expected. It did not cover my grey well. I got dark brown but maybe I should of gotten black. My hair is dark brown so I thought it would work well but not so good.,0
"I've been using this product for 3 weeks now and am actually seeing results - my dark circles are lightening and I thought nothing short of an eye-lift would help.  I'm very pleased with the product and will continue to use it.  Also, it goes a long way unlike some creams.",1
"I like this product, makes my hair softer and gives it shine. Just dab a little on the ends after each wash.",1
"I put this cream on my face according to directions before going to bed. I woke up with my whole face bright red and swollen. Even after I washed it off I still had a rash on my face for a week. I would never again use this junk anywhere on my body, stretch marks or wrinkles, never again! Do yourself a favor and stay away from this horrid chemical junk.",0
Beautiful color. Sparkles and shines. BUT polish chips way to easily.... same day....for the price.,0
"Really soothing and isn't harsh on the skin. Not to mention it smells great! I use it every night after washing my face. It's on the pricey side but, do give it a try if you have sensitive skin. There's NO burning, no irritation. It's gentle and works well with my oily skin!",1
"So, let me start out saying that this stuff smells great and I guess that's worth a star. Unfortunately, it doesn't do a thing to protect my face. I have to use pre shave lotion or my face hurts for hours. Also, since I bought this in a Sephora, I thought I was getting more than what is actually in the tub. It's double walled with a large gap between the bottom of the tub and the bottom of the actual container. The inside is tapered as well. I'll stick to the much cheaper and much better (for me) Taylor of Old Bond Street cream.",0
"This is a life-changing product.  I'm exaggerating, but not by much.  This is super for unclogging any congestion in your skin.  I used it for a week, once a day, and the results were mind-blowing.  I'd say 90% of the congestion went away, and thus I get far fewer breakouts.  One thing to note is that this cleanser is somewhat drying, so I don't recommend that anyone use it twice a day.  After the first couple of weeks, I just started to use it three mornings a week, and it seems enough to upkeep the great results.  I might even start using it 2 mornings a week when winter hits.",1
Really helped my severe acne a lot over the first few days and now it's worse than ever :(,0
works great,1
SUPER SHORT HANDLE!,0
I did not care for the coverage,0
"If I could provide no stars for this product, I would.  I was very excited ordering this eyeliner because it had such excellent reviews. After ten minutes of wearing this eyeliner, I looked like a ghoul.  All of the liner from my top lid dropped below my bottom lid.  Horrible product.  Thank goodness I always try new eye  products at home before being social.  I would not recommend this to anybody and wish I could get my money back.",0
"Not worth $19.99, maybe 9.99!",0
Love it! The moment I put on my skin it feels amazing. Combining with Woda skin care. I am 43 and still have to show my Id. I do microneedling every month.,1
"In my personal opinion, color is good to be used as base for another one.  Didn't like it using it alone-very solid color, no glossy or pearl like finish.",0
Not the same color as pictured. It Is a clear polish with silver sparkles not like the deep purple shown. Do not buy!,0
I like this serum but Prevage products are too pricy for me.,1
"I bought this product and spent a small fortune on it, and only 2 months later,  it no longer works. Because it is outside of the 30 day window, it is not eligible for refund or replacement. It still turns on but will not heat up. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!",0
This was a fake. I've been using forever and this has no smell and seems like water to me.,0
"was recommended by my dermatologist, I like it, and the way it makes my skin feel. Not real sure it's doing anything, but I'll try the whole thing and probably order again",1
Does literally nothing. Tried multiple times. A complete waste of money. Finally threw it out.,0
Just as with most eye creams makes large bags under my eyes and more wrinkles.  I have been using the Ahava aloe body lotion on my face and it makes my face look really good even makes my pores smaller - which I did not know was possible.  I thought since the body lotion was so good I would try to eye cream and to my surprise made matters worse.  I will continue my vitamin e cream and the aloe body lotion.  tired of spending a small fortune for disappointment.,0
"I tried this after having used the body washes, which  I liked very much. Good scent, good lather, but after rinse off, left my skin felling like wax paper. Now I'm stuck with this big bar of I will not use this ever again soap.  Maybe if they added an ingredient to smooth out that waxy finish I might  try again.",0
Good hair dryer. It takes time to break it in like most. I like a really hot hair dryer and felt like this one did well after using it a few times. I compared it recently to my old conair and the air flow and heat were much better. I've had the BaByliss Pro over a year now and it still works as well as when I first got it. I would buy one again.,1
"I thought this handcream would help plump up my fingers, but it doesn't do a good a job as regular Cetaphil lotion. I was very disappointed.",0
"Very small amounts, although the packaging is cute for a gift or stocking.",0
very good stuff and works great on face. so glad found that amazon has those as department store no longer carries them.,1
"I want a good product, It was wrong because this Iron Curling Does not work.
for people who live outside the USA not a smart desicion making this purchase",0
"These are the only hair vitamins that I have ever noticed a difference with. The biggest difference is my hair feels stronger, less shedding, and it is shinier. It also makes my nails grow but I don't really care about that...I care about my mane! I am a little egocentric about my hair.

They are not obnoxious to take, actually taste quite good. The reality is that you only improve your hair, you are unable to change it. This will not turn fine hair into a coarse lion's mane (wish it did...) but it has helped me with my hair becoming duller, thinner, and a little lifeless as I have gotten older.

It does take time but that time is going to pass anyway....these little yummy pills, eating healthy, and a basic multi- vitamin do make a big difference in the quality of  my hair,skin,and nails.",1
"It's really refreshing, although I don't really think it does anything special to my skin. I like to spritz after I wash my face off and then put toner and moisturizer or I use this to wet my beauty blender. This product doesn't do anything so special for my skin, but it refreshes your face.",1
"Does have anything want to comment, awful product.",0
I love this. My nail tech used it so I could dash out the door after a polish... and it dried so fast! I was so happy and I liked it so much I bought it for myself. Its so easy... just fill the dropper and drip onto each nail. Give it a minute and go!,1
"For the price, this product does not even live up to Jergen's - and where is the scent ? Save your money.",0
"This is all I have used on my nails for years, so happy to find at a lower price.  I will order again",1
"This came spoilt in the plastic bag, horrible. A waste of money",0
Product is fake.  The dispenser is a different color and the serum is too clear with a different smell and texture.  Real Cellex C is amazing product that works well - been using it for years.,0
It was twice as much and isn't working as well as my last tube. Ugh  $150.00,0
Did not really do anything significant... love their masks but didn't feel like this product was worth it.,0
Better than Evian,1
"This primer is amazing. I literally used this under $0.99 lipstick and it stayed on all night. I did not have to reapply once! I also wrote it through eating and drinking and it still kept it on when normally I would have had to reapply several times.
However I did not notice any plumping but that doesn't bother me.",1
"Don't use too much or it will cause scalp itch. I put a light dusting of the material on my hand, then apply that at the roots of my hair. Product gives it body and height (for fine, inert hair with a good cut). It looks like cocaine and is nearly as expensive! So only use a dusting by hand at first. Can always add more later.",1
Light (non-greasy) and smooth.  The surface of my skin doesn't feel chalky or dried-out as in the case of some other sunscreen products.  My combination skin feels hydrated and soft !,1
"The best hair dryer I have ever used.  Quiet, and fast!  Hair looks better than ever!",1
"This set does not contain the posted colors, NOR does it contain lipstick or eyeliner. Very deceiving when you place your order then open your package. The colors are a lilac and baby pink, which are very pretty, but are most definitely not the ones shown. Worst of all, is the false advertising for lipstick and eyeliner that is down in the display. It should say not included or something to indicate you only get polish.",0
"I bought this verson of L'Occitane's shea butter because I have reallly dry feet. It works fine and does what it claims, however it has a pretty strong florally smell that some people may not like. I usually purchase L'Occitane's shea butter in the tub and use it pretty much everywhere (face, feet, hands, etc). The tub version has 25% shea butter where this foot cream has only 15%. In the future I will just buy the regular version in the tub and not the foot cream. It works better, does not smell and I only need to buy one product, not two.",1
I ordered the wrong product. I wanted the Coola with tint in it.  This  is nice also tho.,1
Sticky. They changed the formula. Added bad chemicals. Wont be buying again,0
I have dark brown hair and light skin. I've used this product 5 tines in a two month period. It has produced absolutely no results whatsoever. I am deeply dissatisfied considering the price. My advise is to look elsewhere. Don't waste your hard earned cash.,0
Perfect color for the summer! Mermaid green.,1
"I had ordered the sampler kit of this product and loved the Not A Perfume sample.  However,  the full bottle does not smell as good at all.  Very disappointed in the product, especially for the price.  I should have just ordered another sample kit.",0
"I thought this product would smooth out fine lines and maybe help a little with discoloration, but it did nothing.  It is not worth the price.  When I wore it alone, it made no difference in my appearance, when I wore it under make up, it made my face greasy.  Boo.",0
"I like this scent a lot; it is clean and light, not cloying. It actually has decent staying power too. I'm taking off a star because the bottle is horrible. This is a substantial amount of perfume, but the container is unstable (narrow) so it easily tips. The top is incredibly heavy and looks like a gear shift knob, making the container even less stable. And the tacky, stiff plastic ""bow tie"" around the neck of the bottle makes it even more difficult to handle. Last but not least, the spritzer doesn't work properly.

I ordered this online, so never had a chance to check out the bottle -- if I had, I probably wouldn't have bought it.",1
"Nope. Didn't help my acne. I'm 28 and I break out frequently and I've always read good reviews about this stuff online, but it didn't help me. And it smells like sulfur. Disappointed.

=(",0
"I travel a lot, and in some climates where it's dry, I have issues with dryness around my eyes.
This is the only thing I've found so far that makes it better, keeps it moist and stops the
flaking and peeling that sometimes occurs.  It's expensive for such a little tube, but a tiny
dab does the trick.  I'm glad I found it.",1
"I like this very much.  For such a light product, the coverage is excellent.  It covered the shine and minor skin imperfections, was very easy to apply (I used a brush) and lasted all day.  I think it is well worth the price and I'm sure I'll be purchasing it again.",1
"I received this product first as a sample in a monthly make-up subscription. I fell in love with it but was very wary of the price tag.

I have very large pores, prone to a monthly breakout, and have lingering acne scars. I can hardly wear any make-up for fear it'll break me out or will settle into my pores making them look worse. This stuff is amazing. It drastically reduces the size of my pores while moisturizing my skin.

However, I can't use it everyday as my skin starts to get overly hydrated and borders on greasy. Also, the full price is a hard price to swallow. It'll last you forever and a day however.",1
I love this product,1
"I never thought I would buy something with bad quality on AMAZON.
This cologne smells good , but lasts a few minutes only ...Scent does not stays...
I really think this is fake or diluted in water...
I am disappointed with the purchase",0
"This light weight leave in conditioner works great to tame the frizzies and unleash the curls.  I let my hair dry naturally and it just looks curly and fabulous. There's no stiffness, wet look or oiliness when my hair is dry.",1
Should have read the reviews before I purchased this. Apparently I'm not the only one who thinks it smells like nothing. It's like someone took the empty bottles and refilled them with water and a bit of alcohol. What a waste of money. I thought that was illegal..?,0
"I've used Blinc for several yrs. I have gas permable contacts & don't have a problem with the mascara. If someone does maybe it's an allergy to the product.
The ease of removal is what keeps me buying more!! Old types of mascara melt & get in my eyes upon removal",1
"Did not work well with my hair at all, it did not hear up, and it takes FOREVER too about 2 hours. Stick with buying a hot tools or chi straightner you'll be more satisfied.",0
"This made my fine hair greasy, even when only using a tiny amount.  Phyto makes great products, this is just not good for fine limp hair.  Would recommend for coarse curly hair needing taming.",0
"I have only been using it for about the week.  I have not noticed any difference, but guessing it will take longer than a weeks use.  It does have a very mediciney smell which I do not like, wish it smelled better.  I also have sensitive skin but have not noticed reddness or tingling with the use as mentioned by other.  I only apply a small amount though.  Hoping with more use will see results.",1
"I know this was supposed to be a travel size, but I fully expected that there would be more than a few days worth of product - specifically the dragon blood sculpting gel (red container).  Very disappointed.  I've gotten more uses out of the foil packet testers that get thrown in for free during in-store give aways.  I won't purchase this kit again and would only recommend if you already know you like their stuff.  You can't get a good idea from this.",0
the cover is broken. and it should not be sealed if it is new?,0
"This stuff is great. This is the only soap I've found that can scrub my deodorant off.
I love this stuff.",1
"This file seemed pretty good at first. It left smooth edges, shaped nicely, and got the job done quickly. Unfortunately, the last time I used it it snapped in half, though I was not exerting an unusual amount of force or bending it in any way. I expected a bit more longevity considering the brand and the price.",0
Love it for fine thin hair,1
I was not pleased with is product. I had also purchased the jirmach silver shampo and it worked much better.,0
Very pasty looking! difficult to make the color look even on nails.,0
"Seems as if it dries out very quickly although I am careful to put the lid on securely each time I use it.  I have been using the brow color that is in a mascara-type tube, which happens to be easier for me.",1
"replacement bottle for my mom, who i gave this to last year and she used it all up!",1
"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1
Suuuuuuuper soft and smells delicious.,1
Love it!!,1
"Very pricey and it doesn't' seem to be doing ANYTHING to help my skin. The collagen cream, which is quite a bit less expensive,was a better product.",0
"The ""light brown"" is very reddish colored. I have light brown hair but could not use this because the color was so red.",0
Chips easily even with correct manicure preparation and paring with other zoya products,0
Smells good,1
"Heavy, not hot enough and stopped working within 8 months of use. For the price it should last longer.",0
"This is my second time buying this exact difuser. last time within the first month or so the metal part inside that helps dry your hair just fell out. I continued to use it for a while . This one arrived  and after a month or two of using it parts of the inside that help it attached to the dryer and stay on are breaking off. It is funny too, because I have a babyLiss pro hair dryer and the  noth diffusers did not quite fit on there. so, it eeally usnt a universal fit. good luck. I will save my money and just stick with a cheaper diffuser from now on.",0
"I have curly hair, but not kinky, the product says it would reduce the curl by 70 to 80% and reduce the volume. The first couple of days it was alright, smooth with a little bit of curl, which I like. But, just like the Keratin treatment I had in the past it went back to normal within a week. At least with the Keratin treatment your hair stays very soft and frizz-free for a while. My hair is still thick and curly and now it's even heavier because of the treatment. This did nothing to help or change my hair the way I wanted it to or expected it to. I even had a professional do it for me who went to cosmetology school, she knew what she was doing and read the directions. I emailed the customer service line, and asked what should I expect with this product, because usually with Keratin treatments at least the blow-dry time is a lot faster. He responded ""blow drying and flat ironing always give the best results, so try that"" no sh** that's why I bought the product in the first place. So I wouldn't have to blow dry and straighten my hair as often, and also recommending I buy their brand blow dryer and flat iron. Why, to spend more money for the same results. Right. Don't waste your money. As much as I love natural products, we can only go so far with it and if that were the case we'd all have exactly what we want without ever having to step foot in a salon.",0
The new product that replaced pure volume was horrible. The product made my hair flat and greasy. Please bring back the original formula!!!!!!!!!,0
Color is never even close to the picture,0
"I use this after EVERY shower, on days I don't style I just spray it directly into damp hair and on days I do I spritz my hand and apply it loosely after I flat iron. It controls frizz and even supplies hold so I don't even need hairspray anymore !! I've noticed softer hair and even richer color in days I leave the spray out so I know its working wonders plus my ends never split ! HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",1
Great for hair.,1
Love this shampoo - it truly helps my color last longer and I love it's light smell!,1
"Received only mens samples, mostly for cologne. Like other reviewers, foil packs and single cologne samples. Very disappointed!! Nothing I can use or even try. Wouldnt do this again.",0
"Noticeable difference, when ever used.",1
Luxury samples?  Not quite.  Disappointed in the quality  - nothing more than samples,0
This is my go to color I bring to the salon! It is the prettiest semi matte white with a tiny tiny of lilac.,1
"Don't purchase this item!  I bought one for a Christmas gift and before Christmas took it out to charge it and familiarize myself with ahead of time.  I'd you do not insert the unit in its charging cradle just right, it will not charge.  And there's no indicator to signal that it is charging.  I charged it all night and when morning came it was still dead.  I kept fidgeting with it and finally got a little bit charged but two days later have been unable to get it to. Barge again.  I'm sending this back.  If I purchase a more expensive one maybe it's more user friendly.",0
"This is not quite the color I was looking for and it's definitely not matte, however, it's a beautiful color and goes on smoothly and lasts.  I'll will definitely shop more stila eye shadows. (I've been strictly MAC for years.)",1
"I really love this top coat! I get 7 days of wear and I consider myself pretty active. Only negative is that you will only get about half the use out of the bottle. After so many coats, the polish turns to a glue consistency.",1
"Such a refreshing facial spray that almost feels as if it's tightening the skin all together, can never apply too much as a simple here and there goes a long way may look to by again when finished .",1
"Not seeing any results after 3 weeks
Will not buy again",0
I dig all my Jack Black products and this is my fave for a clean face.,1
Great product-love it!,1
Loved it!,1
Favorite daily sunscreen. A little bit goes a long way with this (about a pea size covers my face) and I don't feel it at all. No greasy/oily residue whatsoever :) - Also works great on my 8 month old; doesn't bother his skin and keeps him safe!,1
"I find it strangely odd that everyone who gave this product a fantastic review:

1. Has only ever reviewed one product on Amazon

2. All seem to have been posted on the 24th.

Caveat emptor.",0
"At first I LOVED this shampoo! Made my hair super light and clean. Very manageable and the smell I could get over pretty easily. I have eczema all over my body and in my scalp so this cleared it up very well in fact!
However! Fair warning! After a while of using it my hair started to actually get greasy after less time than usual! And to my absolute HORROR turned my scalp orange! BRIGHT ORANGE! Also I noticed my scalp was sort of tender when It put my hair up. And this of course prompted me to stop using it! I then washed my hair with a different brand shampoo and the water turned the color of RUST!
It left my scalp with tiny orange flakes all over which took almost 2 weeks to go away! And now my hair gets greasier way faster than it used to.

Super disappointing as it worked so incredibly well for the first week or two! Don't say I didn't warn you!",0
"excelente perfume aroma muy fresco no muy dulce y le encanta a las mujeres, recomiendo usar en das lluviosos o frescos, fiestas no muy formales, bares- sitios nocturnos son sitios donde el olor grandioso de esta colonia sobresale, sin embargo en das calurosos puede el olor ser muy intenso y molestar si hay sobreaplicacion o a corta distancia.....excellent fresh aroma scent not too sweet and loves women, I recommend to use on rainy days or cool, not too formal parties, bars, nightclubs are places where the great smell of this colony stands, though on hot days can the very intense smell and hassle if there OVERCOATINGS or short",1
"What has happened to this product? My skin esthetician recommended Replenix Neckleage 6 months ago and I loved it. The lavender fragrance was lovely and every use was like a spa treatment. The results were amazing! However, when I ordered on-line, the product I received had a terrible fragrance  similar to a bad chemical smell. I sent it back, waited a month thinking maybe I had gotten a bad batch. The new jar just arrived and it has the same icky smell. This product is expensive and I do not feel comfortable putting something that distasteful on my delicate skin. So disappointed.",0
"VERY GOOD PRODUCT, SMELLS GOOD AND KEEPS HAIR SMOOTH.",1
Just what I needed...,1
"I like this stuff. Some other folks have pointed out that they feel like it's a bit ""oily"" or ""greasy"" - I actually think it lacks any of the usual sunscreen greasiness, and I think what they're noticing is the silicones. This does feel like it sits on stop of the skin a bit, but it feels more like a moisturizing makeup primer to me. I have combination skin and that doesn't bother me - I just put a bit of translucent powder over my t-zone and wear it like it's makeup. It's easy to put on and I feel like I can put on a pretty sizeable amount and still have it blend nicely - I have really fair skin and that's not always the case with tinted sunscreens for me! The tint works perfectly - really subtle, doesn't turn me orange, just prevents any white cast.

That said, I've only been using this in fall and winter. It's very possible that I'll have to look for something that sinks in a bit more for the summer.",1
amazing self tanner! looks really natural and lasts a long time. the fact that it only takes three hours is a major plus. it also smells nice. i will definitely be buying more of this.,1
Bought it for a gift and she loved it!!,1
the shade is what I wanted but it's too shiny,0
Didn't work for me and just left my hair feeling dry/stripped. Maybe I need to use with the entire system.,0
"Did not stay on well,",0
Don't see any change in quality of water. Bought it especially for washing my hair and filtering impurities.,0
great smell,1
"I needed something that lasts after meals. I have had a bad habit to rub and bite my lips along the day so that lipstick doesn't stay long, as well. This does the trick, absolutely. It almost soaks into the lips the second it touches. It doesn't exactly dye them but really stick and be with them in one? Lol
I warn you that it soaks in so fast and cling so fast you have to be really careful( meaning, not in the moving car, not with little kids around)applying because once you make a mistake it's going to be hard to remove it. Yes, that much lasting! Lol
I picked Amore and it's a bit darker than i would have liked( i was going for bronze) but after one coat of this, I apply light bronze(l'oreal that claims lasting, too. That's a little pearly one so they work well together because, another warning : it is matte type. No pearl, no shining) on top of it so it's ok.  Smells good, too.
A bit expensive but so worth it. I might try different colors later.",1
"Its user friendly.  But this product must use together with its hair products eg heat resistant products so hairs wouldn't get worse after using it.  Its inexpensive so you won't feel disappointed with it.
Not recommended for very dry hairs anyway.",1
Works well.  I use this at night & my lips feel great all the next day.,1
"My current fav mascara. Lengthening, not voluminous. I have super oily and hooded eye lids, this doesn't transfer to the top of my eyelid. stays on all day.",1
"I hardly ever write any review but this one I feel I have to.
This is horrible and worst makeup product I have ever purchased and used. It is just oil. Not absorbed and just stay on your lid and moving.
I tried on bare skin and over some shadows. I got melt down to my eyes and so things got blurred. Swear I just put very little with one swipe.
Today I put them over the shadow because I didn't want to waste it. However, my eye shadows, linders and mascara are all moving and I turned to look like a raccoon and dirty. I didn't have a dark smoky eye makeup. This is horrible product. I got a Dewy. Can't imagine what the other colored item would do on my face.",0
I do like how long it makes my lashes but i don't like the brush. The mascara gets clumped on the brush.,1
"This product does not hold the fibers in place.... plus, it does not smell good",0
"very good product, description is the same that the seller, work pefect",1
Another fabulous La Roche-Posay product!!! I'm so glad Allure readers recognized how great this acne cream is! It is the best spot treatment available! It works as good as the prescription products!,1
"I purchased this accidentally when I was trying to order Re:coil.  I won't make that mistake again.  The Re:coil product works perfectly for my thick, curly hair and this just doesn't.

For an excellent review that mirrors my own experience, please reference the one written by Amechania.  She states very succinctly what I would have said.",0
"Bought for my baby. Works great on her skin, its very nourishing and smells good!",1
"I had heard great comments on this cologne, but I was shocked the scent was so faint ... no one even noticed it, not even my girlfriend who had stick her nose on my neck to smell it. Who knows, maybe it was an old bottle",0
Bought on Prime time days at a 30% discount. Good Product.,1
"From other comments it seems it's a 50/50 you get the original or something diluted, I got the diluted....it smelled good for the first 10 min, after that goes away, just buy it at a official retail store",0
"This is a fantastic, really dark color. I'm fair and the color is very nice on me. Goes on well and coverage is good. Only draw back, can't make mistakes with this one. Keep your correction pen close by.",1
"Super big hair. I Love this stuff. and the shine and bounce my hair has is amazing. great, great product. even on my fine hair that usually gets weighted down so easily.",1
No difference what so ever.  Turned to a Vit C product that worked much better.  Walmart has a generic if you still want to try it.  Don't know if that one works either,0
I didn't care for the fragrance.,0
"I LOVE the LONDON Butter line and have several colors. I ordered this one with the hopes that it would have a purple shade to it like in the picture but it goes a muted, silver, kind of sparkly, pale color. Not impressed with this color.",0
This was way too much money to pay for something that doesnt work like its suppose to. It didn't help my hair at all. and I slept in t twice.,0
My go to nude pink! So simple and pretty! Has a nice sheen and is a great neutral color.,1
Smells great,1
"Did not notice any difference in pigmentation, fine wrinkles or smoothness of skin",0
"Was looking for a lotion with a lasting scent, but didn't find it with this product.",0
"This is a weird product. It really coats your eyelashes, and when you remove it, it comes off in long black pieces that coated your lashed. It did have great coverage. But it made my lashes feel really hard, not natural, it made me loose eye lashes as I removed it, and it made my lashes feel dry.",0
Really cute and I love the colors!,1
"This is a fantastic product. Yes...a bit expensive and that's what keeps it from being 5 stars. Otherwise, it is fantastic for treating hair and keeping it healthy and shiney!",1
It was not what i was expecting,0
"Didnt not work for me at all. Still have dandruff that doesnt wash away after I use it as directed. I wish I could return it and get full refund, but",0
"Nice color and smooth application, but it does not stay on past a few hours.",0
First time I used this product last night and apart from not noticing much difference to normal volumising mascaras - I'm paying for it with painful eyes the next morning. The tubes are hard to get off and of course end up in your eyes. My eyes are so sore I had to cancel my plans today and can barely see. Horrible product. Please be careful when using.,0
"I saw this product advertised in a fashion magazine as being fantastic as an overnight mask for your hair.  My hair is color treated and fine textured.  My skin also tends to be on the dryer side so I am a fan of oils for hydration.  I use Argan oil for my skin but the scent isn't great.  I have used Moroccan oil and it never ""wowed"" me.
The scent of this magnolia oil is wonderful but strong.  I have used it around my eyes and as a body oil after shower.  As for my hair I apply to clean damp hair and let soak over night.  It's nice to be able to apply a small amount throughout hair and wake up to hair that isn't oily and in need of a wash.  My hair is less frizzy and is absolutely more hydrated.  I have yet to apply a generous amount wrap in warm towel and let soak over night merely because I haven't needed too.  It works fantastic in small amounts.  This is a nice size bottle and will last a long time.
The reason I did not rate it as a 5 star is because I do not care for this oil as a make up remover around my eyes as advertised in the packaging.",1
Luv this  product! !l,1
Fragrance is too masculine for me.,0
Great product - very fast delivery - thanks!,1
"I've had eczema for years, mostly induced by diet. I've tried everything under the sun. Everything. This is an honest review. This stuff is the only cream/lotion/topical product I have used that has made a huge difference on my skin. Diet is the biggest way that I've seen my skin clear up but this is second.",1
Just ok,0
I returned this.,0
"Came out clumpy with no fragrance. I'm not sure what I put on my hair, but it certainly wasn't a quality Matrix Biolage product. Thought it could have been the oil causing the clumps and that it was labeled as ""unisex,"" so no typical Biolage sent. However, I just smelled the same conditioner at the store, and it is definitely supposed to have a nice sent like the other Biolage products. Wasted my money. I'll just continue to buy my Biolage in store.",0
"I bought this for my girlfriend and twice had to return it. After working a couple of times, the device would just stop turning on.",0
"I use it on dry hair to smooth the frizzies
great smell too!",1
"As described, Came on time...would order again.",1
My wife has been using this stuff regularly for years and swears by it. She normally gets it from her hairdresser but bought it here since it was notably cheaper.,1
This is a great moisturizer for acne skin. Not oily at all but very moisturizing.,1
"This is a wonderful hair product.  Nothing too heavy or gunky, but enough oomph to style your hair.  It is often recommended for curly hair, however mine is pretty straight with lots of grey (which kind of takes on a texture of it's own) and I find it perfect for taming my hair.  No strong scent is a plus.  I would be giving it five stars if it came with a pump dispenser.  I have weak hands and getting the product out of the large bottle is a bit of problem.  Love the fact that my hair feels natural and not crunchy or oily after applying.",1
"Great brush! I have very thick, long, wavy hair and this brush straightened my hair out with ease. Great price too!",1
this product it is not even curl or working. too expensive . full refund.  Don't buy this hot tools. I wasn't please with the result,0
LOVE this! First thing I have found that works wonderfully on stubborn cystic acne. Wish I would have discovered this years ago!,1
"Currently working my hair from dark brown and red to grey/silver so my hair has been lightened several times in the past 8 weeks. I've been using this shampoo and conditioner in my routine (and rotating between these and some others). My hair is dryer than pre-lightening but that's to be expected. It doesn't feel ""crispy"" though which is a definite plus! Also, coming from the browns and reds I expected more brassy tones which I haven't had in my hair. Wish this was a little more hydrating but overall very happy with it.",1
"I purchased two of these. One for myself and one for my daughter. After a very short time the Clarisonic will not hold a charge. I made the mistake of ordering extra brush heads and will never get the opportunity to use those. The warranty is up, this product will NOT hold a charge, and the first brush head is still new looking a.k.a., we got very little use from the product before it became non-functional. Save your money or you too will own very expensive paper weights.",0
"I was impressed with the texture and pattern of the Navy Shatter, so I purchased this color, loving how it looked in the bottle. Well, this DOESN'T SHATTER. It took me several tries of removing polish and reapplying it (a big waste of polish and time) to get the effect I wanted. I found that I had to use very little of it to get it to shatter and even then, it barely had a pattern.

VERY disappointed. I would never have expected this from a well known brand like OPI.",0
waste of money,0
This product is very effective. My dark sport within 3 weeks had removed it .,1
"I try to use products with very simple and clean ingredients but this is the one product I break my own rules for because it works so darn well, doesnt irritate my skill, and doesnt suffocate you even though it feels thick. The perfume is noticeable whereas I usually use unscented EVERYTHING but its not overwhelming and even I can deal with it. I keep looking for a different product with less of those unhealthy ingredients but still works as well but I haven't found it.",1
I love this cream. It is much better than neutrogena and I am glad I gave it a try. It does not irritate my skin and works well under makeup. A perfect primer with high spf. Perfect. I am hooked.;),1
STrong so be careful,1
"I don't have a problem with crepiness, but I am beginning to see the very beginnings of something resembling it under my upper arms. Like yuck! (Aging really sucks.)

Naturally I'd be for anything that would forestall it. I was glad to try the Crepe Erase two part system (despite the name, which gives me the heebies.) The moisturizer is OK, the scrub like most average scrubs. So all I have to do is use a scrub and moisturize and it'll all be fine? Because regardless of what the company claims, after several weeks, I see zero change in my incipient underarm crepiness. If this product is supposed to make a difference, it's not doing a thing I can see.

Two stars cause the products aren't horrible, but minus three stars cause I don't see that they do at all what the manufacturer claims. You can get a similar result a lot cheaper with almost any moisturizer and sugar scrub for a LOT less. Pass.",0
This is a great way to dabble into some of the most popular products from theBalm.  The packaging is very cute and the color/pigmentation is excellent.  I'm enjoying having the small sizes since makeup is so hard to use up anyway.,1
Has good scent & lathers well.,1
"I can't believe the great reviews on this lotion.  This stuff has the consistency of a thick paste that just does not absorb at all. Blech!  I can not believe how expensive this is and so far, I see no improvements in my skin at all.  I will use the remainder of course since it was $60, but how very disappointing!!",0
"Not a good nude for my pale skin.
Do You Take Lei Away?
Idk what Lei is but no I don't.",0
great product,1
"One star because the pump stopped working after maybe the first three pumps.  Very irritating considering I had already put the product on parts of my arms. So then I basically tried as hard as I could to squeeze the liquid out to do the rest of me so I wouldn't look ridiculous.  Disaster.  I called XenTan directly hoping they could help exchange it faster or send me a free one for my trouble while I exchanged the bad one via Amazon.  The girl was zero help.  Asked me for the lot number and said since I bought it through Amazon there is nothing they can do.
The only redeeming thing I can say is that from what product I did get on myself I left on for 4 hours then rinsed off.  I only had a slight self tanner smell after breaking a little sweat, gone by the next day.  However the color was very subtle.  Hard to say if I really got enough on, it was basically in liquid form for me.  I did order the mitt and used that to apply it, that probably saved me from being completely blotchy since I never got a ""foam"" experience.  I'm exchanging it and will update my review once I get the next bottle.  Since I'm so desperate to find a self tanner that doesn't have a horrible smell, I'm willing to give this another try.  Thus the second star.",0
My all time favorite hairspray,1
Adult male has been using this for years.  Usually doesn't care about brands-buys whatever from the grocery store.  There is something about this product that he really likes--it works and smells good.,0
Great iron..pricey but worth it,1
"I got a discount to review this product. I used to use a clarisonic but to travel with, it's a pain. This is a lot easier to travel with and has a pretty gentle, but effective scrub. You can use any product with it, but I found exfoliating scrubs aren't really as useful as a regular face wash with this. Definitely made my shave a lot smoother and better.",1
I like this but not I tried something similar in the same brand and I liked it better,0
I love the smell and I can really tell the difference on how soft my skin is compared to the store bought brands!,1
"I didn't care for the scent. 2 stars because it's a nice shaving cream. Other reviews said they liked the fragrance and I purchased. My 9 yr old daughter summed it up perfectly. ""Dad... you smell like a doctor office.""",0
"I was skeptical but my nails were so bad I had to try it on a friend's rec. After a bottle, I stopped for 2 months and that made me purchase another bottle. They are expensive, yes. And not they are not magic. But they do work. When I stopped my nails went right back to being very thin and my hair isn't as lush. I have plenty of hair but my nails have been a mess for a year and while they didn't grow long or anything, they definitely strengthened.",1
Nice style curling iron but did not seem to be able to put the slightest curl in my hair. I have another kind the same size but much cheaper where I am able to get curl and body.,0
"This is the first DE razor I've ever owned (still is).

I've been using it for a few months with great results.  I really like the weight of it.  It certainly feels sturdy!

It's easy to clean, and easy to use.  I really can't ask much more from a razor.",1
Heat quit working after 5 months  otherwise a good dryer,0
"Oops, I just submitted a review for the dark tanning mousse.  This one looked great for a couple of weeks then my legs went all splotchy.  It looked awful and I couldn't even scrub it off with a loofa.  It took a couple of weeks to be back to my white self without any splotches.",0
"This ""Foreo Issa Hybrid"" toothbrush, which costed over $200 after taxes, is a DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. The metal peg which holds the brush onto the motorized handle SNAPS OFF, with routine usage, rendering the unit USELESS. Their supposed ""10 year warranty"" is a LIE, and the non-responsive ""customer service"" in the USA is a pathetic joke. STAY AWAY FROM THIS OVERPRICED, GARBAGE PRODUCT with A LIE of a ""warranty"".",0
Product is extremely thick and grainy. Might as well be using chunky peanut butter in your hair. Very disappointed with this product. A true waste of money.,0
"Luxury shampoo with low sudsing rich lather, and very little scent. This was very pleasant to use on my platinum/white hair, keeping it soft, with some nice natural shine. The tube is really huge, and a little went a long way on my very short hair. I would guess the tube will last 4-6 months.

Expensive, but definitely worth a try if you are having salon color done regularly and want to offer your hair some extra-kind care.",1
It works! Very very good product.,1
Great curls.  Takes awhile since only a small amount of hair can curl at a time but results are much better than any other styling tool used.,1
bad,0
Nice quality. Looked good and felt good. Liked the natural look. Dried quickly. Had another brand stay on longer/ chip less but it wasn't a French look.,1
Received faster than I can blink an eye.. Very lightly scented and no greasy feel.. doesn't give as much shine as I hoped but it will do for now,1
It was ok.  Nothing to jump up and down for.,0
"This is great, except DO NOT try to put too much hair in at a time.  It got tangled in my hair and I almost had to cut a big chunk out.",1
Bought for my dad. He loves it!,1
"Very expensive, kinda hurts, but it works.  Slowly covering my body with laser beams!",1
Nothing special. .. especially for the price.,0
"Usually creamy conditioners won't work for my thin, slightly oily hair. Never have been able to use them!  I usually always check them out in the store!  Bought this one online on the advice of reviewers and I am so happy I did!  I really love it!  I use it in combination with the Sebastian Volupt Volume Boosting  shampoo and they do an awesome job of giving me more volume and not weighing my hair down.  No added oilyness  either!  Really glad I took reviewers advice!  I always read the reviews and buy accordingly on amazon!",1
Great toner,1
a very good product !!!,1
This item came in a plastic bag with a tie on it.  The contents of the bottle was leaking.  I don't think I got a new product.,0
"They changed the formula majorly since all of these awesome reviews. Before the ingredients were:

Deionized Water (Aqua),Aloe (Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice) Vera Gel,Bladderwrack (Fucus Vesiculous) Extract,Herbal Extract,Rose (Rosa Gallica) Extract,Gardenia (Gardenis Florida) Extract,Propylene Glycol.

The new ingredients are:
Aqua (Water,Eau),Propylene Glycol,Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice,Rosa Canina Extract,Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Leaf Extract,Fucus Vesiculosus Extract,Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract,Caprylyl Glycol,Hexylene Glycol,Polysorbate 20,Parfum (Fragrance),Phenoxyethanol,Sodium Chloride,Citronellol,Geraniol,CI 17200 (Red 33),CI 42090 (Blue 1)

They've added way more of the glycols, propylene glycol used to be the last ingredient and now it's second, which is room for concern (glycols are alcohols and alcohols are drying), and now ethanol is in it (an even worse alcohol). Ethanol makes products quickly dry which makes them feel weightless on the skin for cheap... HOWEVER, ethanol causes irritation to the skin and is bad for ALL skin types, which you will see if you buy this product. Just do a google search and see for yourself. Some alcohols are okay, but not ethanol! I have very clear skin and never have bad breakouts. My skin is not sensitive and I really never worry about using anything on it because it's just rarely an issue. The day after I used this I had a terrible breakout, worse than any other skin product ever has. I'm really disappointed and wish I could get my hands on the old formula that everyone loved so much.",0
does not flake and has serious holding power. I have use this for years. I also like that it has no oder after it dries.,1
Beautiful color. nice sheer coverage.,1
"This body lotion leave the skin feeling like silk - love it! The smell, ahh the smell is wonderful!",1
The only mascara that doesn't run down my face ,1
"This stuff is pretty darn good. Not greasy or shiny at all. The first couple applications it seems kinda ""dry"" but once you get past that it goes on super smooth & gives the slight sensation of menthol. I got this because I tried the yu-be skin cream & fell in love with it- even used it on my lips- so I figured if this was anything like that I wouldn't be disappointed, and I'm not. Great product!",1
"I am absolutely thrilled with this mascara.  The grey shade was applied by a Jane Iredale makeup artist at my dermatologist's office.  Because I'm quite pale and black mascara makes me look like a clown.  If you have tried to find a good brown mascara---good luck; the closest one can purchase is ""brownish black"" or ""black brown"".  However, Cover Girl does make some plain brown mascara that isn't bad, but I've not felt the quality was not as good as this particular Jane Iredale mascara.  IF this mascara needs to be reapplied it's only if I go out again in the evening.

I was not acquainted with Jane Iredale products previously and am sold on them for the most part.  The product colors are very flattering and soft, so I've become quite attached to this line.  I'm 72 years old and people tell me I look at least ten years younger, but because my pink tinged very fair skin it has been a challenge to find makeup that only enhances my natural face color rather than making me look silly. I wish I could buy everything I'd like!!!  Thank you Jane Iredale!",1
Believe the Hype !! As a series Fraghead this is niche quality juice . Back up bottle worrty . But it before the price goes up excellent blend of honey and tobacco. Define rly a winter fragrance will project excellently in cold weather.,1
"I have my hair cut to specifically show off my pure white and silver streaks in my graying hair.  This conditioner actually dulls the streaks, to the point that my hair looks dirty within 3 hours.  I also have very fine hair.  This conditioner weighs it down and my hair looks greasy/stringy/dirty within 3 hours.

I purchased this on a the recommendation from a hairstylist at ULTA.  I will say it does last a long time.

I use Matrix So Silver as my shampoo a few times a week.  When I use Shiny Silver conditioner along with the So Silver, women actually stop me in stores to compliment the color of my hair.  The other days I use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.  I also found that deep conditioning my hair every couple of weeks helps with the dryness/breakage that comes with naturally gray hair.

I'm a woman who lived with ugly dishwater blond hair and dyed it the majority of her life.  When I saw how the gray was coming in, I cut it all off so I didn't have to deal with the root situation and I've never looked back.  This conditioner just makes me want to start dying my hair again.",0
"This item is NOT feather weight! I bought it because I wanted a light hair dryer, I returned it because it feels heavy!",0
"This product make lashes look longer and thicker than any I've tried--and I've tested about all of them! This is the only mascara that makes you look as if you're wearing false eyelashes, yet it does NOT clump--except when the tube is nearly empty (& dry).
It's a deep, rich black that doesn't give you raccoon eyes as time passes, yet it lacks the chemicals that make ""waterproof"" mascara irritate sensitive eyes. My long-time favorite WAS Clinique High Impact. Because the Lorac brush is so thick (one reason it works so well) I started using the Lorac on my top lashes and the Clinique (more slender brush) on bottom lashes. Still, Lorac is great for entire eye; I just have problems (cringe) when a mascara brush--or anything--is near my eyes! BTW, both brands are a bit expensive, but the Lorac lasts much longer :.52 oz. vs. .28 oz. Finally, I can only find Lorac PRO at Kohl's and on Amazon...",1
this mascara is weird. it encapsulates your lashes. my lashes looked very sparse and separated. It was strange. It started to flake after a few hours. then it was hard to remove off of the ones that didn't flake.,0
Gift.,1
"This eye cream when I apply close to my eyes causes my eyes to tear !!!!!
It does nothing for my skin eye area.",0
It didn't really cover up mine was to watery but the shipping was pretty fast,0
"I would have given this product 5 stars because it really is a great product.  It does what it say it can do and it really does handle the toughest of tangles!

The reason I gave it 2 stars is that when I bought Unite in July it was $19.99 a fair price but when I went to order it today Sept 30, 20`7 ti was a whopping $28.00!  you can check it on other sites including Walmart who has it for $16.99 (I will order there once I finish this review ) a very good price.

Why and how can you justify raising your price to a ridicules price of $28.00?  You just lost a sale and a customer who would have been a customer for life!",0
Little more orange/peachy than I expected but still a nice color,1
"I have used this product for over a year.  Since I am super self conscious about my neck aging, while my facial lines are at a minimum for nearly 70, I had to try this product that I bought originally at Costco.  My best comment came from my husband, unsolicited, ""your neck really looks better"".  Enough said.",1
Did the formula change on this? Been using it for years. I obv love it. Got this new bottle and it stinks of chemicals to high heaven. Yuk! It's also way stickier now too. Making my hair crispy. Ew!,0
This product works like magic ! you notice the effect once you wake up in the morning and love the way your skin looks! Since day 1 .,1
"Bought two of these and there was no lip gloss in it, they were both dried out.  I wanted to return it but was not able to because the time was up even tho I just bought it a month ago.  I've bought these from Jane Iredale before and they were awesome.",0
"It's a bit pricey but well worth it.  It goes on like, well, Butter.  If you like nail polish I promise you will fall in love.  The color selection is unbelievable.",1
I thought I would like the shampoo/conditioner of a hair serum I got a sample of...I don't. Super chemical smell. Not worth the $$$.,0
"I thought I had ordered a 12 ounce bottle..when the one I received was only 6 ounces..I checked again..I buy this product regularly..and was a little upset that I was charged the same price I had previously paid for the 12 oz bottle, and only received the 6. Not sure if the order was somehow changed..but the price was not! Buyer beware I guess! Ughhh",0
For me this product just did not work. My hair is noticeable thinning in the front due to hair loss from medications. When I applied it as directed all it did was make my scalp look filthy dirty. I sent it back for a refund.,0
Either this is not really CK1 lotion or it's old. It does not smell the way it's supposed to. The whole reason I bought it was for the smell. Don't buy from this vendor.,0
FDA is corrupt from inside out top to bottom. It's about money. Just because it is fda approved doesn't mean a thing,0
Great color!,1
"it is a big bottle. I've  been using this all over my body, not using any soap and do feel less irritable and itchy. I have used Cetaphil on my face for years now but don't feel that clean if I use it to wash all of me. Bioderma is a little bubbly but not much and gives me that clean all over feeling. I think it's going to take some weeks to get to the bottom of this bottle even washing all over with it.

I'll let you know if this isn't a good shower gel for me or if my face starts breaking out.",1
"Best for me...tried others  but found GrandeLash MD  has worked well for my particular complexion and needs.  Plan to stay with this product  until a new formula improves it, always will to try.",1
"This product was extremely effective, I love how it gives you a natural look.",1
"Its literally alcohol, for the money use Q-tip and own alcohol save yourself few bucks.",0
So I'm Hispanic and do a lot of bleaching to my hair. Lately my hair took on a lot of damage. I've hear of tony moly and decided he'll why not....I felt the difference my first try. Now for those of you with curly hair and like your curly hair this isn't for you. But for those of us who have curly but wear it straight.... you can air dry your hair after using this without putting in product and your hair will dry semi straight and with little to no frizze!!! Once you flat Orion your hair it feels like silk. I'm buying this product to the end of my days lol I've already got my mom and two sister to try it and they love it as well !!,1
My wife raves about this.,1
"I ordered white and it matches perfectly. So easy to use and it does what it claims. Have tried others on the market and they don't compare at all. I have silver hair and this is awesome. Love, love, love it.",1
"This gel is great for taking with me to the gym. The soaps there tend to be pretty blah as far as quality goes, so this has been a real improvement. I like the fact that it can serve as a body gel as well as a shampoo. That's one fewer item to carry in my gym bag. My skin feels great after using this gel, too. It rinses clean, and I don't feel any of the residue I sometimes get from shower gels. It might get to be a bit too much buying this for every shower, but the convenience of the two-in-one makes it worth it for taking with me on the go.",1
"Well, I really wanted to love this highlighter! I had done tons of research and wanted something to highlight my cheekbones and give me that ""of the moment luminosity"" that everyone is raving about. I saw this on my discount shopping site for $10 and thought I would try it! It finally arrived today and I am sad to say that is has fairly large bits of glitter in it and it seems far too clubhopper/disco inferno instead of just a sheer luminous shine. Too bad! I'll have to find a friend who has a younger daughter that likes glitter to the max and let her have it! In the meantime, my quest for the perfect highlighter continues...",0
"its a good thing all brushes fit on the SMART CLARISONIC, I thought this was the kind with the chip---NOT  it works anyway, i'll be more careful next time when ordering!!!",1
"I really like this hair dryer. It's not revolutionary or anything but I do feel like it dries my hair quickly and I just like the feel of it. After reading some of the reviews I thought it would blow my hair around like crazy but not the case. It is strong but won't blow you away (ha ha). I love that the hot does not get too hot despite what other reviews say. My last dryer would burn my hair and scalp but this one will not do that. It is a bit heavy but somehow I like the weight of it. I can't really pin point why I like this one so much but I look forward to using it. It feels professional or something. Again, nothing new or exciting but it feels like a good quality dryer. Let's hope it doesn't blow up my outlet!",1
"Works good, smells great!",1
Quick delivery. Product feels great on my skin at night,1
Didn't find a sharpener to be able to use it once the tip is gone.,0
"I have used Pur Minerals 4-in-1 pressed mineral makeup for years and love it. This last one I purchased is different, and not in a good way. The consistency is different. The powder goes everywhere when I use the same brush as usual. That has never been an issue with Pur Minerals. It's as though it is a cheap drugstore powder rather than the Pur Minerals I am used to using. One swipe with the brush, and powder is flying everywhere, and once applied, it has a dry, caked look on my skin. People who are familiar with this product know that this is not right. I don't know if Pur has changed their formula, but this one does not work for me.

Update: I went to a well known make-up store to see the Pur Minerals they are selling. The first one I sampled was the smooth, silky formula I have used all along. However, there also was a dry, powdery, messy one like the one I had recently purchased on Amazon. The difference is the old, fantastic formula has a brown label on the bottom of the compact, and the new, AWFUL formula has a black label. I'll be changing my makeup after all these years! Bad move, Pur Minerals!",0
"This stuff is amazing, I have tried everything and this is the only thing that took away my dark spots. Just make sure to put it on the spot you want to fade or it will bleach the entire area. You must be consistent as it takes time to see results. Already on my third bottle and use it every time I get a post pimple mark on my face. Love this stuff!",1
perfect,1
package is suck,1
"This product made my hair limp and uncurlable!  No matter how long I left the curling iron on my hair, it simply flopped with no body whatsoever.  Supremely disappointed!",0
"I have been using this powder for years.

The coverage is significant.  But you can adapt the coverage to your needs.  It is especially good at camoflaging red, iritated skin which is good as my skin is sensitive and I often have to touch-up after an exfoliation or treatment.  The 'Radiant' shade matches my skin so well it's astounding.  I am pale but have some slight yellow undertones.  I would recommend you try out the shades in person before you order online, your won't regret it.

You can find Jane Iredale cosmetics, especially the foundations at Dermatologist's offices which is where I discovered it years ago.

Please note it is a matte finish.

I'm mid forties with mostly dry, sensitive skin.",1
"i love this scent; i've been using it for years now. it's light and refreshing and perfect for both everyday use and formal occasions. it's not musky at all, so it's light on your senses. and the price is not bad at all for how much i love it.",1
"Such a wonderful way to truly enjoy a warm bath. I only used 1/2 of each miniature bottle so that I could enjoy the aromatherapy of each oil. My bathroom smells so nice afterwards, and so do I! My only complaint is that the price has skyrocketed $30 in the one month since I made my purchase. Update April 20: the price has returned to what I originally paid. Yeah!",1
"I expected to be wowed after reading other people's reviews. It's a good mascara but I prefer they're real by benefit. Love the wand, the product itself doesn't seem anything out of this world though lmao",1
I like the deodorant but there are some times when it will not last the whole day. I live in Florida and during the summer there were a couple days that I noticed that the deodorant would not last the whole day.,1
Very good for dry feet,1
"After reading an article about how makeup with SPF isn't sufficient sun protection for your face, I did extensive research on what brands of sunscreen work the best under makeup while providing high SPF coverage. I saw this had excellent reviews, and I have to say it lives up to the hype. This sunscreen feels light on the face and has a pleasant smell, and makeup sits on it wonderfully. I use moisturizer first, then this sunscreen, then my usual primer, waiting a few minutes between the application of each to let the product sink in to the face. I then use It Cosmetics CC+ cream as my foundation, and have seen no negative impact on how it looks over this sunscreen versus how it looks over just moisturizer and primer.",1
"I am not sure this product is authentic--or perhaps it is off.  The mousse is thick, sticky and does not spread evenly.  Historically, in my experience, it has been light and foamy with no stickiness.",0
These products are great but the downside is that the smell is quite odd! I put this on st night once in a while but the drying cream smells awful! Its no miracle product but it does its job!,1
Disappointed in this product. I used exactly as directed and to no avail. I saw absolutely no difference in tone. Don't waste the money!!!,0
"I am so mad, my package arrived, the higlighter did not even come with the little box, the sticker is all scratched up and oily and there is highly any pigment in it. I definitely want a refund",0
"I am pretty sure this straightener definitely had potential but I wouldn't know because it was defective when I got it. even tho it was supposed to be 'new' I received a well used straightener who's switch was stuck and not working. I used it once by holding the switch down just to know if I should consider purchasing again from a different site, however I wasn't able to get over the defects. Overall from what I did see it seemed like a pretty good straightener and shipped fast. Good buy, just be sure you know the condition of it!",0
"Very disappointed.  Applied as recommended for a couple of weeks.  No noticeable results were noted, and I was also slightly allergic to the product.  Discontinued use and will not purchase again.",0
Gave me a headache every time I used it. The chemicals seem really harsh. Do not think this product should even be sold to the public.,0
"I love most of Jack Black's products but I feel like this one is a miss for me.  They call it a lather but it hardly lathers at all.  For the price, I want superior protection which I feel it did not provide so it looks like I'm going back to gels.",0
Did not care for this product either. It felt like water with some kind of chemical. Left my hair dry.,0
I expected it to be bigger since it's expensive I was disappointed in the size but I love the smell.,0
"I read all the reviews on Amazon for this curling iron and was so excited to receive it.  However, as soon as I plugged it in I could tell something was off.  I couldn't tell if it was heated up all the way because it still felt warm... so I waited 5 more minutes and no change... in a lot of the reviews people said it only took 30 seconds to heat up!  Not mine... after 15 minutes on the highest heat setting, I could still touch the barrell.  So upset!  I got this curling iron to replace a bad quality Revlon brand one from the drugstore that barely curled my hair.  But with this iron, I don't see any difference.

I am positive that Hot Tools is a great brand, but I'm also convinced I got a knock-off.  I ordered from the lowest-priced seller, which happened to be ""Amazon.com.""  If I were to do it over again, I would ORDER FROM A SMALLER SELLER.  I was enticed by the free shipping, but I would pay shipping all over again just to get the real thing from a more legit seller.  Be careful who you buy this iron from, you could get a knock-off!!!!",0
"If you can afford it, try it! Leaves my hair and scalp clean and refreshed!",1
"I wanted to wait to see how this product performs, so here's my review after using it for over a month.  This dry hair shampoo is the worst! First off my hair gets really oily if I don't wash it every day, so I like to use dry shampoo to keep from constantly washing my hair. I've tried many different brands and the only one that has worked for me so far is the Klorane Dry Shampoo which is much cheaper than this Rahua brand.  I paid $35 for this crappy product.  The clay clumps up in your hair and the smell is so perfumey-- it's nauseating.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  In fact, I wish I could return it to get my money back... Ugh.  I hope this review helps others out there!",0
"Doesn't rub off, yet washed off easily with water & face cleanser.  Better than drug-store-brands, but not as good as Lancme.",1
I think this brush cleanser is good for small brushes that are used to apply powder make-up. I felt disappointed when it couldn't remove the foundation from my bigger brushes at all.,0
Too big for the toppik bottle...,0
makes applying tanning lotion so easy ! and no orange hands!,1
"Ok so it took me a few practice runs with this thing haha.  It is large, which I love, it really does give me bouncy volume and makes me feel like I'm in a hair commercial :)  The spinning is very string though and sometimes your hair gets caught, I have thick wavy hair and it works great at straightening it while it curls it.  It just takes practice, the first time I used it I was mad....just fyi, hang in there, give it a few tries.  It helps to blow dry your hair a little first though, like 80% of the way dry, then use your air brush, it works great that way in my experience!! Now I am loving it!!",1
Exacltly what I was looking for. Good quality and heats up very quickly.,1
"I was very disappointed with this Proraso Shaving Soap.  RIght out of the gate, feel free to chalk it up to operator error, but I've watched barbers for all my life swirling brushes in these soap containers and whipping out lathers to shave someone.  This soap was a very hard gel; it didn't even break down in the sink with hot water running on it.  I put a puddle of warm water on it to stir it up figuring I'd pull up a dollop of whipped-cream-like soap for our shaving test, and had to scrape.  I didn't like this product.  Might have been a compromised container, so don't blame them necessarily - if your experience was different, so much the better.",0
"It was not the same shade as the Committed lip color I purchased from the actual theBalm web site. Still a color that I would wear, just wasn't as pink. It is long-lasting but since I drink a lot of water throughout the day, I do have to reapply once after lunch.",1
"I ordered and even paid express shipping, after reading all the great reviews about this product. This curling iron is NOT heating up to it's potential, and so it does not create any kind of curls. It's SO frustrating. My hair is fine and easy to curl, but this iron is such bad quality that it can't even curl a small strand of hair. It's design isn't any better. My hand/arm hurt at the end of every ""curl attempt"". It is super HEAVY. Don't waste your time and money with this. If I were you I'd go to Ulta and actually try out a curling iron before buying then you at least know what you're getting for the money. Bad investment.",0
excellent for your hair,1
The only cologne I use since I am hyper sensitive to strong scents. This is mild and lasts long enough for me. Smells great too. I have been using this brand for about 8 years now and not ready to change.,1
"I am from India and I know the different varieties of jasmines. But this product it's horrible, why they put the name jasmine to this product. Instead of this you can buy Mogra from pathanjali soaps. Before using korres, I used Mogra soap. It's real jasmine flavored body soap and after bath also I can feel the smell from my body. If you buy korres you forget the smell and quality. It's not refreshing body soap. Forget jasmine.....!",0
"didn't last any better than regular polish. won't purchase again. not a good value, this product is made in Mexico. I did not realize that before I purchased it",0
Its too expensive. I found the same item somewhere else for a better price and for more.,0
"I don't particularly care for the smell and I need to use quite a bit or else it does nothing to help detangle; due to that it leaves a lot of buildup.
It might be good for shorter hair, but I won't be purchasing it again nor would I recommend it.",0
"More expensive than regular hair blow dryer, but it will last a long time and won't burn your hair. Great service when you have a problem with your hair dryer when it's under warranty. Simply send it to them, they would fix it and return it to you promptly.",1
Plastic overwrap on package was open on one end and yellowish in color. Writing was in another language. Fragrance is very faint and wears off very quickly. Learned my lesson about purchasing fragrances on line.,0
Both my kids had horrible allergic reactions to this lotion. Head to toe itchy hives! I would not recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.,0
Should have read the reviews before I purchased this. Apparently I'm not the only one who thinks it smells like nothing. It's like someone took the empty bottles and refilled them with water and a bit of alcohol. What a waste of money. I thought that was illegal..?,0
Love the way it goes on,1
This is super flimsy. I liked the concept but in practice its not sturdy enough and too small to work securely with. I used this for a couple weeks before buying an eyelash curler from Tarte.,0
I have used this for 15 weeks and cannot tell any difference in my neck. I am 68 years old so it may help younger skin.,0
"I have used these three times. So far, I have noticed that it makes my skin brighter and smoother. I have very sensitive skin, so that in itself is pretty impressive. I am 47 and have fine lines pretty much everywhere! Haven't noticed a reduction of wrinkles, but I'll finish out the tubes and see what happens.",1
"Sorry not the right colo, it looked like sand, ok for summer, just wanted to add, plums the world is the closest can find for the original color, just a tad darker. Good luck till opi gives us back my favorite color!",0
This came sooner than expected and I love that! It was very well packaged and intact. It smells just like the one my salon uses and makes my hair feels amazing!,1
I was very happy to see this product at a much cheaper price especially after spending 60 dollars at sephora.. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed with this purchase ..the capsules were broken and the glass bottle had this dried brown stuff all over  .. From now on I'll stick to purchasing things like this at retail price so that I don't end up with such a horrible item .. You should really inspect your products before sending them out .. The price is half the retail price but that is not an excuse to send people garbage ..I shop online all the time and this has never happened to me ..,0
I felt a big difference on my face after just a few days of use.,1
"I received the wrong scent and Amazon was not able to replace it with the correct one.  I was a bit disappointed since I wanted the product, but the customer service was fantastic on the return!  They refunded my purchase price before I even sent the product back and they made the return very easy!!  Thanks for the great service!!

The 4 stars are because I have this product that I purchased at a local store and I really like it.  It is a bit expensive for what you get hence the 1 star deduction, but overall I really like this product!",1
Was totally broken,0
I color my hair and wash and blowdry everyday. This stuff dies not way my hair down bug conditions my hair well. This bottle good price on amazon last a long time. The smell is clean and not overpowering,1
Product was in the smallest container and not worth wasting money on!,0
It gave me some rashes on my face not good for sensitive skin.,0
"This shower oil may sound a little strange. I have used some products marketed as such which just left a greasy residue on my skin. This is a little different because it emulsifies when it comes in contact with water and gets sort of creamy. After applying and adding I thought this was a nice moisturizing product that restored moisture to the skin's surface and left my skin with a soft glowing patina that looked far nicer than dry skin with a crocodile look that resembled one of my handbags.
This product has a nice scent which isn't too much and it left my skin feeling better after a day at the beach. I have used another product that works in similar fashion that is less expensive, yet this is also equally nice.
My only advice is that the shower got a little slippery when in use so a rubber bath mat might be needed.",1
It does not stay put.,0
I AM ALLERGIC TO THE PRODUCT AND THE STUFF WAS WHITE AND THE PICS WAS DARKER COLOR.,0
"doesn't last long and not worth the money. If you have very thinning hair, try something else. You would have to pour a bucket of this on your hair if you want results and you'll just be wasting your money because it will look fake and gone within hours due to sweat and humidity.",0
"For the price and name, I expected better. The powder is not soft at all, and doesn't go on smoothly.
I would not recommend this product",0
Save your money....not worth it.,0
"Maybe I'm just an anomaly, but this didn't work for me at all. I have very dry skin and maybe this wasn't meant for people with dry skin; I wish it would have indicated that somewhere before I bought it. I put it on after I showered and my face felt really tight and dry after applying it. So I applied a second coating of it and my face still felt really dry. Also, it neither smells good nor bad. It smells like plant; I assume it's probably the smell of aloe since it contains aloe.",0
"the Zoya brand is excellent polish, stays on without chipping much longer than any other nail polish I have used AND it is non-toxic which I love!

The color locking system works quite well as does the polish remover--does not require a lot of scrubbing like some of the other removers.",1
"This is by far the best shampoo I've used. I've been buying the small sizes (the ones that came in a kit with the conditioner). I've bought this big one, looks like it will last longer. Leaves my hair very smooth and shiny as well.",1
"Cooling, soothing cream.  Nice scent and great quality.  Just a little bit applied with a badger brush gives a great shave.",1
good product,1
SO FREAKING PRETTY,1
"Butter London is a very nice polish. Two coats plus a top coat produces beautiful streak-free coverage, and it dries quite quickly.

I bought the color ""Fiver"" expecting mint green, but it's much closer to robin's egg blue. Not very minty at all. I still love the color, but I'm going to have to keep searching for that perfect pale mint green.",1
Too sticky -- Makes my hair hard to brush and pulls hair out instead of helping.,0
"This is an easy-to-apply concealer, and the color matches my skin tone. My issue is under-eye dark circles. Nothing completely gets rid of them -- I've tried other concealers -- but this does a decent job for me. (I'm in my 60s, so I don't expect any product to give me back the skin I had in my 20s.) I use my finger to put it on, blend it in, then set it by powdering my face. You could also use a small makeup brush to apply it. It's in a lipstick-type tube instead of a bottle with a brush like the other concealers I've used. When the weather is hot -- which it often is in South Texas -- I apply it in the morning and then again in the afternoon or evening if I'm going to be out and about. It has no fragrance. It's not the cheapest product on the market, but it gets the job done.",1
This bottle of water in my life is a good helper.,1
"A little goes a long way. This give my fine, limp, thin hair volume that lasts almost all day. Purchased about a year ago....still have about 1/2 a bottle left. I have found that if I don't use the same styling product daily I have better results with volume from products. I will prchase this again when I near the end of the bottle.",1
"I was really excited and hopping this product would work for me. But instead, I got realy bad allergic reaction from it. My face becomes red, sore, ichy and scaly. It's getting worse day by day. Definitely not recommend.",0
Ordered and it arrived so quickly. It allows your hair to feel softer.,1
"Totally matte, which I love! Feels light on my face.l",1
This item is even too HOT to use on lowest setting.  It burns the hair and your head and hands.  Consider it a safety issue.  Would not recommend it for purchase.,0
Not organic,0
Great matte texture. Not easy to blend.,1
I have used this conditioning treatment before and enjoyed it .But this batch seems to be a little watered down,0
A shade just lighter than Opi's Ballet Slippers. It's very sheer and makes your nails look beautiful and elegant.,1
"I like this brand, stays a bit longer than regular polish.",1
"I found this product did absolutely NOTHING for me...granted I don't have huge wrinkles, but the few I do have certainly got no better and i'm wondering if it made them worse! I wish I had asked around from friends, cause if I had I would have discovered this on my own without wasting the money. I'm wondering a couple of things, what all the fuss is about with strivectin? Is it just that everyone is different and some people have good results and some don't? AND is there anyone out there who can recommend a product that REALLY works? (if it works i don't mind spending the money...)",0
Great,1
This topcoat allows my nail polish to last far longer than I expect!! It is perfect and I'll buy it from here on out.,1
It worked well.....but it broke on me 6 months after I bought it.,0
"This lotion is very hydrating but most pregnant women have a heightened sense of smell, and not sure why the makers of this prenatal lotion was not sensitive to that.  The fragrance in this lotion is just too much.",0
After using allergy,0
"This is wonderful moisturizer. It goes on silky clean without greasiness or stickiness. The scent is delightful. Very invigorating but not harshly minty. I really love it and always have it on hand. What would give it five stars? It comes in a metal container, which is fine, but the last couple of inches just will not pump out (and this lotion isn't cheap). So, I end up turning the container upside down so that the last of it is in the top. When I unscrew the top a big glob of lotion shoots out on me....which is ok, or on the floor, which isn't. That said I like it too much to let that bother me for long.",1
"My go to self-tanner. Leaves you beautifully bronze after one application. Dries in a minute or two and then you're good to get dressed! Sometimes a little color comes off on light clothing, but everything comes out in the wash. totally worth it for the natural looking color. Only ranking 4 is cause it will stain your palms unless you wash SECONDS after application or you buy the gangly, awkward mit.",1
So light that it is almost useless for someone with moderately dry skin.,0
"I've been using this for a couple years now. Won't go a day without it, it really works! Yes it's a little expensive, but one drop will do both eyes, so it lasts.",1
"Does add length to eyelashes, but is very sticky and makes my eyelashes clump. I already have pretty long eyelashes -- was looking for something that made them look more full. This is not it. Wouldn't recommend.",0
"just okay, I prefer standard brushes without the hard nubs in it.",0
"this stuff is truly the very best moisturizer I have ever tried.  I'm 61, I have always had dry skin.  I starting using this not only on my face, but my arms and legs.  AMAZING!!!!",1
Great product!,1
"I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

Over all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.",1
does not last a week and color is very light..needed 3 coats,0
I am a nurse living in the Houston area and work with patients in a hospital where I consistently wash my hands or use hand sanitizer throughout the day which ends up leaving my skin very dry. I used L'Occitane products for face and body moisturizers so I am familiar with the quality that this company brings to the table. The Shea Butter hand cream was a first time try and I LOVE it! But that doesnt come as a surprise. It immediately leaves your skin soft and moist. You will have some left over residue and to some it may feel a bit oily but it then tends to just seep into your skin and smells great! The consistency of the cream is very thick so a little bit goes a long way. I bought this about a month ago and use it everyday and its still more than 3/4 the way full.,1
Don't expect a $200 dryer for $20 and you won't be disappointed. I got this and the GHD and there's no comparison. Not even close. Sorry.,0
"I spray this onto my face before I apply face masks, lotions, and serums. I love rose scented products and this scent, in particular, is light and refreshing. This isn't one of the ""must have"" products I use in my everyday skincare routine, but it's something fun I look forward to using. This would be a cute stocking stuffer idea, too!",1
I love the flat iron but I purchased my first one and within three months it stop working I thought it was the automatic shut off but it did not turn back on returned it got another one and it happen again so disappointed and I have been calling the number thats in the box no luck and I have emailed and no response !! Waste of money,0
Leaves a film on my hair.  Doesn't lather well.,0
horrible.. did not work at all,0
I love this toothpaste. I first discovered it while I was living in Italy and the basic Colgate toothpastes tasted strange to me. Back in the U.S. the only place I have been able to find this stuff is at Anthropologie. I ordered it on Amazon and love being able to use it back here at home. The Ginger mint flavor is my favorite- and I have also tried the extra whitening flavor- the tube lasts forever. Definitely worth the price!,1
Exactly as I expected,1
"I wanted to love this comb, I really did. I have thick curly 3a hair that is difficult to comb through and was so excited to see this. It is very large and heavy. The teeth are very thick. It is awkward to use and hurts if you accidentally tap your head. It did work to remove the knots, but didn't seem to work any better or faster than my regular wide tooth comb. I think this comb is really better for type 4 curls",0
"The reviews said this was a spray and it most definitely is NOT!  It's a liquid/cream that you pump.  It smells wonderful initially, but after a while, it's almost overwhelming.  It didn't give my short hair any texture.  It just made it flat!  I was so disappointed and it was very expensive!  Don't buy this if you're hoping for good texture and hold!",0
"I had used the Supersmile System in the past and stopped for a couple years because I was very happy with my teeth ( smart right). Needless to say I eventually noticed the difference and started with the toothpaste, accelerator, and toothbrush recently, I saw a difference immediately and even though you do not NEED to use this brush with it, there is just something comfortable about the shape and feel of this specific toothbrush. In my case it does not hold its shape long ( I'm a hard brusher) but I still love the way it fits and feels.",1
My lashes definitely grew in length and in volume! The only thing was it irritated my eyes if I applied too much or too often.,1
"If you want to cover imperfections or make your skin look like perfect, this is the PERFECT foundation to buy.  A little goes a long way.  Be sure to buy a blending brush or sponge.  I prefer a brush but highly recommend this product.  It covers sun/aging spots which is exactly what I needed.",1
This definitely adds volume. It's more like a dry shampoo than a texturizer that adds piece-iness.  I'll buy it again.,1
This was an opened package and I beleive it was a knock off. I have used presage prior bought from nordstroms and this does not seem the same. No longer using,0
"Wow, in case you don't know the size of a 0.11 container, visualize a thimble.  A small thimble.",0
"This mascara is AMAZING! Highly recommend for short, stubborn eyelashes!",1
"This conditioner moisturizes and softens like no other.  I also love the smell.  What's even better is that you don't have to use a ton of the product, which is a good thing since it's not cheap.  I apply it mainly to my ends and little at the crown. With other brands, the softness usually doesn't last, especially after styling.  But it's not the case with this conditioner.  It's a definite hair care must-have.",1
I received the shampoo and the top was broken while still wrapped in bubble wrap.,0
"Is not the quality I selected to be for the price,it dries up and doesnt stay in skin,poor quality,is old",0
Greatas a  hand cream.,1
Great. Give nice curl,1
This product completely stopped working less than 6 months after purchase.,0
"I really wanted to like this but it's just too heavy. Once on, it feels like a thick foundation and gives me that waxy look and makes my pores look bigger than they are. I was pleasantly surprised by the color though - like others have said, it's not as dark as it looks once you put it on.",0
"Oh my goodness the smell!!!! I'm very disappointed with this product. I love their purifying shampoo, it saved my scalp, so I thought I would try out this conditioner to go with it. It is pretty darn expensive, but so is the shampoo and it is worth every cent so I thought why not. Unfortunately I've only been able to use it once because the smell made me so sick to my stomach. I can't put my finger on it, because it isn't that it is a ""gross"" smell or anything it just literally makes me feel sick to my stomach. It took almost two days for the smell to go away enough to not bother me. Overall the product seemed to work well left my hair nice and moisturized, but I'm not able to get over the smell and how sick it make me feel.",0
"I love this toothpaste. It is fantastic. The taste is like mint with a hint of jasmin. Totally refreshing. The packaging is cute, with the same colors as shown. It arrived perfectly fine, no damages in box.",1
BEST GEL EVER,1
I was hoping this shampoo would help with the yellowing in my hair caused by our well water. It didn't but worked okay as just a regular shampoo.,0
great!,1
lovely authentic.,1
"very very nice, good smell, nice texture, BUT BUT BUT the price! too high! why?",1
"I changed from Baxter of California to MenScience, but the MenScience smells like mildew.  While this is a step up from Baxter, which smelled like a urinal, I'm thinking male AHA and BHA products may just be a waste of money.",0

thanks,1
"Beautiful color but my nail polish is probably old. It was very chunky and dried super quickly. Once it was applied, it was patchy so I decided to add another layer. Bad idea. No matter how long I waited for it to dry and used my top coat it just peeled right off.",0
"Works as advertised. Wrinkled  skin under my arm pits are now smooth and supple. Would have given it a 5 star rating, but the smell was not to my liking. Great price, will buy again to keep the wrinkles away. Almost forgot, the skin above my knees are improving, you will know what I am talking about if you are over 50!",1
I should have questioned if it was real considering the price. It barely smells like anything and is no way the real thing. I can't return it either.,0
Not that great. It is like any average soap but cost 10 times as much.,0
like it,1
Great product,1
"A long time ago I had a little aerosol spray of purified water next to my desk. It was intended as a refresher, and also helped with dry eyes (I wore contacts back then). It was nice. Every so often, I would use it and it was kind of like taking a little break. I haven't seen those around in a long time, but this looked kind of like it, so I decided to try it out.

It is pump, not aerosol, which is fine. In fact, maybe more than fine, as the aerosol cans never seem to hold as much as the pump versions, so perhaps it will last longer that way.

I was a bit skeptical. Okay, more than a bit. The claims like oxygenation of your skin, the fact that it contains vitamin C, but you don't ingest it, all seems a bit hokey to me. However, I gave it a fair shot and sprayed it on my face (with my eyes closed, as they recommend), and it was nice. Refreshing, like my old plain water spray, but also has a nice light natural scent that reminds me of licorice and bananas. Nothing strong - this isn't perfume by any means. Just enough scent to be pleasant. I also found that my skin felt softer afterward. I'm really not sure why, but it was true.

Overall, I like this. It is kind of like a little portable pick-me-up that would be great after coming inside from the heat, or just to break up a long day. I took off a star because it is crazy overpriced. The profit margins on this thing must be stunning. However, it does the job, and I enjoyed it.

"Had to through away this product. Was lumpy must of been old, and not worth returning. Very disappointed since I have ordered from this company and have been satisfied in the past.",0
"This used to be my go-to foundation because it was easy to apply, felt good (high quality), and the color looked great with my skin tone.  Then we had some other expenses so I decided to try some of the cheaper options found on the ""top drugstore products"" lists.  After a few of those, none of them were as nice as LG, so I was excited to go back. HOWEVER, they've changed it--THE QUALITY OF THE MAKE UP IS NOT AS NICE.  It feels cheaper, doesn't go on as well. So disappointing!!  I'll be trying a different higher end brand!",0
"You'll need to scrape at the shellac still, but works pretty well and easy to scrape off. Doesn't dry your nails out.",1
"I bought four bottles. Three of the pumps were broken. Not that big of a deal, I know, but when pay so much for ahampoo and conditioner the pumps should work.",0
This product seems to make application of makeup evenly easier. I would purchase again.,1
"I love this product! Its amazing how well it works. I usually let my nails dry for several minutes before using this but it does work if you wait just a minute or two. It also smells really nice. The bottle will last a very long time too, since you only use one drop per nail.",1
"This is the bst product I have found for hiding my hyperpigmentation.  There is no odor, it's not oily, it feels very light, I hardly notice I have it on and it lasts all day!",1
"I have tons of skin device at home. This little device is too strong for in home use.  I bought this in the hope of reducing the lines and darkcircle underneather the eyes. When I use the device near the eye area, it feels like having rubber band shooting the eye area. I can normally tolerate the pain but this is just too much pain around the eyes. I tried two days in a roll. At first my under eye areas are red and then the next day It fade away. However, my eye area gets even more wrinkely than ever plus I got this little brown spot around the eyes. As a result, I stopped using it.",0
"This was a disappointment. I heard such great things on the internet about this guy and it just fell way short of my expectations. The cloth is just too long to get up close to your eye makeup (even on the short side) so I need to go over my eye area with makeup remover after using the makeup eraser. Also, it is stained with liner and mascara and did not wash out in the washing machine.",0
Lovely soft floral scent. The bottle is made of very thick glass and is VERY heavy. It does not feel nice in the hand. It may be too heavy and cumbersome for someone with moderate arthritis.,1
"I love La Roche Posey products, but this just doesn't meet my expectations. First of all, it burns really bad, but also causes me to breakout and I haven't had breakouts in years. I do not have sensitive skin and am used to glycolic acid peels, but for some reason I am sensitive to something in this formula. This is a hard pass for me.",0
"I first tried the Suave Professionals Dry Shampoo, as it claimed to be just as good as Rene Furterer. I was impressed, but I always wanted to try the original. Well, when I studied abroad in Paris this past fall, I realized how much I missed my dry shampoo. My hair becomes VERY oily at the roots two days after showering, and with natural blonde hair, it shows! I was excited when I found this product - the 3.2 oz size - at a pharmacy just a ten minute walk away from home! The smell alone is SO much better than the Suave product, and the original kept my hair looking oil-free the second day until I took my next shower with just ONE application, unlike the Suave. I also never had a problem with the product running out too fast (hint: make sure it isn't leaking gas from the nozzle after use! If it is, just make sure to press down on the nozzle firmly when you use it. I find that, with aerosols, the resulting pressure difference helps cut the flow completely once you release your finger).

The product itself deserves 5 stars. But, I have to take a star away for the outrageous price. I understand it has to be imported from France, which makes the price higher than I knew in Paris. But $8 for the 1.6 oz bottle, and $21 for the 3.2??? I'm sorry, I spent MAX 7 EUR on the 3.2 oz bottle (about $9), and even stumbled upon a 2 for 10 EUR pack at a different pharmacy.

If you have the money, I suggest trying the 1.6 oz size. If you try it and love it like I did, I'd suggest searching elsewhere for a better price for a 3.2 oz bottle: shoot for around $15.",1
Very good product!,1
"It doesn't seem to give my hair texture or lift, and it makes it look a little dirty or greasy.",0
"Light feel with good coverage.  I apply and blend with my ring finger under my eyes and it immediately brightens my face.  Can't say I notice any age-repairing effects, but I don't care.  Really like the texture and the nature look once applied.",1
"So disappointed in L'Occitane. We happily used this soap for years and loved it, until the new refills arrives. They've changed the formula, not just the packaging. The soap is now purple (for one thing), and the #2 ingredient is SLES (Sodium Laureth Sulfate), and it has PEG-40. So sad they've cheaped out. All done with their products, not to mention they've gotten really expensive too. If you, like many people, are looking to reduce your chemical load in health and beauty products by buying cleaner products, find something else, not this.",0
"I don't know what these other people are talking about. I have had this dryer for almost two years, it is the best. I have gone through many, many other units and they pale next to the Farouk. It will dry your hair perfectly without frying it. Total top shelf!!!!",1
"This didn't work as well as I thought it would.  I cut myself a lot which almost never happens with the ""generic"" Barbasol shaving cream I normally use yet I still had hair in a few places that for some reason the razor didn't quite pick up.  It took much longer than necessary to apply the cream and I realized after 3 uses this just wasn't for me.  The cream residue also builds up in the sink and can clog the drain much easier than the regular shaving cream.",0
"My wife this year was in love when she opened her gifts,. She loves this stuff. I don't really know why. But, a man just doesn't question a woman's desires. :)",1
I love this because it makes my nails work really glassy and girly.  It makes your nails shiny and slightly (really really slightly) pinkish.  ALSO strengthens your nails.  Can't go wrong!,1
"It leaves my hair dry and thirsty for moisture, but it has a very nice smell.",1
This is a good concept but the file needs to be a bit smoother.  It rips my nails instead of filing them.  Too rough.,0
Been hooked on this from a cruise a few years ago! My skin never looked better! Worth the$$!  I get more compliments about my skin than I ever have,1
"I much prefer eye-lining pencils over all the powders and ""paint on"" varieties that have come out in recent years.  Call me old fashioned.  If you're like me, and have owned a few dozen different brands over the decades, then you'll understand the frustration of finding a great liner, only to have the wood shaft of the pencil splinter when you sharpen it.  Cheap wood - the bane of pencils of all varieties.

When I opened the cap on this liner I was delighted to see a very tight grained light colored wood.  I itched to sharpen it right away.  I used a basic sharpener and can't tell you the happiness I felt to shave the thinnest curls of wood off the pencil.  This is made possible by the tight grain of the premium wood they encased this lovely liner inside - not by an extraordinary blade.

And the liner?  Shade 01 is the deepest pitch black I've seen in a very long time.  The pigment is super saturated so your lines are consistent from beginning to end.  It goes on very smoothly and it resists smudging and moisture for hours.  It comes off when you take it off. With sharpening you can create a super fine tip for the thinnest lines, or you can use it the way it comes for a medium width line.  The color is even and lasts all day without problem.

I'm addicted and buying the other color too.  I love it.

Added Jan 24, 2015:

So I bought color #2 not really knowing what color to expect.  I wasn't sure from the pictures if it was brown or a shade of grey.  It is definitely not brown.  It's a dark grey or a lighter black than #1.  The quality is just as good and the grain is just as tight on the wood.  #2 is a better shade for my fair complexion.  I continue to be impressed by the long-wearing quality of this eyeliner.",1
"The first time I used it was great.  I am not sure if it was the tempature or what happened but it did burn my hair. I freaked out.  If you want it hot, this sure did it!.  The ease of the whole product did work good.  I was looking for a product to keep my curl.",0
"Pros:
-Some fancy European toothpaste that you can use to impress your S.O
-Interesting design to add some class to your bathroom
-Fresh smelling breath

Cons:
-Small tube (25ml)",1
I like it!,1
Overpriced with average results,0
I didn't really care for this as a concealer but I really like it for contouring. You do have to use a setting powder with it if you want it to last more than a few hours but it really does work well as I use a setting powder anyway. It goes on easy and blends easy as well. If you're looking for a concealer that offers VERY light coverage this is a good choice. If you're looking for an extra contouring tool this is great.,1
I was hoping for a darker shade,1
Amazing product. My 20 month old daughters lips we're always dry even though I used Burt's bees. Justine application of this made her lips soft. I also apply this on her cheeks.,1
"This moisturizes lightly so it's good for fine hair. As another review mentioned, it doesn't soften the hair, just relieves dryness. In the winters, especially, that's what I need.",1
"I have dark skin so hyperpigmentation on my face has always been a problem. It's pretty terrible... And by terrible I mean, strangers on the street give me advice on my face because it's seriously that bad!  I used this stuff every night before bed for a month, all over my face,  and I've seen insane results! A lot of my stubborn dark marks on my cheeks have faded, I'm assuming in another month or less they'll be gone! The lighter spots on my forehead and cheeks have disappeared completely! I've recommended this to so many friends with the same problem. Try it but be consistent! I read some other reviews stating it was too harsh on their skin.  My advice would be take it down a notch, apply maybe every other night or in problems areas only, whatever works for your skin  best,  but remember to do it consistently! You'll see results :) I'm wondering if I can somehow post a before and after picture of my face in a review?",1
"I like this ok but it does not remove my mascara.  It moves it, to the bottom of my eyes!  To be fair nothing takes it off except eye make up remover which bothers my eyes.  ( it's not waterproof either). But I like this cleanser as it isn't drying, rinses well and keeps my skin soft.  Strong smell but I like it.",1
Love this stuff! So light and doesn't weigh your hair down! Just be careful not to spray so much or else it will get a bit sticky. Smells great!,1
I've been using this for months and I see no improvement in my soft peeling nails.,0
"I first tried this serum when I got a 0.5 ounce bottle in the amazing Pret-a-Porter beauty variety kit. Out of all the items included, this and Charlotte Tilburys Magic Cream stood out and I used up both. And, despite the price tags, I bought the full sizes of each. I had never known of either of them before those deluxe samples.

What I first loved about the serum was how good it felt to use. It smells fresh and green with a floral note, which I absolutely adore. Of course some people may not like a heavy fragrance in their skincare or may be sensitive to it, so Im also highlighting it as A potential negative. The fragrance lasts awhile, too, but, as I said, personally I like it. Its not the classic Jurlique rose scent, but its very pretty.

The serum is a nice consistency that is not too slippery, but glides over your skin with ease. Its cool and pleasant, and doesnt leave a stiff or sticky residue.

I find that its really easy to add a product to your skincare routine when you love using it. It becomes an anticipated ritual, soothing and relaxing, that helps you keep using it frequently enough and long enough to see real results. The small bottle lasted a very long time, even with my generous use. Its supposed to be about a months worth, and Id say I got 7 weeks out of it. I think, for that and its efficacy, this is a good value, though it is an investment.

I am 36 so my skincare needs are evolving. I have found that, whole in conjunction with the Magic Cream, did the following:

- made my skin more supple
- visibly smoothed my t-zone
- decreased some mild redness on either side of my nose
- gave my skin a more even appearance

I don't have a lot of experience with serums. My previous retexturizing serum was by Chanel, and before that I used the purifying Chanel Purete Id&eacute;al serum for my 20s, when I had more need of oil control. Im a big fan of skincare products, and I try new ones all the time. I know thats not the best way to get results, but as I said above, I have to really like using it as well as see results. Im about halfway through this bottle, and I don't know if Ill buy another. It depends on the budget when I run out. But I will always have this on my top ten list!

In addition to this, my skincare routine currently includes:
Philosophy Purity Facewash
Fresh Rose Toner
Chanel Calming Emulsion
Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream

So that combination may have contributed to the results. Since I wasn't using this serum alone, I cant be sure. I would recommend all of the above!",1
Good product.,1
"On my third bottle of this gel.  It seemed great at first, good volume, goes on clean etc. But the last bottle I got of it seems a bit sour.  Whereas I loved the aroma of this stuff at first, it now strikes me like they just didn't get the mixture right.  Not sure if it's a bad batch or a change to the entire product.

I will say that the Jack Black hand creme is an excellent product to which I am deeply committed.  You can't go wrong there.  As for this hair gel, I'm going back to Khiel's.",0
"I love LAFCO products. They all smell wonderful and my skin feels great. The low rating for this product comes from the fact that the pump spout was broken off and when delivered , the soap was spilled  in box so I lost about an ounce. The LAFCO lotion came separately and was well packaged.",0
"My wife's review: I cant yet say that this product is the ""fountain of youth"" that LOccitane suggests it is, but what I can say is the oil feels great on my face. A little of this product goes a long way, which is a good thing because it's pricey. You don't need to apply much. I use it overnight, and the oil is absorbed by the skin with no grease residue. I have combination skin: different areas of my face are oily and dry. Using the product in the areas of my neck and around the eyes feels soothing, and maybe in time by continually feeding the skin with this product, I will see a youthful change in my overall skin tone. So far, after two weeks, that hasn't happened, but this oil would be a great alternative to a night crme.",1
The product was broken,0
It does nothing actually I'm upset with it whenever I use it in the 3d day the hair grow up again.. Only losing money for no result.. They say u get the same clinic Laser results but that's totally untrue cuz I've tried the clinic and it least with me one month before the hair grow up agin,0
"I love this product from Stila and have purchased in the past through a reputable beauty supplier like Sephora or Ulta with no issues, so figured I would add to another Amazon order to save me a trip to the store.  The color I ordered was moss (dark green) and it arrived quickly.  I was excited to try so applied right away and instantly my eyelids were sticky.  It transferred to my upper eye lid and was goopy and irritating to my eyes.  I figured after a long day, my other eye makeup was the issue.  The next day I tried again and had the exact same issue with it not staying in place, transferring to my eyelid - so bad that my eyes would actually ""stick"" open.  I tried several times to wipe it off and clean up the line on my lid, but eventually had to remove with make up remover and apply a different liner.  This product was NOT Stila.  It looks authentic, but there's no way unless it's old/expired.  Very disappointed and no return option.",0
I used to LOVE this stuff but something has changed in the formula and colors. It was VERY THIN and did not leave a lasting stain color. Bummer,0
"CHEAPY MADE.  I loved this BUT if you're going to buy it, realize that it's very cheaply made and may only last you a few months. I loved the idea of a small and flat curler and, for a while, this was great! Curling my eyelashes is something I do daily so I consider it a necessity and I'm willing to pay for a good one. For the price, getting only a few months of use doesn't seem like a value so I'll replace it with a different brand.",0
"I've been wearing this perfume for over a year, always bought it at Macy's but decided to buy it online this time for convenience. This perfume did not have the same scent or last as the original I have always bought.",0
Excellent,1
"This is very moisturizing!  As a nurse, I have my hands in water all day and they can get very torn-up, especially in winter.  The ""seaside"" scent is very relaxing and brings me back to center when my day is spinning out of control. It is noticeable, so if that bothers you, it might not be the best choice for you.  Sounds cliche that smelling a nice fragrance can help one relax, but little things like that, for me, can make a difference.  I like this as much as I like Dr. Hunter's Rosewater & Glycerine Hand Creme.  The ingredient list on that one is a bit more appealing to me, but it's nice to change things up.  I think this is a nice low-priced ""little luxury"" item to give or keep for yourself.",1
Its a pleasant product to use it. It keeps my hair shining and smooth and it got a nice scent.,1
"Love this! Leaves my normally coarse, frizzy hair shiny and curly with minimal frizz.",1
This product serves its purpose well.,1
"The color on the end..  pink.. is my favorite.  As I use this, the brown overcomes the entire product..  and therefore I waste half of this.  It is clearly a design flaw.  When in 4 quadrants did not deal w this.  Make all 4 colors equal all the way through. Please.",0
"This is so gentle for my skin, I'm 38 and pregnant, I was looking for something natural because you cant trust anything on the market these days and the chemicals are overwhelming. This cleans my skin, I have combination and feel so good, it doesnt leave a residue. I highly recommend this",1
"GOOD DEAL,FAST SHIPPING",1
"I probably won't buy this product again. It provides good coverage but every time I happen to scratch my head, I end up with brown powder under my nails & it's kind of gross & a little embarrassing - ew! But if you need a super quick fix, it works.",0
I ordered 6 and at least half of them was old. Meaning that the procuct had gone bad and become as hard as a rock.,0
"I got the Aria which is a strong, purplish berry color. It's too much for anyone but those with dark skin, and I have fair skin so I hate it. Even using a light frosted lipgloss over it wasn't even to tone it down.

I found the lipstick itself to be soft and sort of creamy with good staining ability.

I'm not sure you can't find this same clownish color in the drugstore for half the price.",0
MY HOLYGRAIL EYELINER IS HEREEEEEE,1
"I live in Louisiana and my hair frizzes.  I previously bought some ""air wax"" to put on the ends.  My hair is oily and fine, so most products leave it greasy.  Maybe I don't know how to use this product, but it doesn't help the frizz & certainly doesn't add volume.",0
"This stuff is good, and helping fix my nails after going on a gel polish bended for the past 6+ months.. the only thing that worries me is that IT CONTAINS FORMALDEHYDE.  That can't be good for a person.",1
Thought I was buying tommy bahama st barts set sail. This seems to be another product very weak and rubbing alcohol smelling.  .Appears to be made by another company licensed to sell under the TB name.,0
I've been using this product for years!!!!!  and hope to continue to use it. It's hard to find locally.  Thanks for asking.,1
"This product looks, smells and feels just like sunscreen.  It isn't moisturizer and doesn't effect dry skin.  It may help with sun exposure but save your money and use regular sunscreen, don't buy this if you're looking for a good face moisturizer",0
"Why the price increase on this line? The smaller bottle size was one thing, but the price increase really? Time to switch. I recommend La Rouch Pousay or Cetaphil",0
great for your hair and skin!,1
"pump bottle stopped working and the soap would leak around the base. sad . great soap, great smell",0
"I actually really like the hairspray, what I am VERY UNHAPPY about is the following:
The last order I placed arrived without lids.  Really?  The hairspray had sprayed out of one of the cans and was already partially empty.  Also, I need the lids to keep the sprayer from getting clogged, and for travel.

Also, about every 1 in 3 cans I order seems to be faulty in the spraying mechanism.  I have to vigorously shake the can up and down WHILE spraying to get any hairspray to come out.  This has been a big issue.  I have wasted approximately 3 cans thus far on that problem.  I was giving R+Co one more chance because I really do like the products.... but after getting my last order, not gonna happen.",0
"This product has alcohol in it and that drys out your hair.  I like to use products with sulfate, and paraben free.  This doesn't have any of those ingredients but has alcohol.",0
The black coating on this curling iron chips off and ends up in your hair!,0
"Nice straightener!  It works really well just like the CHI I used to own.  It heats up really quick and does the job well.  The only problem I have with it is the on/off button and heat adjustment knob looks cheaply made.  It's more of an appearance thing, my CHI looked top to bottom like a product made with great material.  This one just appears to have more of a cheap plastic look to it, but just the button/knob part, the rest of it looks really good.  I guess I was just surprised, but for the price it does just as good as those expensive CHI straighteners.  If I had been able to afford a more expensive straightener by Babyliss I would hope the buttons don't look like cheap plastic.  Otherwise, 5 stars still because it works great!  Babyliss makes awesome straighteners, even the cheaper ones such as this one works nicely.

UPDATE***
Just a couple days after writing this review my straightener stopped working.  I have only had this straightener for 24 days before it broke.  I didn't drop it or expose it to water, suddenly one morning it just didn't heat up.  It turns on, but the plates don't get even remotely warm.  It showed no signs of failure prior, in fact I used it the day before and it was great.  I just wish it would not have broken, and it still deserves 4 stars because it worked well when it was working.  I noticed there was something inside the straightener that seemed loose, when I shook it a bit it sounded like a piece of plastic had broken off or something inside.  Maybe something did fall apart inside and that's why it broke, I feel this straightener could have been made with better material.  As I mentioned previously, the buttons and knob had a cheap plastic look to it, I was going to get an exchange but turns out fulfillment by Amazon is refund only.  So I suppose I'm taking my refund and spending it on another straightener instead.  I'm just paranoid even though I feel I just got a defective one.",1
I use Wen styling creme a bit differently then the directions recommend.  I rub a small amount in my hands and run it through my hair after it is dry and styled. It adds body while making my hair look smooth and frizz free. This works better for me than using it on wet hair.  I use it in place of the Wen finishing treatment.,1
"I was hoping for the best after I read that it was distributed by Helen of Troy. I have had bad luck with this product in the past as the springs were breaking and another iron just pulled my hair and didn't glide through it.
I must say that I am pleasantly surprised as the iron comes with two extra springs, it glides through the hair and holds tight when curling. I have thicker hair and need the extra heat that this iron provides. I will stick with Hot Tools by Helen of Troy if it lasts. It appears to be of excellent quality. Most beauticians use Hot Tools so this may be the one for me. But , now after one year the wiring broke just below the swivel cord. I took it apart to find out. I ordered another one because of the good heating, although this one doesn't seem to heat as good as the last one. Hot Tools has some work to do on this product but it is still better than most others. Product reliability is just not what it used to be.",1
I spent a great deal of money for a product that DID NOT live up to its promise.  It made absolutely no difference to use it.  I am very disappointed.,0
I have spent the past 2 hours attempting to sight in my crossbow with 6 of these.  Absolute junk.  12-inch groupings at 25 feet with a bench rest.  I am quite pleased for the rest of the world that these are no longer available.,0
I did not think this did anything!  I have had better results from hairspray!  I thought this would work because I saw a video about it and thought because it was so expensive that it would have good results!  I threw that money down the drain!!!!,0
"THE BEST eyeliner I've ever used. It goes on easily, dries quickly (but not too quickly!), and lasts all day. I have hooded eyelids, so I've always had the problem of eyeliner rubbing off on my upper lid... not cute! Not this eyeliner, though... it has become my go-to product. I was reluctant at first because I'm accustomed to spending maybe $7 on eyeliner, but I've decided it's worth the cost... I don't have to repeatedly check my lids throughout the day for a nice black semicircle on my upper lid!",1
"Definitely works if you are patient, however, quit using because I noticed the white of my eyes turning a yellow color.",1
"I heard about this product from a friend.  I have very dry heels, especially during the summer months.  Yu-Be moisturizing skin cream worked like a charm.  It's a bit greasy after application, but it quickly disappears.  I highly recommend it.",1
"I love this product!  There is a very, very light fragrance and the product is smooth with no grit.  The directions advise to leave on for 10 minutes and I would agree t=with that timing.  After application it slowly starts to tingle, and it rinses off easily.  After my face felt soft and looked brighter.  LOVE THAT!
I have not used the product enough times to see a reduction in pigmentation, but will report back.

Update: Some of my dark spots are lighter, my skin is more even toned than before using this product.",1
It didn't work at all. It actually made me breakout worse than I ever have. Extremely disappointed because I heard great things about these products,0
not worth purchasing with this order,0
"I use this at work after eating, I feel that's when I need it the most and I use the oil after the shower, if you are sensitive to smells you may not like this. However I love how soft it makes my skin feel. I have it 4 stars because I am 7 months pregnant, started using it at 4 months. I still have time to see if it works,  but so far so good. I am ordering more oil because I am running out, but because I only use this at work I have half the container left.",1

Great Product.",1
This iron does not curl at all. 35.00$ wasted. It does not heat up enough to put a curl in my hair.,0
"I've lived with thin edges for the majority of my life.  This product helped me find a little more confidence simply because I'm able to wear my hair up in a cute bun, or pulled back in a sexy ponytail!  These little fibers cling on and stay put, giving you a full head of hair.  I'm totally addicted!",1
"The container makes the application of this product seamless and quick. I had to wait about minute for the product to completely soak into my feet. The scent smells good.

Best use for me after I exfoliated my feet.

This product is paraben-free and contains propylene glycol.

Made in the US",1

"I researched and tried to find the best straightener for my daughter's birthday.  Although this one boasts an ""automatic turn off"" and ""made of Ryton to resist high heat,"" this straighter completely melted down to the plates when left unattended.  If we were not home, my house could have caught fire.  I would seriously like a refund of this product, but I'm past the one month ""window.""",0
"I have used these patches for at least 10 years or more and find they really do make a difference. I don't use them under my eyes but to diminish the vertical lines between my eyebrows. If I miss using them for a couple days, I find the lines have become deeper. I hope they will always be available!",1
"worst exfoliating cleanser ever, use kate somervillle instead.
beads are too few and too large, doesn't work.",0
Love this product.  It covers red areas better than anything I have used.  I used the loose powder in the same shade for my neck and jawline; but this one is better for red areas around nose and eyes.,1
"I am African American/ European and my hair can get a little wild. It's frizzy, dry, and combination of wavy and tight curls. I got this as a sample on Sephora and immediately fell in love. I bought it on Amazon because it is cheaper. Just apply apply some after I towel dry my hair and the results are amazing. My curls don't frizz, my hair feels soft all day, and I won't use anything else. Apply it with Moroccan Argon Oil and you have yourself a guaranteed fabulous hair day! I would recommend it to anybody with similar hair the results are amazing for me!",1
"I originally began with these blades because I also purchased a Merkur brand razor. At first I was scared by the amount of choice I had in blades so I stuck with the brand I knew to begin my transition into shaving from a single to double blade razor. The Merkur blade would get the job done, but the shave was not super close, and it would occasionally pull my hair. Overall it was not the most comfortable experience.

Since this pack I have moved onto trying these&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Feather-New-Hi-Stainless/dp/B001G5FOLI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Feather New Hi-Stainless</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wilkinson-Sword-Double-Edge/dp/B0006M56BK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wilkinson Sword Double Edge</a>.

I actually love this product but there was a small crack in the glass and it has leaked all over my purse in the last few months. $50 down the drain.,0
This eyeliner is difficult to put on - it's like the brush drops down and drags in it wiping some off as it is applied. It is also hard to keep it out of your lashes. I would not buy this again and hate that I spent so much on it.,0
Just like any other hair dryer,1
Great little stand at an affordable price. Holds the brush quite nicely. I just wish it was a little fancier for my Modern Chic bathroom.,1
Favorite mascara.,1
This is the color I have been looking for. I love it.,1
"Scent is somewhat ""loud"", and does not have a creamy feel to it.  I have very dry skin and hoped this cream might provide some relief.  But it did not.",0
"if you don't mind chemical sunscreen this is a good one. I am upset because the women at the counter assured me this was a physical sunscreen which its NOT. no zinc oxide in it what so ever and I didn't have my glasses on and that is MY bad. If you are concerned for hyperpigmentation and want to stop the signs of aging you must completely block the sun. chemical sunscreens only filter it. I am an esthetician and I know my info. aside from that, I love the coverage and doesn't seem to block my pores but I must stop using it because I want something that is good for my skin, not a bunch of chemicals.",0
I was told about this product by a manicurist over a year ago and I still love this stuff. it really does work if you use it daily after a shower.,1
This is my favorite face wash product. It makes your face feel so incredibly refreshed. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.,1
Is nothing special on it... just a regular concealer,0
this product works great,1
Just what I was looking for...does the trick to get eyebrows combed and groomed every morning.,1
"I got this in the mail and was excited to use it but it didn't smell anything like jasmine. I wonder if it had been diluted. It doesn't smell like anything I have purchased from the past. I use to get it from Sephora but they no longer carry it. So, I thought of ordering it from here. I'm so disappointed . Two star due to prompt delivery but not happy with the serum lacking the jasmine scent.",0
"I used this on my mother in law, she loves the color. It is a very nice neutral color.  I just like a little more sparkle, but I am glad I bought it because my mother in law and mom like neutral colors a lot.",1
"Opi never lets me down, wish it was just a bit thicker.",1
"I bought this product hoping to strengthen my nails but all it did was peel off. This is a normal problem for me with all nail lacquers and polishes. Unfortunately, my nails are still soft and peeling.",0
"If you don't already use tinted sunscreen, allow yourself some time to practice with it so you get a smooth, even coat with enough coverage to protect your skin without looking caked on.

This Obagi sunscreen applies pretty evenly, and doesn't move too much when you perspire. I am sensitive to scent, and found that after a couple of days of wearing this product, I wasn't noticing the scent as much.

As mentioned, it stayed in place when I was active and perspiring, and yet washed off at home pretty easily. It did not seem to clog my pores, and did not make my skin feel itchy. It has been reliable for me when I want to look somewhat polished and yet natural  as if all I am wearing is sunscreen, not foundation.",1
"I love the color, it lasts all day, and the application is pretty okay, but I don't think I'd spend over $10 on it again",1
Pricey but good stuff,1
Works very well.,1
I like other Bioelements products but this is not very moisturizing and has an unpleasant fragrance.  I do not recommend this product.,0
"I love this stuff, I use it as a pre-shave and then apply my shaving cream.  It makes shaving almost enjoyable.",1
"I do hair for a variety of people.  One of the people I have worked with for a long time has hair that is thick and frizzy, but on humid or hot days, the hair is CRAZY.  It is color treated and borders on being dry, although not always.  I also do hair for another person who has straighter hair but wants to have shiny and ultra straight hair.  I got this brush to use with both of them to see if we could do some new looks with their hair.

WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?
The brush comes in a box which has a hole in one side and you push and the box slides out.  Sounds silly, but it took me a bit to figure that out since I started with the other sides of the box first.  Inside is the brush with a warranty card and a brief instruction sheet.  The brush itself is a slick handle.  On the back of the handle is an on off pad which you press.  The first setting is the 320F setting and the power button blinks when it first is turned on.  There are three other settings.  To get to them you press the power button briefly and it will change temperature.

The bristles of the brush are arranged in such a way that it will discourage tangles and work through them more easily than other brushes.  The bristles on the outside are plastic but the inside ones are ceramic.  These are all different heights, staggered so that they will handle long hair more easily.  The cord is a heavy round cord and the plug is a polarized plug (on prong is wider than the other).

HOW IS THIS BRUSH TO USE?
I found that when I turn on the brush, the power light flashes and the first temperature is 320.  It says to lock in temperature, that you have to press and hold for 2 seconds.  For me, it just stayed at the temperature and I did not have to hold it.  To move it up, I simply pressed the power button and it changed.  Then you press quickly until you either get a new temperature or you turn the unit off.  I am thinking that the setting of the temperature is so that if your hand slips while using the brush, you won't accidentally have it higher than you want and not know it.  I did not have a problem with that, however.

The brush takes about 2 minutes to heat up.  At first the power light blinks when it is turned on.  When ready to use and up to temperature, the power light turns green and you are ready to go.  The cord gives plenty of length to use freely even if you are not on top of an outlet.

The brush slides through the hair quite easily.  You pull it slowly through a section of hair- not a huge section- and then move on to the next one.  The first hair I tried it on was tangled, had not been combed all day and was frizzy as could be.  It looked wild.  The brush slid through the hair VERY easily.  I set it at 320 and it was perfect.  The hotter temps made it too straight.  320 made it so that the surface was very smooth, there was still a small wave, but it was shiny and beautiful.  Frizz was gone.  Once the entire head was done, I dampened my hands and gently squeezed the hair all over to set in some wave.  The effect was beautiful.  The hair is feathered and long but tapered with multiple layers.

The second hair I used it on had a slight wave but is pretty much straight.  It also was color treated.  350 and 400 seemed to work better for this hair.  It is medium fine, but to get a good shine and straightening, the higher temperatures worked better.  This hair was not dry or fragile but quite sturdy.  The effect was a great shine and straightening and made this person very happy.  Color was accented and the shine was really nice.

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE
My only problem with this brush is that it was hard to hold on to.  The handle is slick and I found myself almost dropping it a few times.  I would prefer a handle that had some sort of gripping ability on it, a bit thicker than the one that is on there so it is easier to hold and manipulated through the hair.  This one is a bit too slick.  For that, I take off one star.

THE BOTTOM LINE
For frizzy or straight hair with a slight wave, this brush gave a great shine and eliminated frizz. It only takes about 2 minutes to heat up.  Depending on temperature used, the effect can still leave some body or you can go poker straight.  The settings are easy to do and seemed to be easy to keep in place.  You can lock settings so you don't accidentally change it while using.  Tangled hair seemed to be no problem for this brush as it slides right through if you go slowly.  If you can stand the slick handle, this is a great brush.  It has versatility to it and so far the people I have used it on really like how it performed on their hair.

I give this four stars because of the slick handle, but it is more like four and a half since the brush itself worked so well on the different types of hair I used it on.",1
"I've used this scent for many years, love it!",1
Love the product. BUT as noted in other comments the bottom of the bottle came cracked and leaking. I am so bummed. I lost about an oz of product due to the crack. It's litteraly sitting upside-down in a vase until I can get to the store to get an alternate bottle to transfer to. So much for convenience purchasing online. Next time I'll pick it up at the salon for the extra two dollars.,0
"This slant razor definitely adds a sharper shave to the mix. It's definitely been a bonus and relief to have a slanted razor in my kit. The handle is definitely a ""short"" version, but the weight is dead on fantastic. You replace blades by releasing the top half of the head by unscrewing it by the base's turn knob, so it's only a two-piece razor as opposed to the standard three. My experience so far has been that a single pass cuts infinitely closer than a regular straight razor, but your mileage may vary on hair thickness and face texture.",1
"I like this product so much, probably the best lip balm in the market now. But -1 star because of the smell.
At first couple weeks it gives off pleasant fragrance, but after several months of using it the smell goes a bit bad, like some old grease..? Well, they say you shouldn't use a lip balm after three months of opening it, because after 3-month it kinda goes bad due to continuously contacting with your lips, some saliva or food residues on your lips...... Use it up within 3 months!",1
"Unfortunately, this did not work for me. I will say it is very moisturizing and would be great for the winter; however, it actually made me oilier in my T-zone, and there is no mattifying consistency/texture whatsoever. It's just plain moisturizer.",0
Do not recommend hair had yellow tint after use that it did not have before,0
"Have used this for years for a smooth, frizz free look.  Great product.",1
"The color was pretty, but did not even stay on for 7 days even with the top coat.  If I used my other polish (china glaze) with the 7 day top coat, my polish lasted for more than 7 days.  I would not recommend.",0
I've been using this nightly for a week (applied after showering then I wear cotton socks to bed). My feet are noticeably softer. When this tube is gone I will probably try the L'Occitane pure shea butter because the shea butter content is significantly higher than this foot cream. I gave it 4 stars because of the smell. It's not repulsive but it could smell better (just my opinion).,1
All of the bristles have fallen out of the barrel.,0
"For what it is, it is great.  Matte finish.  Smells good.",1
"If you are one of those very fortunate women who can go a week without washing, maybe this product is for you. I see it as being a light touchup for that last day or two. If you have oily scalp that requires more washing, this will do nothing for you! If you just use a little bit, it does nothing. If you do more than one light pass over your roots thinking it will help, it makes it worse. Your scalp will feel so gunky and itchy, youll want to just jump in the shower and wash your hair anyway. If Im stepping out briefly in the morning the day after I wash my hair (and Im not planning on being out all day) Ill use it just to freshen up slightly and give my hair some scent. But I only do that to use up the rest of this product. My hair feels cleaner at the end of day two without using this product!",0
"Didn't work for me. First one came in Frozen. Frozen???, Yes, Frozen! First for me! but, seller made it right. Sent me another one. Still don't like it for my hair",0
"I definitely want to try other products. But I see myself getting these products again, for sure. I love how my beard feels with the styling cream.",1
"Bought this for my husband twice now. One of these lasts a full year, if not a little longer. He has thick beard hair, and loves this stuff and his safety razor. The aroma isn't overpowering, I love it. Husband loves it too. Solid product. Our only complaint is that the jar lid has cracked on the inside; there's a piece that chips off when he screws the lid back on. It doesn't take away from the cream, and it doesn't make the jar non airtight. Just annoying.",1
"Used it once. The mist was so nice and refreshing but it did not hold up. I do live in Texas, and this past Sunday (when I first tried it out) was a high 82 and humidity was around 65%. I looked and felt greasy. However, that kind of weather could make anyone's face melt, so, I decided to give it another go today. Only, when I tried to apply it this time, it came out like a squirt gun. mm.",0
"Art of Shaving Sandalwood soap creates some sick lather! Very easy to work up in your palm or with face lathering. The lather itself is thick, rich, and luxurious. In the tub the texture is more on the moist side than a cella. Exceptionally creamy. But my problem is the scent.

Sandalwood scents are one of my favorites. I like sandalwoods that are fused with citrus, or maybe other frangrant oils or essential oils to create a complex sensual experience. But this scent is a one shot pony: it smells like natural sandalwood. Nothing complex or tantalizing. Nothing to linger and tease the senses about what it is. The smell completely falls flat: it's wood! I have a sandalwood chess set, and that's what this smell like. My mother-in-law has a block of sandalwood that she uses for her prayers, and that is EXACTLY what this smell is like. To say the smell is ""boring"" would give it too much credence. It also has a weird after scent.

I can't place my finger on it, but it is like an overly waxy kind of smell. Not a fragrance. Just waxy Sandalwood. If I smelled this long it would give me a headache. But I did give it three stars because the lather was pretty sick!

If you want something to compare with AOS Sandalwood, try Trumpers Sandalwood soap. This is a triplemilled hard, so you would be comparing a cream to a soap. However, the soap has a distinct citrus smell harmonized with soft scents of Sandalwwd. One of my absolute favorite Sandalwood scents, and and another awesome lather producer. You could also try the Trumpers Sandalwood cream, which has a softer version of the sandalwood scent than the Trumper's bar, but still MUCH MUCH better than the AOS Sandalwood. ((BTW, if you are looking for a top AOS cream, I highly recomend the Ocean Kelp--See my review)  Evelyn & Crabtee also has a sandalwood, but its more of a floral scent. Pleasant, but not terribly manly. Then there is the Italian Cella

So I don't really see this Sandalwood by AOS sustaining a big part market share of ""Sandalwood soaps"" without some type of reformulation. Oh sure, they have the big name, but the really need to work on those scents. The smell is quite pedestrian, like something you would find from a vendor in the hallways at the mall, or maybe selling some cheap incense.  If you like Sandalwood, go with Trumpers Bars; notes of citrus, great moisturing, tightens skin, and smells awesome!!!! Good luck

Does a good job.,1
not impressed at all.,0
My lashes definitely grew in length and in volume! The only thing was it irritated my eyes if I applied too much or too often.,1
"No fresh smell like my original purchase. It has an odor like it might be out of date, but no date on it.",0
I was hoping this was a light cream but I find it too heavy and pore blocking.  Would not order again -,0
It seems to work ok but after the first use I had an allergic reaction to it and can't use it.,0
"Works surprisingly, but hard to apply evenly.",1
"Does not swell or plump lips as advertised, tastes like toothpaste and has to be applied often. It is a pretty color though.",0
I like this very much.,1
Works great as a skin moisturizer both for face and body.  nice for shaving and personal lubricant.  a small amount goes a long way,1
"$10 toothpaste is a luxury considering how much you can purchase regular toothpaste for. However, one tube of toothpaste does last for quite a long time, and if you grew up hating brushing your teeth because of the taste like I did, this stuff is perfect. I find I actually spend time properly brushing my teeth instead of trying to get it over with as quickly as possible, so for me this is money well spent.

Onto the problems:

Marvis is supposed to come sealed. Full-sized or travel-sized, there should be a seal inside the cap. If you received unsealed toothpaste like I did, contact customer service!",1
"This is my staple scent. My preferred scents have a ""just came out if the shower"", sweet, and a bit sexy aroma. Aquolina has notes of vanilla and cotton candy but does not seem overly bubble gum pop sweet due to the balancing caramel tones. I apply it to my pulse points in the morning and find it lingers, albeit less intense, until I shower. This is one of those perfumes that you can keep reapplying without it ever becoming an attack on other's olfactory sensations. I find jackets that hang in my closet still carry this scent for months. This perfume has been a top seller at Sephora for years for reason. I've purchased this perfume from Amazon and Sephora and found them to be identical in scent and longevity. I suggest mixing this product with an unscented lotion to further extend the aroma (it's a much cheaper alternative to purchasing Aquolina's scented body lotion).

On a side note, don't be to hasty to purchase; as when I bought this it was $20 and now it's climbed up to $60. The price seems to vary week to week, so wait it out a bit if you can.",1
It takes too long to cover the patches. The colour was too dark for brown. It was like black. It cannot be used for large areas of baldness.,0
no use for acne at all,0
"I received this as a sample in my BirchBox and immediately fell in love with the smell.  I love having a smell-good spray I can use whenever I want to 'freshen' up my hair and this has so many benefits so it's a 2 in 1! I primarily use it after washing my hair and my hair is still damp from my towel.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I haven't noticed a significant improvement since I started using it, but my hair is pretty healthy as it is so could just be me. I recommend as a daily product.",1
"this stuff is okay.. i mean, it does make your hair look fuller but it also clumps together . maybe i should try getting the applicator. i will see about ordering an applicator , but by itself the product clumps. its like throwing just black powder on your head. it doesn't really stick that well , but its not bad to be honest. its good for someone who wants thicker looking hair but i think the applicator is necessary to get good coverage.",0
"The pump does not work.  I do not know how the product itself works, as I cannot get it out of the bottle.",0
Love this stuff!!,1
"This is the best cream I have found for moisturizing ones face. Goes on clean and with low sent, and no greasy after affects.",1
An excellent product for refining skin texture that is bumpy due to Keratosis pilaris.  One caveat:  it can ruin your manicure so do not use when your nail polish is fresh.  Wait until the day before you get a new coat of polish!,1
I was so excited to you set but when i open i see this ,0
"This stuff is simply awesome.  Easy to put on, easy to shave with and leaves a great feeling once you are done.  You can not go wrong with this.",1
Maybe this is a freak incident since I always use hot tools brand but a few months ago my curling iron stopped heating up- my other one I had for nearly 8 years. So I'm trying to return and get another one. Hot tools said to check amazon return policy and then get back to them. They said mine is only for a year. Luckily I'm in that window with the manufacturers warranty. Just the hassle and disappointment. I'll update once I see if they will give me a new one with no trouble- if not I will switch brands.,0

It is HOT where I live.  I needed some kind of makeup that would not slide off and look splotchy after just a few minutes in the heat and humidity.  This product did the trick for me. It wasn't a heavy makeup it just added a bit of color to brighten my skin.  I really like it. It seems to even out my skin tone and gives a bit of a glowing finish.,1
not for me. break me out so bad!!!!,0
I am not a fan of this brand of nail lacquer.  It is thick and gloppy and difficult to apply and chips and wears off fast.  OPI is much better quality for the price.,0
"Used this makeup for a number of years. Excellent coverage, natural look, good for your skin and an SPF factor, makes it a wise choice.

In addition I received this product so quickly after ordering it I was amazed. It took about 3 days, great service!",1
"At first application, I loved the formula and thought it was perfectly light and non-greasy. After spending a morning in the sun and re-applying halfway through, I wound up totally burnt. I used a different sunscreen for my body and just used this on the face, both had the same SPF number, and my face was the only part of me that was burnt. This is absolute trash. Dont buy it.",0
"Totally surprised, after years of using this product, the last two batches I've purchased are of much lower than the claimed Holding value of 10....Has the producers watered down the product???? The application will last, at least 12 hours...NOT ANYMORE! It only lasts few hours....I think it is time to change brand....",0
Does not straighten or curl here as advertised at all.,0
"headaches and swollen face, Iam really supprised this is FDA approved/  Maybe it isn't how would we know.",0
"This is one of my favorite hair care products, both for the scent and the nice control it gives to my heat styled thick hair.

Regarding Big Bang Beauty, I placed an order on December 27th. It's January 25th and I've seen no sign of it. After my repeated requests as to where my package was (they created a tracking # and everything!), they admitted they didn't have it and refunded me BUT promised to send the product as a good faith gesture. Nice, but that was another lie. They keep saying they'll send it but I've given up. Buyer beware. UPDATE: I received the order January 28th but still have a bad taste in my mouth about this experience.  Big Bang Beauty convinced me to remove my negative feedback but I didn't realize I couldn't rewrite feedback after deleting.  Hoping to make other purchasers aware of this seller's less than satisfactory practices.",1
The liner kept falling out. I returned it.,0
Good buy. This is one product to be tried definitely. Strong odor. Perfectly suitable men's spray!,1
"The best lubrication I've found for a quick shave, but it really clogs up the blade.  It's also transparent, making it difficult to see what areas have been shaven for people with thin facial hair.  The scent is basically non-existent, which I consider a plus.  If you need to shave in a hurry, you'll be very glad you have this.",1
works like a dream...very very happy with this product and all of their products.  very high quality....I would definitely recommend,1
"I was not happy with this colongne , I think it DOSENT seem like the one I normally buy from macys. The smell does not last. So I am thinking it is a knockoff !!",0
"Although I didn't buy from amazon, I wanted to write a review. I bought it from ULTA after hearing and seeing many youtubers rave about it. Immediately after spraying I observed that my skin felt dry. It also broke me out. I will be returning this.",0
Disappointed.  The handle was too short.  It keeps on slipping from my hand.,0
Very disappointed in the product,0
"Like it. Leaves hair so soft, it doesn't feel like hairspray!!",1
"Hard to understand the rave reviews for this product.  I have thick, curly, rather frizzy hair.  This cream does help with the frizz but it's quite drying.  It isn't greasy but I didn't find it alt all moisturizing, either.  After using the cream with the Love conditioner for two weeks my hair was like straw.  It is dry anyway but the Davine products made the dryness worse.  Both products have an unnatural scent and are full of weird chemicals.  The label reads: ""With almond extract from Mr. Assenza's farm, Syracusa, Italy.""  That doesn't make the Davine line natural. Many hair care products contain some almond oil, and it doesn't matter where the almonds are grown.  Nearly every other ingredient listed on the curl enhancer cream is some five-syllable chemical.  The Love conditioner irritates my eyes badly after I rinse it, which cannot be good for me.  i bought the Davine products during a moment of weakness on a bad hair day and regret the $65.00 I dropped on them.  I might use them once in a while or just throw them both out.  It's back to John Masters--which really is a natural line.",0

"I'm in my 30s and have struggled with adult acne since teenage acne. Prescription medicines are way too harsh on my skin,  and I find other liquid based treatments too cumbersome for my extremely busy life (with 6 hours devoted to sleep/night,  I don't have much time to afford to skin care,  unfortunately). These pads have cleared up my skin like you wouldn't believe! They are quick, easy,  and very effective.  However,  I usually but them on clearance at tjmaxx for around $7, the amazon price is much better than the $38 retail.  They are very worth it,  even at full price!",1
Made my hair very dry feeling,0
"The eyeshadow will make lines after just a few hours, runs too easily",0
Lasted about  2 weeks with just  the recommended applications of 2x a day.  A bit pricey for such a small amount of product,0
"Hello!
did not like",0
"This does not fit the new T3 Featherweight dryer. And, on top of that, had to pay to have it returned. Ugh.",0
"I bought this initially when I was vacationing in Las Vegas.  I thought the price was ridiculous because it was Vegas...but it turns out it's just expensive.  That is why I have knocked a star off of this review.

However, I am still repurchasing, regardless, because it is that great.  It smells nice, sprays great, and best of all - it's not sticky and doesn't leave a film on your skin like other spray sunscreens.  The aloe in it also moisturizes my skin in the sun.

LOVE this sunscreen - just wish it was a little cheaper.",1
"I have extremely sensitive skin, and DermaDoctor's Calm, Cool, and Corrected face wash has been great.  The packaging, however, is terrible.  It's a glass bottle, folks.  One day, I dropped it in the shower (I'm not a clumsy person; it just happens sometimes), the bottle shattered (see picture), and the product got washed down the drain.  I wrote the company's customer service over a week ago just giving them a heads up that this happened (I wasn't looking for compensation in any way and noted that in my email) and never received a response.  Because of these things, I'm not planning on using this product anymore.  I've since been using Vanicream's Gentle Facial Cleanser instead with great results and at a cheaper cost.",0
"This is the only product I use for moisturizing and sunscreen. This was recommended by my Dermatologist 11 years ago and I've used it ever since. I have eczema and my face is very sensitive to most products except this one. It is non greasy, but leaves your face feeling very soft and totally moisturized and protected. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.",1
Mine had to be one of the fakes that are mentioned in previous reviews!  Not like my other Chi that I bought at Ulta. Poor quality. Only worked once!,0
"Item delivered on time, was as described",1
"This is the most terrible moisturizer I've ever used. It does not rub in at all. It cakes all over your face and does not get absorbed by the skin at all - even after an 8 hour day! I don't prefer going to work looking like a ghost. Plus, my skin is breaking out more and looks more dull and tired. My skin did not like this product at all. For $45, it's definitely not worth the steep price at all. Very disappointed.",0
"I really just don't like the scent. I must have been out of my mind - ordering a perfume online without actually smelling it - but I was hoping that since this fragrance received so much hype, I wouldn't have to worry about that. Well, I was wrong.

This doesn't smell like cotton candy, marshmellows, cupcakes, etc to me at all. It actually reminds me of my grandmother's house - so maybe the bakery relation is still mixed in there somewhere. However, I really just cannot stand the scent. Perhaps I'm just not a perfume person. I do however, love my DKNY Fresh Blossom perfume. The thought of a hair perfume for me was ideal, since I usually just spray my hair with my favorite fragrance any ways, but nope - Pink Sugar just isn't my particular type of scent. I really cannot wait until this stuff wears out of my hair right now. I'd prefer the smell of my daily shampoo wayyy more than this stuff in it.

So basically, if you like Pink Sugar - great. I envy that because I truly did want this to be my favorite fragrance; I guess it's just not meant to be. Furthermore, I'll continue looking for that perfect signature scent.",0
"Hard to find a nice mascara anymore, but this one is great. Very smooth/creamy and lash lengthening.  I bought the primer too.  Great product.",1
Excellent lotion for the face. Soft skin..,1
Its expiration date is in just 3 months. This was not mentioned in the description.,0
"I am revising this review. I did love this toothbrush, until it stopped working 3 months, and one day after I got it. Amazon did not stand behind this product. I went through the company, and sent it back. Did not get any reply of any kind. I have called them 3 times, no reply. This is not an inexpensive item. Customer service sucks, and I want to let the public know. Stay away from this item. I spent 160.00 to brush my teeth for 3 months. So mad.",0
"Used once.  Gets so hot, you can't touch the finger holding pads on each side.  Very Dangerous!  Don't buy this.  And they only allowed a 30 day return window, instead of the usual 90 days.  No wonder.",0
It dries out the acne but also dries out your skin. Not to be used daily or all over your face,1
"This is my beautiful redheaded wifes secret to keeping her (what God had really intended) red hair fresh and bright. If she's happy, I'm Happy.",1
I could never get the product out of this style bottle. Needs a pump. I ended up tossing it out of frustration.  my loss.,0
After 1 month only blows cold air,0
Great brand but too oily for my skin !!,0
"I have not seen it do any thing for my ""damaged"" skin.  It is also a bit greasy so I only use it in the winter when my skin is dry.  Otherwise, it runs havoc with my naturally oily skin. It is also a chemical based sunblock (although it does offer some mineral based protection).  Go with something more natural with less chemicals that will offer better protection.  This product is not worth it for its price.",0
"Oh. my. god. The smell is horrific. It's like wet spoiled leather, a stain something-horrible. It lingered everywhere and made my bed and clothes reek. The color isn't worth the experience, stick with Jergens.",0
"This machine works, when it works.  I bought one and after 2 months it was not working.  The company did not send ""replacement parts"" for 2 months, then when they were received it did not work.  They delayed sending a new machine, and then when asked to extend the warranty since the maching had not been working for three months, they denied it.  Then when I asked them to reimburse me the shipping fee it cost me to send the defective maching back, they said no.  They were rude, and interuppted me, and were very hesitant about helping me at all.  When you spend a lot of money on a product, you expect to be treated respectfully on the phone, and to receive decent service when you have a problem.  I do not recommend this product, because of the problems I have had with it, and the company.",0
"I loved this hairspray until the propellant ran out while there was still LOTS of product left in the can.
I was still considering buying it again until I saw that the price had doubled. Definitely not a good buy now.",0
not what I ordered. the bottle is labeling and cap different. Parfum does not last 2 hrs.,0
I have suffered from KP since puberty but only recently went to the dermatologist for a diagnosis after my symptoms worsened and I was left feeling embarrassed showing my arms in public.  I researched all the available products and decided on the Glytone based on other reviews.  I have been using both the wash and cream for 2 weeks now and am very satisfied. I suffer from Keratosis Pilaris Rubra (red inflamed bumps).  These products have greatly improved my skin texture.  I have much fewer plugged hair follicles and my skin is smoother than it's been in years.  The redness has also improved. I highly recommend.,1
Meh. It goes on pretty dry and flaky. My lashes look crunchy and don't hold a curl. I'll be sticking with my Dior primer.,0
"The blend of vanilla, apple, with a hint of spice notes that make up Hugo Boss Orange Man is a pleasant smelling fragrance.  Other positive attributes include versatility to be worn for most events regardless of time of day or season.  Additionally, Orange is safe for the office.

Regarding performance, after two hours, Orange diminished to a skin scent.  I really want to love this fragrance, but the performance issues only garner a solid like for the fragrance community.  My final tally for Orange is 3.9 stars out of 5 stars  the saving grace is the fact that it is a pleasant smelling fragrance.  Take a pass on this release by Hugo Boss unless you are an avid collector.

Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting",1
Softer than Obsession and honestly much more invitng for others,1
Love glominerals products and can only get them online where I am right now. This is the first camouflage that I absolutely love!! Guessed on the shade I would need but after reading others recommendations picked the right one. I am sold!!,1
"I have cuddle up pink and daredevil, and I love both of them! They're super hydrating and don't bother my sensitive lips at all! Compared to a lot of other high end brands, these are definitely worth their price!",1
"I don't know how anyone can bear the scent. Smells like old lady perfume to the max! Definitely a no go for men. Also the hold is very light, my hair kept coming undone within 20 minutes.",0
"Very shiny, dries quickly, and a great smooth finish",1
Product dries out quickly but I love the color and precision.,1
"I'm 38 with long hair, so it's starting to come out more. I don't want to chop it off though. I wash my hair every other day, in combination with the Nioxin 2 conditioner. After a couple months, I did notice that I didn't see as much scalp on my head. In fact, I got to the point where I thought ""I don't need this stuff. I can't really see my scalp."" So I stopped using it as soon as my bottle ran out and within the next few months, I was back to seeing scalp. WARNING: The first few weeks will freak you out, because you will notice more hair loss than normal as the product adjusts to your head. This means it's working. The new hair will grow back in soon enough (you'll notice little hairs sticking straight up on your head). Stick with it. The hair that initially falls out won't be noticed by anyone else, but you. I have to have conditioner to keep my hair from being tangled/ratted. The Nioxin conditioner is better than nothing, but it doesn't make my hair as soft as other conditioners. However, I'm just happy to have hair at this point, so I can live with it not being as soft. I may even try using another conditioner once a week to keep it soft. The main reason why I know Nioxin works is because beauticians always told me I had really thick hair. One day, one told me I had ""fine"" hair. I asked for layers and she said it wouldn't look right since that only works with people who have thicker hair. Another beautician told me practically the same thing. Once I started using Nioxin, nobody has ever made another comment about my hair being thin or ""fine.""",1
This simply didn't work.,0
ordered this after reading such great reviews... does absolutely nothing for my acne... waste of money. moreover after u apply it.. u move around the house with this stuff on the face...which is kind of uncomfortable.. as personally i would prefer clear lotions.,0
Hoped this would be like Rusk Sensories Bright...not the same.  Not even close.,0
more than a half of the bottle is alcohol. it smells really bad. I returned it because I couldn't stand the smell.,0
love it - super flattering color for red heads,1
as advertised.,1
"Bit overpriced for a toner, I suggest you shop around the low end to determine the necessity before clamoring for a product like this.",0
i returned this product b/c it didn't seem like there was anything in the bottle.,0
"Expensive, didn't notice any results that justified spending $80 more than I normally do for skin care. I did like the face lotion, but the price is outrageous. I seemed to break out more using this facial wash than I did with a $6 bottle of Clean & Clear.",0
"it a fake version of the real thing...don't buy this copy/fake immitation of the real thing. besides, none of the major department stores carry it. it smells good for two minutes then it evaporates",0
"I just received this as a sample from when I ordered the moisturizer (which I wave not yet received). The box the tube is in was totally flattened and is so small even with magnifying reading glasses I can't read the writing on the box much less the tube. I have no idea what this is for or how to use it. All I can read is ""SOOTHING REPAIRING BALM Skin irritation in adults, children and babies."" What on earth does that mean??? The rest I either can't read or is not in English. Maybe this is a good product but I will never know!",0
"This makes my skin feel amazing!  It has very small round beads, so you can feel it working, but it doesn't feel like it's being way too aggressive.  I use this along with the other Pevonia cleanser and moisturizer for my skincare routine.",1
"I've had two now, my second one just died this morning.  No warning, slow down, funny sounds or anything.  Just won't turn on anymore.  No thanks, no more.",0
Very nice would buy again. Holds up well in easy case. File groves to take off those pointy bits. Has rough & medium side which is great. I would give it a 5 star if it had a under nail cleaning hook.,1
"I love the AHAVA brand and use their foot lotions as well as mud soap.  I wanted a liquid cleanser and found this to be very strong as it irritated my skin, I felt a burning sensation when using it and god forbid it gets anywhere near your eyes.  It is not a gentle nor soothing cleanser at all, very rough.  Ill stick to the mud soap ive been using for years.",0
The gum tastes like crap and that ruins the whole thing. Not worth it. Should not waste the money. HOpe this helped,0
good,1
My FAVORITE hair spray! Holds but let's your hair flow free. Not sticky. You won't look like helmet head!,1
I have thick and coarse hair. But this doesn't do me the favor as it has promised. Disappointing!,0
"I bought this dryer from Sephora to try it out. The gal said the compact was just the same as the larger, so thought I'd try it first and could get the bigger one on exchange to try if I had any issues.

I've been using it exclusively for a few weeks now, and don't know how I lived without it before. I have thin and fragile hair, that is curly/frizzy. My frizz is SO much less and the quality of my hair after blowing it out is so much better. I normally would have to flat iron or curl even after blowing out - with this I don't. Would recommend to anyone with hair like mine.

I can't say that it dries my hair faster than the drug store counter part, I think it takes a little longer but is SO worth it!",1
Works great but saw in store shortly after purchase for much better price make sure to shop around a bit,1
"As a Pernox user of more than two decades, I bought this product based on recommendations that Yu-Be Skin Polish was an acceptable - even superior - substitute for Pernox.  Perhaps for others this was true but it definitely was true not for me.  The granules are quite large when compared to the fine texture of Pernox and Yu-Be does not have the uniform consistency of Pernox.  Whereas Pernox could correctly be called a skin polish the effect of a cleansing with Yu-Be Skin Polish with its widely spaced apart, fat granules feels more like skin gouging & scraping than skin polishing.  As well, the most effective ingredient in Pernox, salicylic acid, is missing from Yu-Be and Yu-Be contains no acidic ingredient substitute that would compensate for this absence.

This is not a horrible product but it is no where near as effective as Pernox.  There are other products at less than half the price at the local drug store that are comparable to Yu-Be for less than half the price.  As for a product that is favorably comparable to Pernox, this is not it.",0
"Doesn't work for me. I've followed the directions and gotten advice from others who love this product. Just be warned: it doesn't work for ALL hair types. For mine, it's heavy and sticky (even when applied with a light hand).",0
"I have boughten several brushes in 2017, looking for the perfect one, well, I just found it!  This brush gives you control of where your hair goes.  I cannot say enough about it.  I love the sound it makes while running it through my hair, its light, just enough bristles so you don't have that extra roll scratching your ear or your forehead, its perfect!",1
"This is a good product.  Purchased to replace similar one I had used for several years.  The ""On"" button is slow and requires multiple heavy depressions to start.  Had to contact seller regarding delivery which was slow.",1
"Purchased this product had a reaction, tuned my skin red and rashes. Finally results left my skin black and sca red still trying to recover. 3 months later",0
it's good for me,1
Horrible. I doesn't last an hour and the smell :S. I can't believe it is original,0
"Although i liked how the lotion felt, my skin didn't show any improvement after a month, and actually looked older.",0
"I have short, fine, wavy, highlighted hair.  After receiving a sample of Oribe Shampoo and Conditioner for colored hair, I started using it almost every day, but I like to change shampoos and conditioners every once in a while.  I tried Oribe for Volume and Shine but didn't like it.  The Signature Shampoo & Conditioner works better for me every once in a while.",1
"First time user of this new pencil.  The first time I used up the product tip and then attempted to twist the tube to get more to come out for use, it broke off, twice!  I am not sure this product will work for me if all it takes is a couple of twists of the tube and the tip pops off, and then again!  Also, I do not feel my brows have a natural look using this pencil.  But this product does have good coverage, and takes care of any bare spots in the eyebrow.  Bottom line, pencil is overpriced for what you get.",0
"One of the sticks had obviously sat on the shelf for some time because the stick had shrunk in size.
This product is a combination of volatile fragrance and volatile alcohol which when combined will evaporate...
thus the shrinkage. The seller offered me a replacement free of charge and shipping. I decided the effort
wasn't worth the effort so I kept the shrunken stick which still did its job of killing underarm bacteria & providing
fragrance. This IS NOT an anti-persperant stick. Just deodorant.  All in all, great service and a proven product.
I've been using this product since 1980 from mostly high end mall providers. Just make sure you require this seller
to give you a fresh product. Otherwise no complaints.",1
Did not work for me :(,0
"This has an unpleasant smell and was irritating to my skin.  I would never pay this price, I tried a sample.",0
Not what I expected,0
I like this conditioner more for the smell than the effect. It is a woodsy almost musky smell that I love since everything on the market smells sugary or flowery these days. It works well to condition but it isn't the best conditioner out there.,1
"I have been an Ahava customer for a number years and have purchased all of their products, direct from Ahava, at one time or another. It is a good and solid brand (they are, unfortunately, not an all-natural brand, but their products are on the milder side). It had been some time since I made any new purchases, though, since they began raising their prices so prohibitively. I just purchased three of these Ahava salt soaps through Amazon because the price seemed to drop a bit. What I received, however, was a fraction of the already smallish soaps I love and remember (the bars are now a shocking 4.75 x 7.25 x 2.25 mm! --the size of hotel sample soaps!). Also, cornstarch seems to have moved up to become the main ingredient in the soaps (it was always a filler, but not in as great a quantity as it is now). Still, the soap is still mild and clean, and I would be happy to reorder, as it is still one of the better soaps on the market for skin of any type (gentle, curative, and very pleasantly mild-scented), but there is no justification for paying $6, let alone $9+ for a microscopic sample size of soap. If the price came down even further (even if I had to purchase a case at a time), I might stock up and recommend others do the same. But there are plenty of well-sized bars of soap on the market that are both natural and also gentle, and those manufacturers manage to cover their overhead costs (ie, for ""dead sea"" salt) just fine and not charge an arm and a leg for something that is such a bath staple--regardless of how good its quality is (and especially considering how many corners have been cut--and trimmed down here).",0
Not moisturizing. Love the deep conditioner and leave-in but not the shampoo too much.,1
Very disappointed.  This did not fit my Conair 1875 watt Model 185R blow dryer.  Not worth shipping back.  Might be adventagious for seller to specify the largest diameter this will fit.,0
"Very drying to my hair.didn' feel good. Used once, very disappointed. My hair texture is 3c to 4c with mostly 4a and b",0
"I have mixed feelings on this concealer. My first impression was that it had the consistency of CLAY! Definitely NOT pliable or creamy at all!

I had intended on using my concealer brush but ended up tapping the top of the concealer repeatedly and surprisingly after only about 5 taps, there was a sufficient amount to tap and pat to blend under my eye (one eye) . After tapping it repeatedly I tried to blend it abit for a better finished result. (*It does NOT blend easily at all) but all in all it only took about a minute or 2 to do one undereye area and it is a very dry finish but that is what makes it stay in place and not cake into wrinkles like the more liquid concealers that glide on so easily.

Don't get me wrong, at first I was  sure I did not like it when it went on so oddly compared to other concealers I've used in the past (and I am in my 50's so I've tried a LOT!
After putting it on I applied a mineral foundation that this works very well with, I don't think it would be so great with a liquid foundation but it seems that it was made for a mineral one as Scott-Vincent Borba also sells a mineral foundation.

So I was pleasantly surprised that it does diminish my fine under eye lines as it does not settle and weep into them as the day wears on. The coverage is decent, I've never found one that eliminated them entirely and this does as good a job as most 've used in the past, as far as the dark circles go.

All in all if you are older like me this is worth a go IF you are  using a mineral foundation and want a concealer that stays put and doesn't melt into the wrinkle creases making them look worse! I got the light 01 fair/light shade, I wish I had gotten the next darker shade as I read that it had a bit more yellow in it and I have that hue in my skin and it might have looked even better.",1
"So far so good, it is true that you can't actually see the product but I can tell I'm not getting sunburn and it's not making me break out like other sunscreen... I would definitely recommend!",1
"This shampoo does get your hair clean, but only after using a lot of it.  It's not at all concentrated, so it's hard to get it anywhere other than the top of your head without losing a bunch of it, and because it's so thin, the bottle gets used up pretty quickly.  It has a tendency to get in your eyes and it stings quite fiercely.  It seems more like a marketing gimmick than a shampoo made for someone with an oily scalp and dry ends; however, it does seem to keep my hair clean for a couple of days.  It is not, however, gentle on dry ends -- it makes them worse and a lot of conditioner is required to combat how tangled it leaves the hair.  It not so much a bad shampoo, as a bad value, but it would really work best on oily scalp and oily hair.  Smell is on the mild to medium side, and a little bit medicinal, but not unpleasant.",0
My wife loved it! It also smells great!,1
"I really like these products but they are watered down a bit too much, so less creamy.  It smells nice and combined with the shampoo my hair falls out less.  So far, so good!",1
"I bought this straightener September 16th 2014. I did a lot of research and it looked like this was a great product. It was really expensive at $198 but I decided I wanted to spend some money for good quality. I think it did a fantastic job on my hair. It definitely took me less time to straighten it than I am used to. I don't straighten my hair everyday because I don't want the heat damage. I would like my usage light to moderate. The straightener has a fail-safe shutoff if you leave it on. I have really liked that feature because you don't want to worry about it being left on after you leave the house. I went to use my straightener a few weeks ago and it wouldn't turn on. I checked the electrical box to see if it tripped a fuse/switch. I turned it off and on a few times and I hit test/reset on the unit several times. The straightener was completely dead. After contacting Amazon they allowed me to return the item, but charged a $29.70 re-stocking fee. Now I am out the straightener and the money for the restocking fee. It was a great product while it worked. I have bought $20 straighteners from Walmart that have lasted for YEARS with heavy use. This was really disappointing. Buyer Beware: Works great while it works...",0
"My wife and I have been using a FIT for the past month.  It rinses easily so no issue switching between users.  She likes that it completely removes her make up and freshens her skin.  I would argue that a wet facecloth was good enough, but wanted to try the thing and see what it's all about.

I'm a male and my nose area has large pores, my facial skin is a bit mottled from acne ealier in life.  After some weeks using the Fit I must say 'I get it'.  It's been doing what a facecloth never did.  My pores appear visibly smaller and my facial skin is less mottled.  I think it's partly to more regular use, but mostly because the gentle brush vibrating against the skin has an affect unlike the much more abrasive wet rag.  I believe further continued use will improve my skin further.

Physically the unit itself is well designed.  Waterproof, easy to clean, to hold and to use.  The charging base is nice but thankfully long battery life means it can live in a drawer.",1
"This works  so great.  It is the first curling iron I have ever bought that I do not leave on  the highest setting.  I have thick, long hair and it curls it with ease.  The only thing is, the cord does not rotate well and I have to unwind it. I can easily overlook that though because I love how it curls.",1
I have order this product since 16 of august till today 16 of September I still have receive the product.  So I am very disappointed.  N no happy with everything,0
"Maybe products is great. But I used pure , organic product for my body, This I ordered for somebody. Expensive, and a lots of chemicals, I never buy again. I did not return. product has some herbal, algae, but parrabens listed too.",0
Love this polish and the color ranges they carry!,1
Great flavor so.,1
Great color!,1
"It is small, not very much volume of scent in this container.",1
This product is super expensive and I saw zero results. Look further.,0
"This stuff is a life saver when my skin starts to get really red and irritated. It does such an incredible job that I don't really have to use it regularly, only when my skin gets angry. 10/10 will buy again.",1
These make doing the underside of your hair much easier.  They also hold up the curls while they cool so that they stay in longer.  I purchased these with my CHI ARC curler.  Makes waves a breeze!,1
wont buy this again,0
"Do not buy from this company. This is not pureology shampoo in this pureology bottle. I don't even think it is shampoo at all. The bottle came with the lid taped shut. I thought that was wierd but I tried it anyway. This stuff made my hair stiff, coarse and dirty feeling. I had to wash it out with another shampoo. It would not rinse out! Amazon stop selling from this company.",0
"I bought this for my daughter. She always breaks out with hives from the regular sunblock. We thought it was Aloe Vera but when we had her tested for allergies, they ruled out Aloe Vera and could not pin point why she would break out with hives.
With this sunscreen, I'm happy to say No Hives and it did its job for sunblock. Worth the money!! I'd buy again.",1
Works great. Especially for thick hair. Definitely a good investment for it's price.,1
its better if you buy at the Sabon store. product was dry.. at the store its has the oils that supposed to be on it.. maybe product was old and that is why was dry.. very disappointed.,0
"Its decent, but doesnt dry as quickly as some reviewers claim. I do have thick hair though, so thats a tough feat to pull off. As others said, it doesnt get super hot. This is probably better for the hair, but it leaves me feeling like it doesnt dry as quickly as it should. I actually returned this for the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium which I found for cheaper than this dryer, and am amazed at its quality.",1
"lets start by saying... i'm 31 yrs old and don't have really really bad saggy neck skin but i was noticeing that it was looking thin.. i have layed out and tanned quite a bit in my life. i first received a sample of this cream from a local spa in my area. the sample only lasted about a week. but i loved it!
i purchased this from amazon and i've used it twice a day for about a month. i can definitly see that my neck skin doesn't seem as loose. i mean this isn't going to keep people from getting face lift or neck surgeries, but for people that just need a little help i highly suggest this one! i love it!!",1
I couldn't believe I found this for such a good price. I was a little skeptical about buying cologne online but this made me a believer. My hubbie has had it for about 6 months now and it still smells great on him. It's not watered down at all and is a quality product at a reasonable price. I will be ordering more soon.,1
Great,1
"Feel like shampoo has been watered down, not the normal consistency Conditioner appears fine.  Will probably return.",0
"Absolutely an amazing product, makes my hair look full!! ",1
"I was not going to leave a comment but I have changed my mind after my very good experience with B-glowing the seller. I am very impressed with them and their customer service.
In France (where I am originally from), we used this product a lot. I think it really works better on tanned skin. It really gives a nice glow and it is not greasy at all. In France you can find it anywhere (chemists, department stores) so I did not rush in to buy it thinking I would find it in the US too. Big mistake! I was getting married and I desesperately needed this oil. Luckily I found it on Amazon several days before my wedding and paid the expensive 2 days delivery service.  The seller send it very quickly. Unfortunately Fedex took actually 1 week to deliver (the worst thing was on their tracking system, it showed my order was already delivered).
The day before my wedding, I contacted the seller and explained that I still had not received my order. They couriered another one with delivery next day before 10am. It came right on time for my big day! Thank you B-glowing. Great vendor.",1
"I had high hopes for this product after a friend recommended it.  After using it for a couple of weeks, my skin started to look stretched out where I had placed it and there was no visible improvements to the dark spot.",0
"I have ordered Nectifirm a few times now. Subjectively, I think that the skin on my neck area looks less dry and creased. I will continue to buy this product, as I believe it is worth the money.",1
Have definitely seen an increase in hair growth since starting this product. My only problem is keeping the applicator on the glass vial - keeps falling off.,1
"I love Toppik's product, but the spray tool is useless. When I spray it on it just poofs away the powder and leaves my scalp still exposed. I hope they come up with a better application tool.",0
"I purchased on sale and glad I did so (original price was $45). The color is nice, but my nails chipped after three days.",1
Great bottle!,1
"Another great product from Oribe, I am very happy they offer this in a travel size before deciding  if I should purchase the full size. This Masque definitely rates a 5 star for smoother more manageable hair. I found after leaving this in for half an hr my hair was shiny and my frizz was dramatically  reduced. I also went longer in between  coloring my hair than usuausual. Very impressive  stuff.",1
"About 20 years ago (ugh feeling old), this was THE perfume/cologne that the cool kids wore. I decided recently that it still smells pretty darn good and wanted to go retro like the secret hipster that I am. Everyone in their 30s & 40s recognizes the scent even if they don't know exactly that it's CK1. My only complaint is that it can give me a headache. Worth it.",1
Didn't whiten my teeth at all..,0
I cannot tell any difference - have been using for 3.5 weeks - will give another few weeks. Could be that none of these creams work.,0
Not worth it...too many men's items.  One of the most useless boxes I have purchased.,0
Mardi Gras madness...perfect,1
This stuff really works! I tried a ton of other products before accidently trying this. After one day of using it at a business I had to buy it. Totally not greasy.,1
"I love this body lotion! I always apply it after a nice shower or bath. It has a fragrant aroma that lingers for a long, long time. This is by far my favorite scented body lotion.",1
It's fake ....,0
"Mascara  did not prove  any of the described  qualities: it is watery , almost dripping of lashes  during the application, then turns into clamps immediately. I managed to remove the excess with a brush and hoped it stays through the day. At lunch I had racoon eyes already...",0
not sure if it is working I like the feel and it seem to feel ok but I won't know if it works or not until I use it for a couple months I would think I don't see a difference yet.,1
Boycott Ahava if you care about human rights! Their products come from stolen Palestinian natural resources in the Occupied Territory of the Palestinian West Bank. [...],0
Not what i expected it looks very orange and is very dry,0
"I love the smell (smells like actual sandlewood). Smell is 100% subjective though. Lather and slickness are perfect for shaving my head, with a safety razor, before my eyes are fully opened in the morning. This helps keep my dome smooth and conditioned. If you're looking for a classic and enjoyable experience buy a tube of this stuff.",1
It blow dries my hair without damaging at a pretty quick pace.,1
It's a very nice shade of pink... just a little brighter than natural lip color...not too bright ...not too dark. A great everyday color. I love matte lipstick. My only negative is that it is very drying. Use a lip balm on your lips before applying.,1
"While this product didn't remove any skin dryness, but it did feel as if the skin tightened some what. The treatment definitely feels like something is working under the skin. Because my skin was still dry and peeling with this product, I had to use extra moisturizer on top of this one.",1
great,1
"Horrible product & waste of money !!! I had to return this product ughhh waste of time too!!! I bought this product thinking is going to work dahhh wrong again!! If you have ingrown hair nothing will work permanent beside going to the dermatologist because they need to do a procedure. However, if you want something temporary then go for B&C tight skin. I am Just sick of those fake reviews saying it work perfectly B.S.",0
Didn't realize they were so small. So expensive for something so tiny. Won't be purchasing again.,0
It was great the first two times but after the second use it split at the seam. Very flimsy.,0
not weight loss.  I did go.... alot,0
Good product,1
gently whitens teeths without any sensitivity,1
Love the color!!! I wanted the brown (medium shade not too light nor dark) lipstick for a change so Lisa is the right pick.,1
smell makes one want to gag and i don't think it did much. now sitting on shelf as a waste. I may have honestly had to try harder but I suppose its a moot point at this time. Trying other options -- dietary changes for weight loss,0
"I love, love, love this shampoo. My hair hasn't looked and felt this good in years.",1
This stuff is great!  Very happy with this purchase and will definitely be buying some more for gifts and for myself!,1
great color.  I love it.,1
"this is probably one of my favorite products from eshave cause it really does what it says it does. Ive been using it for about a month and its done a great job at clearing, toning , and moisturizing my skin up nicely. One problem I did find is for daytime use it is a bit shiny. I just put less on than instructed on the instructions however I am finding the more Im using it the less shiny. I believe my pores are opening up more and more every day and this product is absorbing greater than just sitting on the surface of my skin. Not saying that will happen to you but thats my experience with it hence the 4 star rating.",1
The curling iron itself it excellent but the dial that measures the amount of heat you want is flimsy. Mine actually broke. The plastic is so cheap it created stress cracks then finally fell off. Now I have no way of controlling the temperature. I bought this curling iron 9 months ago. Bummed!,0
This color looks amazing!!,1
Heats up quickly and has a smooth cord that doesn't get tangled. The size of this tool is only good if you have long hair or if you just want a flip at your ends.,1
Doesn't work used whole tub as instructed.,0
"LOVE. I tested briefly at Kohls, purchased online because it's cheaper, and this mascara so far has been beat out many others. I have a decent two step mascara, but it takes forever to apply coat after coat to get results. This mascara, 1 tube, 1 coat, was equal and better than the 2 step! Length, volume, really like it. I of course like to add more than one coat, and couple with a $10 heated lash curler, I'm a happy girl.",1
"Honestly, I purchased this product to prevent my eye wrinkle.
The cream itself is really really thick, which surprised me. However, I still got wrinkles after I used this product.
Now, not only I feel kinda old, I also feel stupid and wasteful to buy this product.",0
"The shipper must have added water before it was shipped.  It has a pleasant smell, but is ~99% water?  Not very satisfied with this as an aftershave.  I expected more from Imperial Barber Products.",0
Had to buy this when the mit that came with my Tarte bronzer tore. I am so glad this was available since I had a lot of product left. This is very similar to the one that came from Tarte originally,1
"With the new 'Super Lice' going around we decided it to take any chances!  Not only is tea tree oil a repellant, this shampoo is really going to get you going in the morning. You scalp feel clean and invigorated. This product went well above my expectations.",1
Better than expected.,1
Nice dark gray/ black,1
"I ignored the other reviews, which was a mistake. This is definitely a knock-off. When I opened it the gold lettering was completely worn off the front and the bottle color isn't quite right. Don't buy!",0
Smells terrible,0
"This product does not provide a strong hold.  At all.  I'm not sure what it is intended to do. As other reviewers mentioned, it does have a non-gloss finish and not the best odor.  But mostly importantly, it just doesn't hold hair in place.",0
Battery lasted 6 months. My Clinique scrubber literally went a year before indicating a charge was needed. I'll try and have Clarisonic RMA this thing. I like the beard setting but screw it I'll shave if this keeps up.,0
"don't waste your money, tried it twice does not work, save your money, does nada and where any time, joke",0
"The product is good but the container is not. It's not working and it costs a lot, so I don't know how I will use it because the pump is not working anymore after 5 days of use.",0
Just received my package in the mail. Leaked all over. Will definitely not purchase again for this price when part of it was wasted. What a mess.,0
It makes my eyelids sore and turn red after applying it. It never happened with Revitalash or LiLash that I have used before. It's ok to use on my eyebrow though. I'm going back to Revitalash.,0
"I have baby fine, thin hair that needs some help to stay looking volumized during the day, so I thought I would give this a try.  First of all, this has a very strong masculine scent to it.  I needed to open the window to air the bathroom out after using this product.  Secondly, I didn't really notice that it did very much for my hair.  The spray comes out in a very powerful blast wherever you are applying it so it blows away whatever styling you have done.  This product just didn't work for me.  I am so glad I purchased the small size of this as opposed to buying the larger, much more expensive one.  I also don't think this would work well as a dry shampoo.",0
Klorane dry shampoo works very effectively. Nice smell & it rejuvenates the hair--I successfully maintained a blowout for 4 days!,1
"I love the consistency and it really helps to hydrate the skin. My problem, however, is that it broke me out. I have my skin care down to a science after 15 yrs of acne. So when I broke out after 3 yrs of good skin i immediately returned the product. It was wonderful otherwise.",0
Outstanding Hair Shampoo,1
"I use this serum along with the gel moisturizer. I'm 35 so I don't have many wrinkles but nonetheless this serum gives my skin radiance. It also helps with the oiliness of my skin. Description says it's oil free but upon arrival I saw castor oil in the ingredient list and thought ""WTH? "" Well apparently castor oil is really good for oily skin. I love the price, too. Not too much more than drugstore brands. Well worth your money.",1
"Didn't enjoy this, not much of a difference",0
"I've been purchasing this lip butter for years.  I like to switch up my cosmetics pretty often and try new things.  However, there are about 5 or 6 cosmetics that are ""must-haves"" for me.  This is one of them.  I use it daily and love the soft pink shade it gives my lips when worn alone.  But I really adore wearing it over some of my favorite lipsticks.  It's great to tone down shades that are a bit too bright/dark and if I'm wearing a nude lip that is bit too peachy or brown then I apply a bit of this over it to give me the more pink-nude shade that I love.  I have large lips and do not like the look of traditional ""gloss"".  This lip butter gives my lips a beautiful, soft sheen without the gloss.  I love the texture and the longevity. It also works great at keeping my lips moist.  Fantastic product.",1

"Not good.  As good as the rest of their line is, this is just as bad.",0
"This review is for the newer re formulation with the magnetic cap. It smells great! It still has that classic and distinct middle eastern aroma of spice and frankincense. It is not to much incense but a perfectly blended and such a complex fragrance that elvolves throughout the day and lasts... lasts... lasts! I easily fit this into my rotation as wears great in the colder months of northeast US. This is also an easily over sprayable fragrance! Two spritz and that's it, it's that potent.

I wear Creeds as well and that house is more of my go to frangrance since it smashes all other fragrances with random compliments.

But Jubilation XXV belongs on the same shelf. It's as good as it can get!",1
"The product didn't have the lid coming along with. And it looks CHEAP, dirty, without any seal. I guess someone used it before or even it is the fake one. Feel like I were tricked by the seller. Don't know why I bought it from this seller.
*******
NOT RECOMMEND",0
"Word to the wise when using this product it suggests a nickel size amount but I would say to make sure to put a good coat all over the hair and then put it up with a clip so the conditioner doesn't run all down your back and go to waste. Let it stay in about five minutes and rinse lightly. Great stuff, I love it!;)",1
"I have used naked and a number of other brands but this is definitely my favorite illuminizer! It's not dull at all, buildable and goes on nice & smooth! I usually brush it on top of my cheek bone and add just a little on the tip of my nose! Comes in a great size and should last a while. My only wish is that the ingredients were more natural.",1
"BEWARE!!
This product was put in a coach purse and leaked overnight and completely ruined the leather. If it does it to leather what is it doing to your scalp?

Highly suggest NOT BUYING!",0
"brand new as description, love the price!",1
"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

Associated gear: Parker 99R safety razor; Boker Tree Brand straight razor; Escali Badger Hair brush; Proraso Green pre-shave.",1
"I loved the old, thicker Proraso.

Not sure when it changed, but this new formulation is far thinner and less useful for my thick beard.",0
"I've been using this conditioner for a couple of years now and it's great! I do color my hair and am not sure if it really ""protects"" the color, but it leaves my hair feeling soft and smelling great (it has a mild coconut-fruity scent). I also like the thickness of this conditioner.",1
"I've hit that age when my skin is starting to lose elasticity and I'm getting some lines around my eyes and on my neck that just won't go away (yeah, this happens. I know. But I'm going to fight it!). This came recommended to me by a skin aesthetician friend and I really like it. Have used it for a couple of weeks and feel like it's doing some good for my skin. If nothing else, my skin feels smooth and isn't irritated by it (I have sensitive skin).",1
This is a pretty muted purple/pink with an iridescent purple running through it. It has great dimension and the wear time is exceptional - however you will need at least 3 coats for it to be opaque.,1
"I have used this shampoo and conditioner for years. I will say I have always been extremely happy with it until I ordered through this vendor, BEAUTY IT IS. I noticed right away a few things: 1) the consistency of the shampoo and conditioner both were runny, 2) the smell; it had a chemical fragrance that was not normal for this product, 3) my scalp; red, itchy and irritated. This product is amazing, until you order through someone that has altered it to put money in their own pocket. DO NOT ORDER THROUGH THIS VENDOR!!!!!",0
Good product. Leaves hair moisturized and easy to style with dryer. The fragance is not that great but the product fulfills its purpose.,1
"Product itself is fine, it is the aroma that I don't like.",0
A different type than I used in past.  I do not like how it works with my hair.  Makes it feel flat.,0
Best hair product I've used!,1
I love this stuff!!!,1
"Toner is not a regular part of my skincare routine. I use it occasionally especially after wearing heavy makeup or using sunscreen for some extra cleansing. It feels nice going on but doesn't seem to provide any long term benefits. This toner claims to be different. Not only does it relax and refresh, it also has anti aging properties. The ingredient list is impressive. It includes a patented substance called Supplamine which is designed to address inflammation, oxidation and glycation as well as fruit  and floral extracts including arnica and calendula. It can be sprayed directly on clean dry skin  and used as a skin freshener throughout the day.

I must say it is refreshing and my skin feels great after application. Their is a fragrance that doesn't linger. The spray is a terrific way to dispense the product, providing enough but not too much. It is still early to see results but this does seem to soothe and enhance moisturizer absorption. My skin is fairly sensitive and tends to redness and this seems to alleviate the irritation. I have not experienced any negative side effects such as break outs or rashes. It is too early to realize any observable anti-aging benefits but thus far I am pleased with this product.",1
"This is a great product, seems to help reduce fine lines with regular use, however .... no matter how much product is in the cannister, you're not going to get much opportunity for ""regular use"" after a couple of weeks, because the pump will stop working, and the product inside is then inaccessible. Forget about just trying to screw the cap off to shake some out. Not happening. I've bought this item three times in an effort to replace a bottle that stopped working. Same problem all three times. I give up. Won't buy again, unless offered in a tube or other container that doesn't malfunction so that most of the product can't be used.",0
Small for the price but looks so good.,1
It's the only product I've found that keeps my face from drying out. It's not greasy- will wash off your hands with just water,1
Nice color my wife likes how easy it went on.  Not too bright not too plain.  A cool natural tone for every day.,1
"Beautiful color, speedy delivery, and the merchant was very helpful and responsive. I originally received this item defective, it was very tacky and thick, hard to put on. I emailed him, and he sent a replacement immediately, which I also received quickly. Will definitely do business again! TY!!",1
"Not a miracle, but it think it helps",1
"I have tried this three times now and dislike how it makes my hair feel.  It feels like I put in a heavy wax that coats, hardens and keeps me from being able to comb through.  I use it very sparingly, but It is heavy on the ends and I fear that by trying to comb through the snarls it creates I am making more damage;, not less.  I have fine and thin straight hair.  The only way I could use it would be at night to be washed out in the morning and I would do that if I thought it would improved the condition of my hair.  Not something I enjoy using during the day for at work or being out and about",0
"Images clear cell line is truly excellent for clearing up acne. Very effective. Minimal peeling may occur upon beginning use, but peeling will subside, along with clogged pores and acne.",1
I love this product but I only purchased it a few months ago and it shows that its charged but won't turn on anymore. Amazon says its past my return date :(,0
I love the shampoo but only got one pump attachment and these are very large bottles so it is not easy to use in the shower.,1
did not work.,0
"Oribe gold is awesome. My hair dresser recommended I use it since I have very dry hair. You do not need to use alot of it, small amount makes your hair soft. Definitely would purchase again. Little pricey but will last for awhile.",1
This product is amazing! My 16 year old son has been using it on his acne & blackheads & it has done a great job clearing him up!  It works great on me as well!  Very happy with this product & look forward to using other products in the Bioelements line!,1
Yikes,0
"I bought this as a gift only to find out afterwards that it does not work on tanned skin. Seriously, who short of an eskimo or albino doesn't have tanned skin? Additionally you cannot use it if you have been out in the sun for the past two weeks or are planning to go in the sun...so frankly this is great for removing armpit hair or for recluses.

Good Grief.",0
Love that the polish is free of all the crap that's in most polishes. I had  a pedi and the polish has lasted for ever. I used to only use OPI polish but now I'm a London Butter gal.,1
Introduced to this cream after having a facial (at double the price). I find it to be a quality eye cream product....Niacin is supposed to be good for the eye area. NIA is nice.,1
"I love Bliss ex-Glow-sion, and this is a great kit, however, the product was old, discolored and smell had changed. .",0
Terrible product and now I find out it is not eligible for return.,0
"I adore this product! A few sprays is all you need and it fully saturate your hair. I have very thick hair and usually need to use more than what's recommended on the bottle, but it's not the case for this product. Even if I over spray my hair, I don't feel product build-up. My hair is the softest it is ever been before. The smell is okay. I really don't know how to describe it, but after I brush it through my hair the aroma dissipates. It lasts me a long time which is a plus considering the price.",1
Came fairly quick and seems to be the authentic product although the tape wrapped around the pump was rather strange.,1
"I love this L'Occitane product.  I normally buy directly from L'Occitane.  The refill that I purchased from amazon is either a fake or extremely old.  It is goopy and sticky unlike the real stuff from L-Occitane which is smoother and felt more like oil.  Also the bottom of the refill container had a 1 cm layer of white stuff.  I had not noticed until I got towards the end of the container.  Of note, I only bought the amazon refill 2.5 months ago.  The shelf life is much longer than that.
  The smell is different than the real stuff from L'Occitane.  I recently bought a refill from L'Occitane.  Comparing the real L'Occitane with the one from amazon, I can see, feel, and smell a BIG difference.  BTW, there is NO white residue at the bottom of the L'Occitane  refill.  BEWARE!!",0
"I received the iluminage Skin Smoothing Laser for my honest review. I have wanted to look into what is advertised in my city as laser light treatments.  I have reached the age where this is something I think could benefit me.  So with much delight I ordered the iluminage Skin Smoothing Laser hoping for younger looking skin.  Per the description of the iluminage Skin Smoothing Laser it states The skin smoothing laser delivers pulses of laser light below the surface of the skin, where wrinkles form. This technology is known to trigger the body's natural response to generate new collagen fibers. Skin's support structure is reinforced from within-significantly reducing wrinkles. Safe enough to use at home, yet as effective as professional lasers for the treatment of facial wrinkles, such as wrinkles around the eyes and mouth.  I was very excited to try this and read the instruction manual at least six to seven times cover to cover. I had no experience with laser treatments and I wanted to be very safe and sure about using it.  I charged it immediately as the instruction manual stated there would not be a full charge on the laser.  With great anticipation, I used it the next night firmly aware that there may be slight stinging and redness.  I first tried it on my forearm as stated in the instructions.  I had two red welts on my forearm for a full 24 hours.  This did not deter me in any way.  I used the laser, and yes it stings.  I compare it to many, many bee stings.  After a full four zone use (this is the recommendation in the manual) and 40 pulses per zone, my face was intensely red and my skin had welts all over.  The stinging persisted for 25 to 30 minutes.  It was very painful.  I had to take some ibuprofen for the pain.  The next morning I still had redness on both checks.  I used it again that evening, same thing happened, intense stinging and redness and pain.  I took ibuprofen again.  The third night I was getting ready to use the laser and my husband said, I wouldnt use that as your face looks quite puffy!  Now, I have been married for nearly 30 years and I have never heard those words out of my husbands mouth.  Your face looks puffy!  So, I decided, per the manual instructions, that I should skip a night as I have never had any type of laser treatment done and apparently my skin was quite sensitive.  However, this still did not deter me from my quest for younger looking skin.  I have regularly used this laser treatment almost every night for three weeks.  I even took a before picture before I started.  I took an after picture last night and compared the two.  Unfortunately, I see no difference whatsoever.  I specifically wanted to try this laser treatment for my smoker lines on my lips.  I have not smoked in years, but I still have the lines to prove that I did once smoke.  Also, I am beginning to see lines around my nose area and into my forehead at the top of the nose between the eyebrows.  However, the forehead is not a zone and the instruction manual says not to use this laser on any other area but the four zones.  They are underneath the eye and around the cheeks, around the mouth and chin.  I wanted this to work so badly that I proceeded to use it every night with the stinging and pain and yes it does sting and it is painful.  I spent every night I used it with burning and redness.  I did find if I used a moisturizer right after, the redness did not last but the stinging did.  As the nights went by, I did have fewer welts on my face and the redness did not last as long, but I still had intense stinging after use for at least 15 to 20 minutes every night.  So, after three weeks of conscientious use, I see no improvement in the appearance of lines, wrinkles, or skin tone.  I will however, continue to use it hoping that eventually I will see some improvement.  If not, I will stop as I cannot even begin to imagine continuing to use this laser treatment every night, experiencing pain, and no results.  I am hoping to gradually see less lines and wrinkles.  Can I recommend this product?  Not at this point in time.  I will attempt to update if I do experience the results I am truly looking for.",0
Good stuff,1
If you want to keep a beautiful hear! Definitly this is the option. I loove this shampoo. And I recomend the masks too.,1
"I have been  been using only this shampoo for 9 years, it leaves my hair in an amazing condition that creates no fizz, and holds any style.  My hair is super healthy and I am always getting compliments.  My problem is with the last jar that I bought from this vendor.  One jar usually lasts me a year because it is super concentrated in a gel like form.  After a few months, this last jar developed a strange odor and it looks like something is growing on the top of the gel.  In addition, the gel is disintegrating into a sticky, gooey, more liquid consistency.  It's gross and probably really unhealthy!!! I don't know if this was an old product from this vendor, or  a bogus product, or what, but I can tell you, I've asked for a full refund of my $140.00 and have not heard back from them.  I will keep you posted.",0
"This is one of the best spray gel conditioners out there.  I tried Biolage by Matrix spray gel, which is more expensive when bought locally and it is harsh on your hair.

I would honestly prefer putting cold cucumber slices over my eyes. That feels pretty nice and smells nice too.

If I had to find something nice to say about 911, it is odorless and slightly cooling. It's also probable that my baggy eyes are beyond any kind of help; but if I ever find something that does work, I'll update this post. For now, I'll go back to cucumbers.",0
"I sometimes loathe taking off eye makeup and I don't really wear much besides mascara and some concealer. No matter how hard I work, I usually wake up with racoon eyes because the makeup wipes or remover didn't take everything off the night before. I usually prefer cream remover  because at least it's less drying with all the scrubbing. Thankfully, this Vichy remover was fast and not drying like a lot of things can be. I didn't wake up with racoon eyes and a little on a cotton round went a long way. I'd get this again!",1

"Bought this due to all the great reviews. Was not impressed at all. Sits on top of lips, feels sticky, the smell is very very very strong! I felt this was more of a lip gloss than lip moisturizer. I also got the Lemon scent and it's just as strong, except the Lemon smells very sweet (fake sweet). I found the Lemon smelled better than Lavender, which is just stinky! I'm sticking to Caudalie, which is amazing and works wonders for me! Will not be purchasing again.",0
I have thinning edges and this product works well to fill in spots in hair,1
"Excellent product for facial hygiene. when used regularly, helps control acne",1
My skin too sensitive. I can only use this 2x wk,0
"My fault I ordered the wrong one... I didn't realize I ordered the pink color (super floral scent) versus the purple bottle (vanilla, musk, licorice).  Oh well my mother likes it. :)",0
It wasn't all that,0
Great product and good price.,1
"I love the lotions but the shampoo leaves LO s hair lookin greasy and a mess, had to stop using",0
This product is great and keeps my hair hard as a rock.,1
This has a great scent...and just enough sparkle!  I bought several and gave as gifts too...I will reorder when I run out!  This is my go to lotion that I put on when we are going out...it gives your skin just a nice glow.,1
"Happy with the product, good tint and and moisturizer in one.",1
"The packaging states this is for HORMONAL hair growth. So if you have hair growth due to aging, PCOS, or some other similar factor then this is for you. If you have lots of hair because of heredity/ethnicity, this may not work for you and may account for some of the bad reviews of this product.

Here's my take. I have been battling an ever worsening crop of thick, black chin hairs and a dense mustache (thankfully light colored) for several years now. I don't have full blown PCOS, but I have similar symptoms and definite hormonal issues. I can't afford laser and I bought one of those IPL things for home use, but have been scared to use it. I've plucked and shaved for years now and that hair grows back FAST. Crazy fast. Even plucked hairs are back in a couple of days. That's why I don't wax: I would have to do it once a week. I've wanted to buy this cream for a long time but, expecting disappointment, waited months to shell out the cash for it. I did a patch test with the cream and waited a few days because I have very sensitive skin. I had no reaction, so I shaved my chin and started rubbing the Gorilla Warfare in twice a day. ~It worked immediately~ The hair has stopped growing. I'm not exaggerating and I'm not a paid spokesperson... in ONE week, my rampant & disgusting beard (let's call it what it is) has stopped growing! The one, tiny little thing that sucks about it is that I should have WAXED before starting to use this cream because now I have visible black dots in a few spots that aren't growing out for me to pluck! I'm going to stop using the cream and wait for the hair to grow out. Then I will wax and start over with smooth, fresh skin.

The bottom line: Yes, it is expensive and, yes, you have to continue using it to maintain results (a little goes a long way, though!). If your hair problem is hormonal then this might work for you like it did for me and that makes the cream worth so much more than what I paid for it.

Update: It is ten days later and only now my hair has grown back to the point that I made a waxing appointment. It took probably 5 days to start seeing significant regrowth after only a couple of applications. That makes me think that, for some people, you can get away with using this less often to save money and still get some good results. I'll update in a couple of weeks to let you know how things work out post-wax.",1
SAVED MY LIFE,1
it did not work for me at all...it was just waste of money. I have dark spots on my face left over from pregnancy. This product did not help at all to lighten them,0
"What a waste of money, $50.00 spent on another product that doesn't keep it's promises. I've been using this for over 2 weeks & see absolutely no improvement.  Don't waste your time or money on this stuff.",0
This product is great !  I buy it all the time .  There is nothing better on the market.  Unfortunately this one did not have a top so I could not compare and will not be able to use it .,0
A little too sweet and berry for me-,0
Does not help the occasional cystic acne like I had hoped. Better for me to spot treat with some benzoyl peroxide. Camphor smell is strong but not get used to it.,0
"This lip balm is creamy and smooth.  It glides easily onto your lips.  The Berries shade is very, very dark.  Even though this is a lip balm, it covers like a lipstick.  You can use your finger, or a lip brush.  Because this is so dark, I would suggest using a brush to apply it.

If you are looking for a nice, creamy lip balm that works like a lipstick, give this one a try.",1
"This is a really fun treat! Lots of stuff to try and the box itself is cool too. Mostly got it because it comes with a Julep polish, I got white. And the discount off a future order seemed like a great deal. Now I just need to figure out how to get the discount... guessing I'll get an email.  4 stars instead of 5  because it came with 6 fragrance samples and that was a little lame.",1
"I was very excited to order this as I had waited awhile due to the cost. I read a few reviews in magazines but wish I would have read some reviews on here before I purchased. I happened to see some while I was waiting on it's arrival. I didn't know that after a certain amount of time it would stop working. It says that it will work for one person ie a woman on her legs, underarms and bikini area. Then I went on to read that it only works for a certain number of ""zaps"" WELL in reading the manual and understanding the product once in hand it has 5 settings and it works the best on setting 5. Let me just tell you that I birthed 2 children and have a nice size tattoo on my back and I could not stand to use this on setting 5 for more than a few seconds. I'm thinking about returning because if in fact it does stop working after a certian number of times my only option is going to be using it on level 5 all the time instead of using like a level 2 or 3 for a longer period of time!! Good luck",0
The lip liner was damaged,0
ok,1
"Cutting Chair, Inc. shipped the wrong product.  I ordered 6 bottles of Rusk W8Less Shaping and Control Hairspray 8.5 Fl. Oz. Instead they sent 6 bottles of Rusk W8Less Spray Gel 5.3 oz.  An entirely different product.  Apparently, there is no easy way to return these goods for replacement or credit.  Very disappointing!!!",0
I absolutely love this product! I have very oily hair and would have to wash daily prior to purchasing this. It takes all the oiliness out of my hair in between washes so I can go 2-3 days.,1
"Good blades, nice and sharp.  Able to tackle heavy beards",1
Favorite shampoo.,1
"Didn't like that it didn't specify the voltage and watts as it doesn't suit my country, had to buy a transformer for it to work, worked for 20 minutes then it blew out and caused a fuse.
Such a shame because the curls were nice, was really expensive just wish it worked here or specified as I would not have purchased it if known",0
Nice product,1
I like the product it has a nice creamy feel and spreads easily over the face. My only complaint is I feel it is a bit pricy for the size of the packaging.,1
My hair is so thick that it won't fit into the product and so have not been able to use it.,0
MY FAVORITE HAIRSPRAY!  NOT HEAVY. BUT HOLDS THE STYLE AND HAIR LOOKS VERY NATURAL.,1
Haven't noticed any difference in my hair.,0
I just didn't love it enough. So I gave it to my mom.,0
Love it and was cheaper than salon.,1
"Horrible product.  The curlers barely heat up, even after letting it warm up for 30 minutes.",0
Works great on super curly hair!! Very soft.,1
Love this,1
"I usually use the sensitive, but this is so much more softer and gentle on my skin, and still leaves my skin super clean and super soft.",1
"Works great but you have to careful, not as sturdy as other combs",1
Works just as described. Would highly recommend this product.,1
This is a great year round cologne. I highly suggest it,1
"For years I've been dealing with thinning hair.  My daughter was married last year and the hairstylist used this produce on me.....I actually love my hair again.  This product makes my hair look full and thick.  Now when the wind blows, I don't have to worry about thinning spots showing.  LOVE IT.",1
"skyn ICELAND Under-Eye Illuminator works great as intendedbrightening, lightening, and recharging tired skin under the eyes. I am not an expert on skin care products, but can provide some personal background on my own experiences with other products along with skyn ICELAND Illuminator.  Skyn makes no statements about reduction of fine lines common for skin care products used around the eyes.

Growing up in Florida, and having a parent that had sun related melanoma, I have understood the importance of sun screen for years, and routinely use it.  Now in my 50s, I still use Olay Complete (with occasional forays into Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer depending on price), but nothing stops the progression of time, particularly around the eyes.  Factors beyond age, including late nights and stress only exasperate the dark circles and bags under the eyes.

Again, not being a skin care expert, my own estimation of the range of products making claims for reducing under-eye darkness generally fall in to a couple of categories.  Covering agents (including colored pigments, fillers, and reflecting agents), constrictors and tightening agents (various alcohols, witch hazel, astringents), and potentially chemical and mechanical exfoliants (Retin A, retinol, organic acids, alpha-beta hydroxyl acids, peroxides, micro beads and scrubs, laser peels). Covering agents containing typical make-up base (color pigments) and reflecting agents seem most typical for darker skin under the eyes.

I prefer scent free productsor a scent that is very light and disappears quickly. No sticky residues after application is also important.  Application cost must be under control.  So, in addition to daily Olay Complete, my preference for occasional use around the eyes and over time has been limited to another Olay product, Definity, which is now called OLAY EYES ILLUMINATING EYE CREAM.  Like skyn ICELAND, this product has some reflecting pigments which brighten darker skin under the eyes, along with a refreshing hydration agent.

For this review, I thought it would be interesting to compare skyn and Olay directly.  Skyn ICELAND has a wedged applicator tip that you are supposed to run underneath your eye.  Olay is simply dabbed and rubbed.  In actual use, the skyn applicator seems unnecessary and requiring a bit more coordination than simply using a dab on the finger (which also controls the amount a bit better).

Once applied, on clean dry skin, one dab of each, skyn ICELAND and Olay Eyes, under opposite eyes, the masking and illuminating effect is very subtle but visible!  Neither product has any perceivable pigment, relying on the micro-reflecting effect for color reduction.  Skyn ICELAND has a slight advantage in darkness reductionyou cannot expect dramatic effects with either product, but the effect is visible on my skin.  The feeling on the skin after a period of drying is bone dry for the skyn ICELAND, with more cream stickiness for the Olay.  Both products provide a refreshing period during the drying with the skyn ICELAND having the definite advantageit feels more cooling than the OLAY and seems to last slightly longer.  This refreshment lasts only a couple of minutes.  Tired eyes will love it.  There is no perceivable scent or fragrance in either product.

On the first application of skyn ICELAND I applied too much (using the applicator) and probably did not spread it out enough.  After a little while it looked like the edges of application were peeling off.  Less is definitely better.  Olay tends to have a similar effect, if you rub your eyes, over application tends to slough off in tiny little clumps.  Again, less is better!

Money wise, skyn ICELAND costs more per ounce than the Olay Illuminator.  Grocery and drug store availability may be limited.  Olay products are everywhere and while still expensive can be very cost competitive on the shelf with similar products. Since these products are typically applied sparingly and occasionally, cost of application is low so do not let the sticker price deter you from trying?

Overall, I like the skyn ICELAND  Under-Eye Illuminator.  It has advantages over the Olay Illuminating cream including a bit more color reduction, drier feeling after application, and a bit more refreshing feeling with application.  Based on the low cost of application (when dabbing rather than using the applicator tip) it is cost competitive.  If you have never tried these types of products, skyn ICELAND Under-Eye Illuminator should be a product you try. Also, given the opportunity I would try other skyn ICELAND products.",1
"Works well, super powerful pump so be careful not to apply too much!",1
"This is a lovely cleanser that foams up wonderfully. I rarely get any full on ugly nasty pimples because when there is any signs of them, I whip out this trusty cleanser and it significantly reduces the lifespan of the pimple. My pimple sort of shrivels up and die.",1
Best EVER for cracked heels. Period.,1
"I want to like this because I LOVE other Paul Mitchell Awapuhi products, but this one left a greasy residue and did not have the detangling magic of the Paul Mitchell Keratin Cream Rinse. I kept it because I had already used some, but won't buy this one again.",0
Just is not what I wanted.,0
This is the best hair spray - especially for fine hair - holds well but isn't 'hard' or sticky.  Been using it for years but is difficult to find locally since most salons stock only the 'currently popular' and more expensive products.  Why pay big big bucks when this does a better job!,1
so much better than many hand creams and Ahava is difficult to find at local stores.,1
"i love this product, but when i opened this particular bottle it smells like dead fish! i can't find a place to contact the seller and when i tried to report it as defective, they want me to send this one back (at my expense).",0
"I have purchased Laura Geller lip spackle in the past, it was in a round container and it was incredible. This spackle was different,  orange/pink in color, sticky. I returned it.",0
"The single best eyeliner I've ever used.
HOWEVER, it's advertised to last 1 year +. Mine lasts 2 months tops before running out. Given, I wear winged eyeliner daily.",1
"I was really hoping to like this eyelash curler after reading the positive reviews.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be  flimsy and cheap.  It does not open and close smoothly nor does it curl my lashes for longer than a few seconds.  Frankly, it was a waste of money. I do not feel secure putting my lashes in this device.  My old Lancme eyelash curler is far superior in design and quality.",0
Didnt notice any effect. Waste of money.,0
"works really well, worth the money",1
"I have a lot of allergies, but this did not set them off at all. Easy to apply and not visible to the naked eye. We'll see how well it works after I have been using it for a few weeks, but so far I am pleased.",1
"This stuff works! My face feels cleaner, and brighter!! Tone is looking great and I love it, I have only been using it for a week and thinking about ordering another one just to be proactive so I do not run out!!! It does not break me out, and it only takes a small amount to cover the whole face!!!!",1
"Staying with the less-agressive settings for now.
I keep this thing on 1 to 1.5.  Anything else will take your face off unless you know what you're doing.",1
We've had the illuminage for a few weeks now and honestly can't say we are noticing a big difference. Slightly less grew back but in certain areas there is no effect.,0
Does not work for red or blond hair,1
"It may have been great if I hadn't received platinum blonde instead of black. And then tried to exchange it and received the wrong color a second time. After that I gave up, so I'll never know if it works.",0
Got this as a reoccurring gift for someone special. She loves it. Much cheaper than retail.,1
"My very favorite shave cream used with a brush.  Expensive, but just a small amount lathers up the brush very well for a couple of shaving passes.",1
A little overpriced but I like that it does not leave my hair feeling stiff. I also like the pump spray as opposed to a aerosol spray for environmental concerns.,1
"I started using this product about 5 years ago on the recommendation of my Dermatologist.  It is wonderful, breakouts went down significantly, easy to use.  Cheapest place to buy them is here on Amazon that I have found.",1
"I have long hair that reaches halfway down my back. It isn't straight, it isn't curly, but it has just enough wave in it that I have to style my hair to look presentable. When I read that the BIO IONIC Boarshine Brush, Large, 0.4 lb. helps to smooth hair, I was very excited to see how it worked. Having now used it, I am very disappointed.

The brush looks impressive and feels good in the hand. That said, I found it challenging to use as the bristles tend to grab hair easily. This sounds like a good thing, as it holds the hair Im trying to style, but it has a tendency to pick up other hair and then tangle around the brush. This wasted time, hurt my head, and was ultimately frustrating. Not only that, but instead of smoothing my hair, it left it frizzy and a bit unruly.

Perhaps this brush works better for short hair styles than it does long ones.",0
"Much runnier consistency than other hair products I was told to compare this to (namely American Crew Fiber). If you have thin hair I would NOT use this product. While it does hold well at first, the hold doesn't last. It clumps thin hair together to make you look bald and adds unnecessary sheen.",0
"I am SO glad I finally found something that covers up my slightly thinning hair.  This stuff is exactly what I was looking for.  It darkens my scalp so that it looks like my hair is continuous.  I have the dark brown and light brown, and both look pretty good depending on how long my hair is.  My only complaint is that sometimes it clumps up and may fall onto your shirt.  If it does this, especially in sunlight people will start wondering what is in there.  Also, be careful when you put it on....you can easily breathe in the particles.  My lungs hurt the first day I had this and I finally figured out why.",1
Did not work for me..made my face feel greasy.. Powder works best,0
"Good sun block, just has a slight weird smell when applied to the face, but the coverage is good and if I sweat, there is no excessive white film like the Neutrogena brand.",1
"Not a fan of the oily consistency, plus the smell is not pleasant at all. I like the other VICHY spf, thought will try something new, this one is not for me",0
"I expected better from this company! Their hand cream is great but this foot cream stinks, It has a slick, sticky consistency and you must wash it off your hands after applying. That's hard to do if you're lying in bed and your feet are wet from the cream. Use the hand cream instead.",0
"Cleans thoroughly, gently, rinses easily without stripping skin of moisture. I buy large bottles and use them to refill travel sized ones for my sink and gym bag.",1
It was good but one of the shadows broke,0
Get the Eucalyptus one.  Avoid the aloe/vitamin E one.,0
"I purchased this b/c the smoothing serum that I'd used for over 10 years had been discontinued.  After searching and searching, I took a chance with this one.  It is pretty good, but doesn't really compare to the one I had previously.  This smoother is thick, so I have to use more of it on my hair.  I use it for very curly hair to tame the frizz.  And I'll likely purchase it again, unless I can find a better product before hand.  I've also used it when I straighten my hair and it acts the same way.  I still have to use pomade on my hair to control the frizz.",1
My girlfriend didn't like it bc it didn't dry correctly.,0
I use this with the gemstone conditioner. It leaves my hair very shiny and I love knowing that it won't damage any color or processing done to my hair!,1
I used this shampoo and its matching conditioner for a while. My hair never looked or felt better. Why did I stop?  The scent. Theres just something about it I don't care for. Its too bad because its one of the best products out there.,1
"This brand of tanning lotion did not work for me.  The application was easy as all you really have to do is rub it in evenly, but the color was all wrong.  My skin turned out to be too orangy/brown.  It didn't look natural at all. I tried to apply it a second time thinking I had just used too much, but nope it wasn't my application. This lotion just has too much color in it for my skin.  It might look great on darker skin tones, but for med/light ones I would shy away.  The one positive I could find was that this one didn't smell horrible. Several other brands I have chosen smell really bad, but this one does have a nicer fragrance than most.

I have found that self tanners are totally subjective because everyones skin tone is different so this might work for you, just be careful is all I am saying.",0
"I really liked the first bottle I bought so I bought another one. But the second one has been causing me problems: the pump doesn't work correctly so rather than spraying out, it oozes from somewhere and gets all over my hands.. the thing I'm paying to prevent haha..

Also am concerned about all the reviews about it not actually being good for your hair because it just covers it in silicone so it looks pretty but the argan oil part is a bit moot since it doesn't get into your hair.. might as well get any other spray then instead of paying a premium for it being argan oil...",0
"A little goes a long way, but how it ends up is the issue. The feeling is Very greasy and heavy, and my pores looked and felt very clogged with this. It cannot be used alone without looking rather strange. It covers pretty well, which means that you have to add back shading to look like a real person instead of a plastic toy. When you add powder (I used this same brand to try and follow suggested use), it gets rather muddy and cakey, looking very thick.

I took it off after a very short while because of how yucky it felt. I didn't care for this product, but in good news, it does help block sun.",0
Good product,1
good price.,1
"Nice smell, indeed as some reviewers said more masculine than lavender or espresso. Coffee? Not at all. Hands feel smooth after use, but using it since few days regularly and no visible change of dried skin",1
Much better than the cheaper one I previously had. It has a nice weight and balance to it.,1
Great product,1
Used this five times and it just stopped working.  Piece of junk.,0
"I've been duped; the word crme implies cream or a think consistency.  This is fine cornstarch type powder with mica in it.  I get the same benefits using this product as I do using Lavender scented baby powder which costs about $4.00 and has about 300% more product.  So I paid over $25 for a little tiny container of baby powder plus mica, I'm so embarrassed. Worst of all, I can't get it to come out of it's little applicator so I have to shake it onto my hand, like baby powder and work into my roots. And yes, I did take it out and cleared the tube of the powder, but for the price of this product you'd think that the packaging itself would be quality. This is by far the least satisfying online purchase I've ever made Online.",0
"Works good, but don't push it too hard, otherwise it will make your lashes more bent than curled.",1
It didn't work as soon as I got it. It wouldn't spray anything. They didn't give me a full refund and I had to pay for shipping. Even though it was defective and not my fault. It was the worst customer service experience I've ever had.,0
"Too expensive, maybe $15?? Many better scents out there by e&c",0
"a family member has been using this daily for years -- and then was diagnosed with an eyelid infection.  probably had nothing  to  do  with this product, but stopped using it just in case.",0
As a retired stylist for 15 years I have never seen a shampoo for colr treated hair work like this. Increible,1
Gave it 5stars to start but after I noticed label over label on box and after I applied the Cologne and the scent lasted 10 minutes - I am convinced it is a watered down version... MAYBE THE SUPPLIER WILL MAKE GOOD OR ALLOW ME TO RETURN. I AM VERY DISSAPPOINTED AND WILL NOT EVEN BUY FRAGRANCES  FROM AMAZON SUPPLIERS,0
I've been using Jack Black lip balm for years and these must be fake or old. I actually own another one of the same scent and did a blind sniff test with a friend and this one smells pretty terrible. I'm not going to return it because I threw away the box and packaging before smelling these (I assumed they were good since I've used them before). Would not recommend ordering these.,0
"As a HUGE fan of the St Tropez Mousse, was excited to try this product but was lead to disappointment. I applied the product very carefully but it ended up looking splotchy no matter how carefully applied and the smell was pretty strong.

Overall, love the brand because of their mousse and lotions but would not suggest the in-shower gel.",0
Love it,1
2nd Mia last one broken in 2.5 years and I fixed by replace the batteries. Yes. you can replace the battery you youtube it. my wife bought this one $169 but costco selling it for $94.95 as package deal. Miss the return period. it works but it doesn't last long.,0
received and product had leaked everywhere,0
"I love the smell, it leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft!",1
Nice not strong but still good,1
"Works great!  very easy to apply and carry in my purse,  this is perfect for in-between salon visits",1
protect your face!,1
Love the smell and smoothing texture of this product. My only slight disappointment is that it can separate in the container.,1
Didn't do anything for me and I followed the instructions to the T daily during my shower routine. I never saw any color and wasted a lot of time standing around in the shower. I tan very easily too. Was highly disappointed in this product and do not recommend.,0
"The smell is not great. I also noticed that I lost a lot of hair in the shower as I was washing off the shampoo. My hair feels squeaky clean to the point where it dries out because the shampoo has taken off all the natural oils and my hair over compensates by making more oil to the point where after a few hours, my hair is already starting to look oily.",0
"Dont waste money on the brand,buy a cheaper kind and still get the same results. I thought this brand would be thicker and more hair like,but this is powdery like the rest.",0
"I purchased this product after reading the long and raving review in Amazon, it does not do what it says it does. I went back to Neutrogena Visibly Firm night cream
and since ones again I am getting wonderful compliments on my face, the downfall of Neutrogena is the price, but it is worth every penny.",0
It was the right product that got sent to me and I also received it very quickly. I was really pleased!,1
Good stuff! Price went up from $12 though,1
"Works wonderfully, love the body it gives my hair!!! Very satisfied with my purchase , definitely worth the money, great product!!",1
"First Babyliss products and I am sorely disappointed.

The larger barrel does not mean larger curls. I have had no problem creating curls in my long hair with any other iron I have ever used except this one. The curls just don't hold. Also, it is extremely difficult to use this iron because the gray plastic tip gets way too hot to handle, and it's so stubby, you can't hold onto it for stability with one hand while you to roll your hair in the iron in the other. Lots of burned fingers.

I guess you could buy one of those gloves in order to use this, but that shouldn't be something you HAVE to do to use any curling iron. Gave it a chance, but will be buying something else to replace it soon. I wish I could give it away so I'm not too wasteful but I don't want to subject anyone else to the poor design!",0
"Its not actually OPI. When I put it on, it wasn't as smooth as nail polish should be but applying it slowly and with a good amount of polish I got it on there without any mess ups. Ive had the paint on my toes for about a week now. Ive had no chipping but I used good quality base and top coat. The color is gorgeous but its not actually OPI",1
"The spraying seems poorly constructed, 2 of the 3 are broken after only a couple uses each.
Very disappointed for travel use",0
"If you have never tried this product, your best bet would be to go to where they sell it and try it first and compare colors.  I ordered the medium.  It is too light and VERY YELLOW.  I should have listened to the other reviewers that stated this. I got the BB#7. The color tone is actually quite ridiculously yellow.  I don't see that many people out in the world that have yellow skin so I am dumbfounded at how this wears.  After applying too much with first application, I went to website and watched application video.  I needed about 25% of what I applied.  I like the dried finish of the product, just not the color.  This is way too expensive to find that out after I have opened it and used it.  I will probably try and mix it in with my usual Boots No 7 Beautifully Matte in the winter when my skin is paler, so I'm not out the entire 50 bucks.",0
"I'm a male with very thick, dark hair, that has a slight wave, that I style into a messy-ish quiff/pompadour, think Nick Wooster meets Robert Pattinson. I've tried tons of products and this is one that definitely stands out. It's very sticky, which is good for hold, it smells nice, it has a slight shine which really is only there to provide better separation and texture. I almost always have to cocktail a couple of products together, this works well on it's own, but for me I almost HAVE to cocktail products. I'm currently cocktailing this with the Mitch Reformer, and they work very well together.
Overall, this is a great product for guys who need a lot of hold and texture, some separation and a mostly -but not completely- matte finish.
I'd definitely recommend this.",1
Works good if hair loss is minimal,1
Love it! !,1
"According to the vlog world, this is one of the more preferred razors and I see why. I gives you a close shave without tearing your neck to pieces. I have been recommending this to all of my friends who are beginning to get into wet safety razor shaving.",1
"I love this shadow. It's pale and soft great to hold eyeliner in place, oh and no glitter. I will continue to buy this make and shade.",1
This works amazing. I have a cowlick on the back of my head that I can never cover up no matter how much I tease my hair and this covered it up instantly. I will definitely be buying another one.,1
"I had never seen this product in person before buying. I searched online for as a many on-nail swatches I could find. The, 'on the nail' color that is shown by the seller looks nothing like it does when applied on an actual nail. I thought I would be getting a medium smoky rose brown neutral color. In reality this polish color is a medium yellow-based brown sand. There are not any pink hues. You know when you visit a friend's house and their florescent lights shine roughly against a wall color they so adorably call 'warm mocha', but all you can see is a harsh yellow brown? That's exactly what this nail polish color is.. It's pretty icky and should be left in the 70's. Try in person before you buy online.. I've taken a gamble on many nail polishes in the past, some were great some were not. This is the first time I've actually been bothered enough to write a review because this color has been so inaccurately represented. The seller did provide excellent service and quick shipping which is why I rated 2 stars.",0
Great curling iron. Love that barrels can be interchanged!,1
"Unfortunately I ordered 3 of these because I was drawn in by the low price. Big mistake. It's hard to describe the smell but it is VERY strong and kind of like dish soap. Someone's idea of clean and fresh but not mine. I was thinking it might be similar to Philosophy's Pure Grace but Nooooooo.
Unless you really like dish soap/floor cleaner smell I would skip this one.",0
Best price ever!,1
"I first used this with loose powder foundation, and it was ok-- but the distribution could have been better. Pressed powder usually came out cakey so I decided to try this with liquid. BINGO! Application in tight, small circles with my liquid foundation gave absolutely wonderful coverage- easy to apply, it was even, and builds well.

The bristles are densely packed but VERY soft. I've had luck washing it with Tea Tree cleanser from Trader Joe's, I've had no falling bristles or change in how the brush performs.",1
Great product.,1
The smell was too mild for the price.,0
"Great seller, I have used this product for years.  Very effective with helping to blow out frizz!",1
"Lifesaver for places with hard water like Phoenix.  Use with Malibu C weekly demineralizer, it's the best.",1
Not as strong as expected.,0
Feels very soft but holds hair.,1
It's the best!,1
Works great with the hair Perfecting Tool kit!,1
"This may work for some, but it didn't work for me (I have thick blond hair).  I didn't notice any difference.",0
"Out of all my hot tools products this is probably my least favorite, but I still use it a lot! If you are going for a subtle wave this is a great curling iron.",1
the best hair dryer I've ever used.,1
As described,1
"Just wow.  I am not a beauty queen but I must say this is a huge improvement over my old curling iron.  I have it set about half way up on heat and do not leave it in more than five seconds and each section comes out beautifully curled (i do select very small sections of hair as i have so much of it).  I have never burnt my finger tips holding the end as some reviewers have complained - plenty of plastic to grab on to and it has a hallow center that you can stick a finger in to guide the hair around the iron (I could not see that from the picture).  I have a LOT of medium coarse hair and I actually find it FUN to use this tool - even more than my heated rollers!!!  I don't know how one could burn their hair with this if they simply touched a finger to the rolled up hair, felt it was warm and released it.",1
"I had high hopes for this product. Sadly this had the opposite effect on my hair and left me with dryer hair than before. Noticeable breakage started after week 3. Small amount went a long way, but proteins in this product can leave your hair brittle. I would recommend researching your hair type before using  these treatments.",0
Tried this product to cover red lines on face.  Although the immediate results were good . . . that was a short term fix.  The results were far from satisfactory over the long (and short) term.  I would not recommend this product to anybody at any time.,0
Has really kept my hair from becoming damaged from my curling iron,1
This product works exactly as it says it does.  I've tried others but none work like this does.  I used the individual ones when I travel and I buy the jars of pads for home use.,1
"This is a very sturdy dryer and I'm sure would be good for a professional, but for me doing my own hair it is very heavy and unweildy.  And I wasn't able to maneuver the buttons with just one hand.  It may be a very good dryer but for me was just too hard to use myself so I had to send it back.",0
"My hair is dark brown but the dark brown fibers are just a little more darker almost black. I have used this on the top of my head and noone notices except people im around all the time like my wife said it looks thick! An darker because its thicker, but looks natural. I told one person at work, first asking if he noticed anything and he said new clothes? What? I said look at my hair. He said what? It is thicker and look at these pictures on my phone. Before and after. He said it looks great! I have receding hairline and cant do anything about that but my hair is a little thin on top. I put this on and i look younger( im 27) and healthier with thicker dark hair on top unnoticeable if you can do it right. Wonderful i think in my opinion.",1
"Smells good, didn't see much of a difference.  Tried it for a month, maybe if it were longer some changes would ve been made.",0
Does not work for the price.  It also came damaged and you can find less expensive same quality with a different brand,0
"Do not like the entire line.  Had to return.  Tried 4-5 of their products.  Anthellios, which I have been using for 20 years is a much better product.  Had read about this.  Just press hype.",0
"This stuff is amazing! I bought the face wash to go with it. I read some reviews that claimed to have IMMEDIATE after their first time applying this stuff. I didn't experience that. It does take a couple days for your body to respond to this product. I've been using it a week and now I get clear skin over night which is wonderful. I apply this after washing my face. I don't leave it on overnight because when I did that, it dried out my face something terrible. After I apply the mask and wash it off with warm water only, I pat my face dry and waited 10 minutes before applying moisturizer. ALWAYS use moisturizer even if your face is oily. This will prevent further dry skin from the product.",1
Excellent,1
holds great,1
"This product absorbs moisture and is helpful for no shower days.  However it
is imprecise to apply and on dark hair looks like dandruff.",0
"I wanted something black but not so dull, so I chose Gobsmacked.
When it came, I tried it on IMMEDIATELY! It takes 2 or 3 coats to be not as transparent, but it looks clean and matte. It doesn't have as much sparkle as you would hope for, and it isn't anywhere near black, but it definitely looks great and it dries almost instantly. The only bad things I have to say are: It's not black-ish (like the picture showed), and the brush bristles clump up too much, but maybe it's just the glitter.",1
The lipstain was a totally different color than the one advertised. I would only buy this product online I'd you knew what kind you liked beforehand.,0
"This is a very expensive product and i think there was no quality check? It is so difficult to squeeze out the cream. Then one day, the cream just squeezed out from the bottom. So now i can't use it by opening the top. I need to get the cream through the bottom. How odd! There's a cap but serves no purpose. The designer of this container didn't try it themselves and didn't do quality check. I should have my money back! I should even rate it with 0 stars. What's the cream if the container doesn't serve its purpose?",0
"I bought this purely based on the reviews here. I absolutely don't like the perfume. It smells like facial talcum powder. My husband did not like it a bit either. What is even worse is my 2+ year old daughter made faces, and asked me not to come near her. The smell gave me a slight headache, and bad sinus. No, this is not the one to be bought without trying.",0
"I've used Toppik Auburn Fibers for years and have been very happy with it.  However, now they've changed the color and the Auburn is more like a muddy brown than Auburn.  I tried to phone customer service and got a person in Utah who had no clue and kept apologizing to me.  The bottle seems to be made somewhere new too, because it has Auburn/Roux/Rojo on it, rather than the old bottles that just had Auburn on the label.  So best to go to a beauty supply where you can inquire about the product.",0
Far more expensive than Toppik.com.  Not happy at all. I will not send back because it would cost too much.,0
Does the job well but keeps wanting to slide off my Bayliss blowdryer...it's kind of annoying.,1
"Not long wear but nice color, I wanted something I didn't have to re-aply all day kinda dissapointing and I won't buy again.",0
"The smell is intoxicating. I've always enjoyed showering, but now I really look forward to it.",1
Not a pleasant scent,0
"Great stuff, light, u don't need much- spreads well. Smells very light, not fragrant. 4 stars because i wish it came in a tube or pump rather than open container. Its not a sanitary way to package facial products.",1
"So very disappointed. I used the iron ONE TIME and it worked. It created beautiful, loose curls on par with what I've had done in a salon. I went to use it this morning - only my second use since I pulled it out of the box - and it simply does not heat up. I'd read several reviews indicating this had been a problem, but I ordered it anyway, hoping I would be lucky and not get a defective product. No luck. Clearly, there are manufacturing or design quality issues that the company needs to fix. I have a cheaper Conair 1.5"" iron for, literally, almost 10 years and it still works like day 1.",0
"I love it, except that it has no protective case. It's glass! Get one with a case, it'll last longer.",0
I found this product in mall and it smell good. but it was too costly in the mall and a friend of mine asked me to buy it online to get it cheaper. Now am realizing cheap things are not always good. It is just like water. very very diluted.,0
"I bought this at the dermatology clinic and tried it for 8 weeks ......nothing changed nothing Im 55 and my neck looks the same, very disappointing! It is good as a moisturizer and thats it.",0
I didn't care for this at all. It left my hair feeling heavy and dirty. Very pricey too.,0
"The bottle that claims to be perfume smells a lot like the Jimmy Choo eau de toilette. Unfortunately, I opened the package and used it before I realized it didn't smell like the real thing.",0
"I love this shampoo, but I am very disappointed with my purchase. It arrived half empty because the lid was wide open in the shipping envelope. I cannot find a way to contact the seller. For the steep price I expected better shipping methods and more care with the product.",0
"A little on the heavy side but gets hot and dries hair quickly, Nozzle falls off sometimes which is annoying and the button for the temp control keeps getting hit turning it down when you don't want to. Otherwise love it, had it for a month now",1
"I have relatively thin hair. I use a 1"" curling iron and then have to pull the curls out because I just want a big wavy curl. This item does not do that. It does not curl my hair or straighten my hair. It almost looks like my hair is damaged after I use it. Unfortunately, I threw the box out so I cannot return it.",0
"I love the smell. It feels so soothing on the skin. Not ideal for toning after cleansing, as it is mostly water, but you get a lot of product for very little money, and it feels lovely on my skin.",1
"I wanted to like this, but it is leaking from the bottom where you click it up :(",0
It was the wrong perfume in right bottle.,0
Just get in the sun...,0
"Unless you have absolutely no wrinkles or fine lines I wouldn't buy this. The foundation is great, but the concealer settles in lines terribly and make them look worse then they actually even are.  I'm only 28 and still have youthful skin but this made me look old.",0
Not good!,0
Good price but bottle was damaged when it arrived.,1
"I have been using this product for about 2 yrs but just recently found it here, after many years of slowly losing my hair to the point where I could np longer hide my scalp due to severe thyroid problem I found RF 80. After three months I notice that my hair was growing I will continue to lose hair but not like I use too and also part of the thyroid you can also lose your eyebrows I have eyebrowns again. I hope I never have to go without this product .
Thank you,
mv",1
Good,1
"I've had a clarisonic for almost a decade.  Dropped my last one, one too many times.  The charge wouldn't stay for longer than a week.  Glad to have replaced it with this one.",1
The perfume is not the real thing.  No one can smell it on me after I spray it on.  I am very disappointed that I spent this much money for no fragrance.,0
Did not like at all.  Make my hair hard to brush and blow dry through.  I love matrix products however I did not find this to be good for volumizing.,0
Makes my baby's skin super soft and love the smell too.,1
If you put even a tiny little of this on your face it will look like you caked fake tan on your face and your face will be super shiny. you have to use a TEENY little bit for highlights.,0
Great product!,1
"it ripped my eyelashes .  I have sparce eyelashes somewhat curved, I was looking forward to using something more natural than Mascara which also makes my eyelashes fall out. Disappointed , waste of $.",0
"This stuff is legit. Definitely takes out some of the brass the longer you leave it the better it works. Just beware of it turning your hair violet on the lighter areas. Only bad part is, it stains your hands ",1
It's so good.  Lasts at least a year if used 3-4 times a week. Need very little to build up a rich lather.,1
"Although the texture is silky smooth and the color is good, the coverage is so sheer that multiple layers are need.  Even setting it with powder, it will come off if touched during the day.  Too bad because I liked the other Jane Iredale products I ordered.",0
Great product...really helps maintain hair color. You can truly see the difference in your color when you use it.  It really helps with fading.  You will love this product if you color your hair...,1
"Love the Matrix HydraSource Conditioner, however this is not it. I originally fell in love with the Cooling Mint type and decided to try this one, however, was disappointed with the quality comparison. The Mint was thicker and I didn't need to use as much. After reading some reviews of people suggesting they changed the formula or filled these bottles w something else completely, I went to my local Matrix salon and bought this product... its great! Will no longer be ordering my beauty/hair products off of amazon for fear of getting knock offs.",0
The color of the product is not as dark brown as the ones I used in the past. I am not quite sure it is genuine product actually.,0
Way to strong fragrance,0
"Per the wife:  I don't have acne. I am 55 years old.  But I do have large pores and I am always looking for products that will help reduce the size.  Plus I have oily skin. I love this mask. I wear heavy makeup during the day, and this mask takes it all off.  When I use a toner after using this mask, there is no makeup left on my face.  It also has a very pleasant scent. I like to put it on in the bathtub after I wash my face, let it dry and then wash it off. It feels very luxurious and does a great job. It reduced my pore size. My skin is tight the next morning and looks great.  The product size is large so you get a lot out of the container.  Overall, highly recommended.",1
This was a misleading discription; it absolutly does not fit my Babyliss blowdryer; now i need to return it; please make an adjustment so other customers do not get the same issue.,0
Compared to Hollywood transformation face creme it doesn't measure up at all. I would like to return it for full credit.,0
leaves my hair too limp,0
"The colors of these lip glosses are nowhere close to what's pictured either here on Amazon or The Balm's website. I bought three of these glosses and not one is the color I expected. However, they are not heavy or too sticky, and the smell is pleasant without being overwhelming. Kind of a mild vanilla. Just don't expect to receive the color you thought you were ordering!!",0
It was advertised that it works on veneers  it didn't whiten at all.  I was very disappointed. I used it as suggested,0
"Only gripe is that these can leave a almost soapy like residue, but at least it smells great.",1
"This is a great mascara if you buy your mascara from a department store as I do.
What I love about it-
* The brush is fantastic.  There is a little ball on the end which really gets into the corners of your eyes and makes it so much easier to get a light coat on the bottom of your lashes.
* The price is literally the same as I pay for mine at Belk.
* The product comes off seamlessly with a makeup wipe.  Mine usually takes 1/2 a wipe to get it off cleanly.
The only drawback with this mascara was that it took 4 coats to do the job that mine does in 3.  Overall a great product.",1
It really hrpls to dry exisiting pimples and also to prevent futures one. It dries the sking a little bit just use a good moisterizer..,1
Happy with this razor. Wish I would have purchased a heavier razor.,1
"The product has a very nice, clean scent, and worked well...but I offer there is a minor issue with the packaging. The pump on the bottle is too small, and I had to pump it repeatedly to get an amount in my hand large enough to be useful.

In the end, I took the pump out and put a cap on the bottle.",1
"Great product. Saw results after two weeks. Skin is radiant and even. Plus, it's cruelty free!",1
"Couldn't detect much akin to roses in this scent, disappointedly.  Not a fragrance I would purchase again.",0
"what I liked most....hmmn  NOTHING
did nothing for my eye area.  better results with olay (cheap)",0
"Love it, no complaints.",1
I am usually oily and have blemishes and occasional breakouts. This did not really help they way I thought it would at all.,0
"This is a good medium coverage concealer.  If youve got some minor imperfections, moderate redness or mild to moderate discoloration this will do the trick, but if you're looking to cover any significant scarring or pigmentation issues youll need something heavier.

This formula is very easy to work with  its creamy and easy to blend.  Just dab a *tiny* amount on the area you want to cover then gently tap it in with your finger or a concealer brush.  Ive been able to use this on the under eye area and as long as I apply it sparingly it doesnt emphasize the fine lines and wrinkles.  I generally shy away from concealers for everyday use as they tend to look unnatural, but I really like this formulation  a definite Thumbs Up!",1
DOES NOT STRENGTHEN THE NAIL AT ALLLL JUST ACTS LIKE A THIN NAIL POLISH THAT COVERS YOUR NAIL,0

It's good!,1
"Small, small, and did I mention small jar?!",0

Great product.  Fast service,1
"keeps my hair lookin goooooooooood. get it for the hair, use it for the ladies. make em say UGHHHHH NA NA NA NAAAaaaaaaaa!",1
"Yeah, I guess this is primarily a feminine product, but I'm an 84 yea4 old guy and I find that this wonders for camouflauging my wrinkles/  The color is right on my old skin, neither too dark nor too light.  What's more, it leaves my face feeling refreshed.  So you old guys like me will find this a very good creme to be used on your face.",1
"This product seems to be lightening the hyperpigmentation (sun damage spots) on my chest...brightening it a little, however, it made my face break out horribly in blackheads.  It has an appealing scent, fine mist, overall a great product.  Just be cautious if you're acne prone on your face.",1
Such a perfect facial moisturizer. I have repurchased this so many times and will continue to do so. It is such a soft consistency and never makes my face feel sticky or oily. I don't know how else to describe it other than it feels soft and velvety.,1
"I've had this dryer for two or three years and I love it. I have chin-length fine yet thick hair, and my hair dries in 10 minutes, tops. Love the speed adjustments and the ""warm"" setting. Heard an odd pop this morning and smelled something burning, The hair dryer is still working, though.

Was thinking I would automatically order a new one, but some of these reviews are scary. I use it daily and it's been wonderful, but 2-3 years is a short life span. (My old Sasson dryers lasted a good 10 years, but they don;t make 'em like they used to anymore).",1
just ok,0
"I thought this would work and wanted to try it for at least 6 weeks before writing a review. I took before and after pictures to compare. Unfortunately, it made my nails worse. I generally keep my nails short and wash my hands very frequently, so my nails are weak. I thought this would be a lifesaver, but it just looked messy when you would layer more over every other day, and the corners would snag my hair, eventually chipping off. I think I'm going to try a natural remedy which is soaking nails in olive oil for 10-15 minutes a day. Maybe that will be more successful : (",0
L'Occitane Shea Butter Foot Cream Shipped in a bag. It broke. L'Occitane Shea Butter Foot Cream Everywhere.,0
"I had never seen this product in person before buying. I searched online for as a many on-nail swatches I could find. The, 'on the nail' color that is shown by the seller looks nothing like it does when applied on an actual nail. I thought I would be getting a medium smoky rose brown neutral color. In reality this polish color is a medium yellow-based brown sand. There are not any pink hues. You know when you visit a friend's house and their florescent lights shine roughly against a wall color they so adorably call 'warm mocha', but all you can see is a harsh yellow brown? That's exactly what this nail polish color is.. It's pretty icky and should be left in the 70's. Try in person before you buy online.. I've taken a gamble on many nail polishes in the past, some were great some were not. This is the first time I've actually been bothered enough to write a review because this color has been so inaccurately represented. The seller did provide excellent service and quick shipping which is why I rated 2 stars.",0
"This product really seems to work especially if you have treated hair, I have purchased twice.",1
Not a huge fan. My hair felt somewhat dried out after using and didn't have its usual shine.,0
"Just comes off fast like all other products, except Mac jel eye liner. Lancome old waterproof mascara also great, but i can't find it any more. So hard to find color that can stay on oily skin.",0
I never write reviews but this is SO not worth the money. Save it and buy something else!,0
"I think I'll have to keep working with it. It doesn't curl. It goes all the way to 450 and I couldn't get it to curl my hair, my mannequin or my friend. We are natural. She is 4a and I am 4c. Maybe it's fake....I feel awful. From now on, I will only buy certain things direct from the manufacturer.",0
"Didn't work for me, complete waste of money",0
I don't recommend this item.  Abulta mucho el cabello.,0
"Fits my foreo, longer cord than the one it came with so that's cool. Solid, but much too expensive for a charger.",1
"The flatiron stopped working after less than 6 months of use. I plugged it in a few days ago, and tried to turn the temperature up. It started flashing within seconds and the temperature reading dropped from 390 to 105 degrees, without ever warming up. This is pretty terrible - my previous Chi flatiron lasted 5 years! I'd give the product no stars if possible but I'm not permitted that option. Please do NOT buy - go with another option!",0
One of the best shampoos I have ever used.  Clean smell and does a great job on my hair.  Highly recommend it.,1
"This cleanser did what I needed it to do.  It helped to settle my skin down after several days of use.  I don't  think I  like it for every single day because my skin begins to feel -- don't know how to say any other way -- my skin begins to feel ""heavy"" as though I need to use a clarifying wash.  I would still recommend it to someone who has intolerant/sensitive skin.  It's not a miracle, but it seems helpful.",1
"I love it because it spreads smoothy and makes you feel like you've done something wonderful for your skin, but in reality and truthfully, I am 61 yrs old, no work and need a real facelift. So at this point nothing really will change,, but good luck or the young!!!",1
"This stuff barely came out of the bottle. It was clogged after two uses. In trying to clean it, the top fell off. Not to mention, the spray was thick, sat on the face, and looked white. Never again.",0
"Another great lip product. Nothing works as well as this one to hydrate and smooth.  Not my first round, nor my last.  Glad to find it here!",1
I love this. My mom who is Korean loves it. I have not found a better foaming cleanser. Was using Kheils but this is softer. I love all their products. They recently discontinued their fantastic loose face powder at Sephora. I hope this doesnt mean they are going away or I will have a tantrum.,1
I was expecting to see results with this product after reading all the hype.. Very disappointed. Waste of money indeed.,0
"I'm of two minds about this product- I really like the matte (peach) but I'm less enthusiastic about the dewy (pink) side.

The matte side I have been using on the areas next to my nose, where I have large pores and roseacea. It blurs the pores nicely, but barely has enough tint to deal with some of the roseacea. It goes on smooth and silky, and almost instantly feels dry. I like that, having very oily skin in that area. It doesn't last all day, but it has a nice compact and is easy enough to deal with in the middle of the day. I've used it on clean skin and also over oil free sunscreen; it doesn't seem to matter. It works fine either way. I have not tried it over makeup yet but I think it should work fine, because the foundation I use is also oil free (silicon base like the sunscreen).

The dewy side I've used on my cheekbones and above my eyes and I have to be really careful not to use too much, because it stays a little sticky if I use even a hair too much, and that drives me batty. Used very sparingly, though, it creates a nice, fresh, look.

Neither side has made me break out, and I break out if I put anything remotely oily on my skin.

I think this is a really nice product if you have break through in oily areas of your skin, because it's easy to carry and super easy to apply.",1
"Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo Foundation contains SPF 25 Titanium Dioxide Sunscreen

Be sure to read the 'How to Find Your Shade' section.  It's informative & helpful.

First off, I'm a senior citizen who doesn't have many wrinkles.  This foundation is easy to apply & covers my light colored freckles & my blue/green veins.  My skin looks smoother & a bit younger. I didn't receive their setting powder to review so I'm not sure how applying it would affect the overall look and how long it will wear.  This foundation is not drying &  doesn't cause any irritation.",1
"I received the right product, but this iron has completely fried my hair. I'm  assuming the iron itself is the titanium part,  which I thought made it cool and special and better, but I never realize the importance of ceramic! Every ceramic flat iron I've ever had has never hurt my hair. This iron completely fried it. I have the worst frizzy hair/split ends where I've used it (and I've never ever had frizzy hair!).  I'm sure there is user error involved, but I've use a flat iron for years and years and I've never had this happen. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you're a professional!  It's going in the trash which is sad because it was expensive!",0
"So far so good. Works well, minimal noise.",1
"Only reason I did not give a full 5 stars, which could have to do with my eyes being sensitive, but my eyes get pretty red later on in the day and will dry out (possibly a little more with this) but works AMAZING!!!",1
I really don't like the cream. You can feel it working on your skin. It also kinda clogs the razor if too thick. It will however whip up into a big later and I know its popular in Italy. To each his own.,0
It's not a lip gloss it's a lipstick.,0
love it .,1
"I bought the 1.7 oz. jar for my wife in November 2015 for $56.02. I thought that was outrageously overpriced, but my wife swears by the product. Now, at my wife's request, I came back to reorder -- except it is now $128.00.
Repeat: $128.00!!!
This is beyond outrageous.
It is outright price-gouging.

Doubtful of authenticity think it's fake,0
I love the product,1
"I use this cleanser for a long time, since I have acne prone skin, and it almost solves my problem at all, and gets my skin a lot less oily.
It was recommended to me by my dermatologist.
I usually wash my face twice a day: one time in the morning and one time before going to bed.
It lasts around 4 months if you use it twice a day.
Totally recommend it!",1
"I like these pads but it drys out very quickly and if you are not working fast enough, you will have to open another packet to finish removing the polish from the rest of your nails. Otherwise they are nice and do not have an abrasive smell as other nail polish remover wipes do.",1
Nice product. Not heavy. Got free on pinch me,1
Received this as a sample from Ulta and found it much cheaper through Amazon. I adore this stuff. Leaves my curls soft and defined. I do use it under my TIGI Curls Rock Cream and they work great together.,1
"Not the beat I have tried and not the worst. It's works ( on me ) like proactive, after you have been on it for awhile and it's not working as well as when you started. The best I have tried is Serious Skin Care's adult kit. I get it from hsn. But their Matte moisturizer is very good.",1
Smells Like plastic.  Seems to be fake or expired product,0
Smells great....but still not strong enough for my dry as heck feet...still looking..may never find smthg strong enough....,1

"I am happy to have found this product.  My hair is more soft, has more volume/body, and significantly less drying and damage since I started using Potion 9.  Other product cause my hair to break off and the last inch or so to be brittle and difficult to style.  Sebastian Products all seem to be superior in performance and quality.",1
this product gets a coveted 5-star rating. Those were looking for hair on a bald head should look elsewhere though. You must have some hair in order for this to give the appearance of a thicker head of hair. I have very fine hair and you can see my scalp through my hair. This product does an incredible job of covering that.it is very easy to apply and I strongly recommend you get the sprayer attachment.if you have very thin hair this is definitely the product for you,1
I really wanted to like this product. It smells just lovely and is such a nice change from the usual baby products out there. Sadly it dried out my toddler's sensitive skin and scalp. We use it to make the bath bubbly now. Oh wells.,0
"Too small for my needs, considering the price.",0
"It doesn't cool you down much, if at all, and it's expensive for a product that doesn't do what it's supposed to.",0
"I was offered this product free of charge in exchange for my honest review. The liner I am reviewing is the RICH BROWN.
The liner goes on very smooth, more like a soft, pen liner, than 1 pencil liner. It was creamy, yet still gave a nice, even line. With the added extra of a built in smudge tip on the opposite end, I was able to get a smoky look when I wanted to , or just blend it in for the right amount of color. I found it to only smear a tiny bit, but the smudge tip was able to even that out. It lasted all day at work without getting messy and removal was easy with oil free eye makeup remover. As for the color itself, it is a very dark brown shade, which is nice even with black mascara. Very good liner. I would use again,",1
It is a curling iron that will not leave a crease,1
"I somehow thought it would make my skin look super glowy and it does its job but i think maybe my skin tone and this highlighter don't get along too well, but overall I think this is a good highlighter!",1
"I've been impressed with some of the Juice Beauty products, so I was interested in trying their instant eye life.  My undereye area tends towards dark circles and slight bagginess, and this product promised to firm and brighten.

Now, I knew some of the claims were ridiculous.  Rubbing stem cells from plants on your face does absolutely nothing.  I don't know why they're trying to claim that as a selling point.  But some of the other ingredients are good, and topical patches are proven to temporarily help with the undereye area.

I was underwhelmed.  The first time I used this product, it left my face very sticky.  The second time, I let the patches soak in the activator less, which worked better.  But I really didn't see any difference.  Plus, you're supposed to buy a second product (and eye cream) to use after this one.  (The package does include a small sample.)  The best part was playing with the patches as I put them on and pulled them off.  They have a delightfully gummy texture.

This package includes six uses.  I like that Juice Beauty is organic, but I was very turned off by the packaging of this product.  It is very wasteful and mostly non-recyclable.  Not impressive for people interested in the environment.",0
"The curling iron was exactly what I wanted, however just as a few days ago, the tip melted right off and burnt the hair right off of the scalp. Unfortunately, Amazon says I'm past my return policy. I've used these curling irons for years, never come across a defective one before.",0
Did not fit and melted.,0
"This fit my hair dryer, however the blue metal insert part was not attached.  I got a free replacement, however, the metal part came unattached again within a couple uses.  Worked well the couple times that it was assembled.",0
This was a gift for my girlfriend who love this fragrance.  She mentions often how happy she is to use these products.,1
Purchased this product on Oct of 17 about 4 months ago. The cord split open not sure why. It does not get hot like it should.  I have had this exact one before and lasted this last one not the same!  Not made like it use to.,0
I just can say that Is awesome!!,1
"crap with 3 months of use only this weekends, my short hair, even using only weekends broken !!",0
"excess product all over closure... does not really absorb into lips. wanted to like this very badly, as it's cheaper than benetint, but this gets a huge NO from me.",0
"Great formula, nice and even color that wears well.  I'm not super crazy about the color because it looks a bit weird on my skin tone which is the only reason I took 1 star off. I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere and don't have access to many Opi polishes. While I tried to research swatches via the Internet of this color before I got it, the images never match up to what you see in person.  Still like the color just not lovin it.",1
"These curlers are so worth the price!  They take up very little room and are
So easy to travel and. Keep clean!",1
I like it but I don't understand the hype.,1
"I just wasn't seeing the shine in my hair like I did in some of those around me.  My hairdresser got some of this for me and now I use it every time I wash my hair, whether I blow or air dry it.  I never have any white flakes and my hair is still soft to the touch. Since I use such a gentle shampoo on my hair, it usually takes two washes to get my hair clean.",1
"I loved it until 10 months later, when for absolutely no reason, it stopped working.  The light goes on but no heat comes out.  For the price, it should certainly work for longer than 10 months.  The only option is to send it back (at my cost plus $3.00) and hope they will replace it.",0
"Wasn't what I expected.  After use not very thrilled.  Would not purchase again for my personal use, just don't feel it does anything to enhance shaving. quality, in fact it less satisfying then the gel foam I normally use.",0
Never worked for me. Payed 30 bucks and it actually made me break out even more! I like the smell of the stuff and the cool sensation it leaves but it just didn't work for me.,0
"I've been using for about 10 days...my teeth look whiter than they did when I started but I also have gotten my teeth cleaned this week. I have had zoom bleaching done twice and this is not anything like the results you can achieve with zoom, but it has given me modest results in only 10 days.",1
"We quit using this product when a red rash appeared on my husbands underarms.f
He stopped using this product and rash went away.",0
nice!!,1
"Product review is great.  I have been using this cream for several years and have found it to be helpful.  The problem is the current product ad which is confusing and misleading.  There are two types of pictures in the ad:  One which represents the tube (older model) and an another set that represents the pump (newer model).  The ad suggests that this is for 0.75 oz tube but has both pictures.  The item I received was the 0.5 oz pump.  My suggestion for anyone ordering is to not order from this company since it is not fully clear in what you will receive (my guess is that they may still have a few old tubes in the warehouse but they have labeled both of them the same).  I ordered this since I figured I would get a few extra ounces for only a few dollars more.  What happened was I spent a few dollars more and got the smaller bottle.  Since it was fulfilled by Amazon, they did make things right but probably not worth the hassle.  Hope this helps.  Good luck!",1
Did nothing for my long hair....Still dry,0
too expensive. The 4 bottles almost the same fragance .,0
have been using it for years,1
This is not the same as the shampoo I ordered before  it is pink and it does not work like my last bottle I am very disappointed and will not order it again  I only have it a star so I could warn people,0
I love Smith and Cult. This color is more grey than I wouldlike but it perks up when I add some of their  holographic glitter!,1
The smell is a bit stronger than the ones in the old Davines bottle. I've bought this all the time and was surprised by the smell.,0
You can actually feel this cream tightening up your skin....been using it for over a year and definitely see the difference!,1
I ended up being allergic to this formula. Nice color but something in the ingredients did not sit right with my body.,0
"This is the original formula of Strivectin's eye cream, which I prefer to the newer. It keeps the skin around the eyes from being dry with absolutely no irritation to my eyes.",1
"For years I have shaved with an electric razor. I've never really enjoyed shaving though. In fact, if I went more than one day without shaving then my electric would hurt more. I had the occasional ingrown as well. I tossed around buying a straight razor, but had visions of slicing my carotid and blood spurting from my neck. This review will also be a short summary of my entry into wet shaving, along with a review of this razor.

Now I actually look forward to shaving! I bought the Merkur long handle since I though the longer handle might provide some more stability while I learn. I was right about this. It has good weight, proper balance, and just has the perfect heft in my hand. The angle of the blade seems right as well. When I put a blade in and tighten it down, I can tell that the blade flexes a bit and it appears to be perfectly centered and aligned evenly. No funny angles on the blade. Craftsmanship is solid.

It did take a while to figure out how to shave without nicking myself. The three most important factors were: 1. The pressure I put on it, 2. The direction of the shave and, 3. The texture of my shaving foam. I have some hairs on my neck that grow totally sideways and fairly flat to the skin. With this razor, I first pass with the grain, and for those hairs my final pass is perpendicular. I just can't go against the grain without nicking myself. Even if I use no pressure at all, just the pressure of the razor, I still get nicks on that section. I blame my face, not the razor. I go against the grain on the rest of my face with no problems. This razor is aggressive enough that you could mess up your face pretty well if you try to push too hard. But is also forgiving enough that if you don't put pressure, you get a very close shave without the nicks. My face was NEVER this smooth with my electric. If you don't have to wear a suit to work, you could get away with shaving every other day. It takes me between 10 - 15 minutes to shave now, but I look forward to it with anticipation.

I was tempted to spend the extra for the full stainless steel, but I'm glad I didn't for my first razor. I wipe off the soap residue after each shave and the chrome has retained it's full luster. I shave daily with it, but not in the shower. I rinse it with hot water before I hang it since I figure it will dry out faster this way. I have had it for several months now and it still looks brand new. I am now buying this for my brothers for their birthdays! If you are considering dropping the electric, or disposables, or Dollar Shave Club, do it. You won't look back.

I purchased the Astra Platinum blades, and like them...but that is a different review. I have tried three different creams/soap and so far I like the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood the best, but that is also a different review. I also bought both a badger hair brush and a boar hair brush. Each has it's advantages and I use them both. I am otherwise busy enough that I am happy to make the extra time to shave this way. The variety available with a wet shave will turn an otherwise boring start to your work day into a peaceful, almost spa like experience.",1
This is by far my favorite color so far,1
"I have the black tea one and the grapefruit one. I brought both of them together when they were on sale to try them. I love them both. They smell great, moisturize lasting and has SPF. Although I had to reapply it throughout the day(eating and all that), I can feel that the moisturize can last for the day. And I also love it about the fact that the ingredients are very nature. I am very cautious about the ingredients when it comes to the lip balm, because you can literally end up eat the ingredients. This lip balm is very friendly and great~ The reason why I take one star off because of the regular price. I have no complain other than that.",1
A nice clean product. Does the job!,1
"I ordered this from South Korea, and it came safely without any problem.
color name espresso had been cracked a little, but that's okay.

easy to blend, very smooth, perfect color, nice big mirror.....
I love the product, but not Amazon's packaging.",1
I have owned this straightner for 6 months now . Before I had always used a CHI but heard good things about hot tools so I wanted to give it a try . I have used the same heat protectant and haven't changed my products from previous years . All products are salon quality . This straightner pulls my hair out and has destroyed my ends !! When using my chi I never had this problem.  I have been trying to make it work bc of the price . But after having to cut 3 inches off bc of destroyed ends IM DONE !!,0
"First of all, how cute is this product?!! While it didn't much for my hair, it made my daughter's hair like silk, which for me is worth purchasing it in the first place. My daughter has normal hair with a ton of keratin but she gets terrible tangles that cause her to cry when I try to untangle them. When we use this the brush goes straight through with almost no tangles and it smells awesome!!!",1
Its not everything they say it is.  I don't really see any good results.  Ive been using It fora year.,0
"These are fantastic. NO more rash and work better than a ""normal"" antiperspirant!!  Can't believe how effective they are!!",1
"The bottle was busted upon arrival. The lotion was in a bag, but even so, it was starting to leak out.  Luckily the other item it was delivered with was in its own plastic bag. I didn't get to use any of it. Some of the lotion that had leaked out was turning a brownish, yellow color.",0
"The Half Up is in theory a great idea for people who want an easy way to put up their hair. I struggled to get this to work. My hair was too layered, so it kept falling out. After only a couple of uses, the wire got so bent that it's permanently twisted.",0
"I have been wanting a brush like this for a long time. I'm glad I waited, this one is perfect!
It deep cleans your skin without irritating it. What a difference in my skin since using this!",1
Nice scent !!!,1
I bought for my wife she says it's ok and does the job... she says it isn't as hot as her old style one. But she is happy with it. It does get hot quick and it's pretty small. Digital so I can help her turn it on in the mornings,1
I've been using this body sorbet for years and love it. The smell and consistency is fabulous.,1
Love how it smooths my hair but can't really make long curls like my other straightener. But it works very well.,1
"All macadamia prodcuts are great!! However the qaulity youll recieve from amazon is sub-par, product was opened when i recieved it..Look for a different retailer if interested in this product.",0
Very hydrating,1
Makes my hair feel waxy. Also makes my head itch,0
Smells and feels good. Like it!,1
The two cans I received did not have lids/caps and had sprayed out a little in the box???,0
"I'm so disappointed at this product. My skin is still the same. Just waste my money,waste my time and it gave me a fake hope.",0
I am really tough on my nails and this seems to be helping a lot.  The only thing I have noticed is that when I am crafting the tips do wear down and chip if I have about 5 layers on.,1
"Easy to use, covers nicely perfect for between touch-ups.  I have tried different touch-up products but this one works the best.",1
made my natural nails peel,0
Best moisturizer ever!!,1
"Great cleanser! If you're someone that doesn't want an overpowering scent, I would use this face wash. The peach scent isn't too strong, and I didn't need very much to wash my face. My only complaint is that I didn't feel a substantial difference in my facial skin quality after using this.",1
"Disappointed in this product,did not live up to its promises or hype. Will not purchase again,sorry to say.",0
There are way better products out there than this. I felt this was a waste of money; it didn't do anything for my hair.,0
"Its got a nice texture but did nothing for me.  Considering the price, it is not worth it.",0
"Smells amazing, I use this as a setting spray for my makeup or just when I need to smell this amazing spray.  Smells like real roses, not that gross artificial rose smell.",1
Another enhance my good looks scam.  The quantity in the tube is small and ordering add'l. supplies expensive.  Being encouraged to have this automatically purchased and sent at intervals is a sure way to waste money.,0
total crap!!!! This fragrance doesn't last more than 20 min. Don't buy this!,0
Smells great. Preps for the reat of yoir skin care products! Im on my 3rd bottle!!,1
"used by a 15 year old girl with severe acne and helped her with the problem, not drastically, but fairly enough to be noticed.",1
Was not happy with this product at all.  It didn't really absorb any oils in my hair like I thought it should have.  It smelled so bad I didn't want to be around anyone when I was using it.  It just doesn't smell clean or fresh at all.  It's just bad.  I just can't recommend this product to anyone.  It scared me from trying any other ones.  I wasted my money.,0
Excellent product. This is my second one.,1
"DO NOT BUY FROM HERE!!!!!!  My shipment arrived on NOV 12TH and as I'm writing this review around my eyes are swollen,crusty, red. Also my lips. They are RAW and peeling. I stopped using this bottle for a couple days and it got a little better, but applied it last night and it is now worse than ever!!!!I  What did they do put acid in it? On my pic you can see the puffiness above and below my eyes. DO NOT BUY FROM HERE!",0
great product fast shipping and if you need just a bit more control this is the thing to use,1
"I used 4 bottles of this product, didn't see any change at all.:(",0
Leaves a lot of residue,0
"When applied, this looks horrible and watery...nothing like when purchased in a store.
I would not recommend buying these online.
Very disappointed.",0
Works well!,1
very nice!! i don't like fragrances too much but this one changed my mind. smooth but yet long lasting scent...i'm glad i bought this!!,1
Scam,0
"So far so good!  Time will tell if it actually improves skin texture.  It is light enough on the face, has a light scent and is not greasy at all.",1
great brush,1
"Very sharp blades, almost too sharp sometimes at least with my particular razor. A great deal and last a good while, maybe about a week's worth of shaves before they get too dull",1
"After exactly 2 years from my purchase date, I had the exact same issue fail which others have experienced. The motor breaks loose in the housing and the fan blades rub against the side and make a horrible noise. This is a design flaw and I urge you to AVOID this at all costs. It is not worth spending so much on a hair dryer which WILL fail within 2 years. This is no exaggeration.. The fan generates significant torque and vibrations and is held in place with screws into thin plastic.",0
I got the sample and really did like the lotion but then I read the reviews about the strong scent and now the scent bugs me too! Its super sweet like cotton candy.  Its not really strong but its not a scent that I like. Floral or unscented would be way better.,0
This doesn't seem to be the original product. I had bought this item before from ULTA and really liked it. But when I got it from amazon it was just not the same. It leaves white residue (ULTA product did not) and it made my hair look and feel more dirty after a few hours.,0
"I would not recommend purchasing this. I ordered the last, so called, ""Luxury Beauty Box"" and extremely disappointed. Most of what I received were samples I could get free in the mail, like a bunch of foil packets. Most hardly had enough product for even a one time use. It also included 5 perfume sample and, despite the name of the box, it had a sample for men and one for children. And, while you do get the credit for $19.99, it's only good for a few select items. Just something to keep in mind before ordering.",0
"This is a new adventure to me, but after years of no choices in shaving, I decided to change the way I shave. Using Proraso shaving soap was a part of that decision. All I can say is wow, what a great decision! I enjoy lathering up and taking off my whiskers cleanly and with little drag. I give this product my strongest endorsement and would add if you are thinking of changing the way you shave, this is a product that will absolutely help you make that change.",1
Great product,1
"Thanks, that is what I expected",1
"I bought step 1, I was wondering what step 2 is?? I just started using step 3, and so far so good,  no burning.",1
Useful,1
"Cannot live without this product. I first tried it when I had a terrible skin rash in the summer. Not only was this the only thing to soothe it but have since found that your skin when irritated or regular can be washed with only this to soothe it. Helps with any irritations you may have or after medical treatments as well. Just spray to wet your skin, then blot off.",1
DISAPPOINTED  I don't know what say about quality but I've bought mine because I've loved another like it that I still have. I Am very disappointed because the black isn't the same! It has some golden drawing very ugly and not the same as picture!,0
Way overpriced. It has a pleasant scent but it's sticky. Lose the aloe. There are better cooling gels out there.,0
The product was not sealed and dispersed in the carton completely,0
Love this cleanser. Smells and feels great on your skin. You only need a little bit at a time. Lasts a long time. Skin looks great. I'll be buying another for the shower.,1
Like it a lot!,1
"I had high hopes for this being true to its word as water resistant. I swim, and my back and arms were burned after an hr in the pool. If you don't swim it may work well. It blends in clear. Not moisturizing.  I RECOMMEND BABYGANICS Suncreen. It has a thick white zinc cream that is a barrier type spf. Problem of white out on your skin is to follow with a dusting of real cocoa powder and rub in. Ya smell Da-licous!
.",0
Did not cover my nails. I put 2 coats on and it left streaks too. I gave it away.,0
"Sadly disappointed. I bought this shampoo and conditioner because I had tried a sample size of this when I was on vacation and had wonderfully sleek and soft hair for days. I was in love and had to get more. Unfortunately, the full size bottle never delivered and left my hair feeling weighed down w/residue :( For that alone I wouldn't have given such a low rating but these were expensive and came in verrrry slim bottles (I didn't realize how little 6 oz was until I received the bottles and realized they were half the size of a regular shampoo bottle). Not at all worth it for the price. Would not buy again.",0
"Important: This item cant be returned since it requires special transportation and handling which we cant provide. Use the Contact us button for help addressing your issue.

The color is like those pink plastic nails, it doesn't dry completely, so you be disappointed thinking that you are getting the same gel system used by the nail places and it is NOT.  Don't buy it, also note that it is not returnable.  Mine went to the garbage.",0
I've only been using this for a week now and I think I love it. I missed one day and wish I had it on. It Blends well it feels like and I know it's working,1
It does not get very hot! Pulls hair,0
Not what I expected from the advertisement for $25.00!!!,0
It's very good item I like it,1
"This is my go to eyeliner! It lasts all day on my oily lids, and it never budges. It's also super dark. I wish it was completely matte, but it's not that shiny either. For some reason when I buy this eyeliner from Amazon, it's noticeably drier than when I were to buy it from a brick and mortar store. You don't really get as much usage out of it because of that. I continue to order it from Amazon just for sheer convenience, but if I'm ever out, I always buy it elsewhere.",1
"I am not sure about this product. I read previous reviews and it seems that consumers believe that counterfeit products were sold. My bottle does not smell remotely like almonds. It has a very unpleasant chemical type smell. However, I am not familiar with this product so I am not certain if this is how it should be. But, no matter, I can't recommend it as the odor is u pleasant. If I find out if it's counterfeit, I will report back.",0
I didn't see any change in my hair unfortunately.,0
Only used once or twice a month but not working affer a year.. very dissapointed.,0
this item I received is a used one.  I got to return it and got my refund but took a few weeks for that.  It costed me time to do the return and all that.  I got to order a brand new one from another official online store.  Didn't cost much more and come with fact cleanser and mask.  Not bad at all compare to buying one that is little cheaper on amazon but getting a product that is not brand new.  Do watch for things like this on this site.  My final cost for this is it delay me 3 weeks before I get to use it.  It worked great and my skin improved so much.,0
"fast service, great product.",1
"smell was ok, pine scent. Wore it once and my armpits were itchy because of it. haven't tried it since. Think it's just my body saying no...",0
It's along the lines of a cheap looking pink.,0
Like some of the MB products but not this one.  Feels sticky & doesn't seem to absorb.,0
"My husband and son love the Art of shave products. Great shave, clean  and soothing",1
"It feels really nice On my lips, but that's just it, it sits ontop of my lips. It does not moisturize or do anything for my skin. After it wears off (which happens pretty soon after application), my lips are left dry, and cracked.",0
I did not see any difference in shine after an hour. Very disappointed given the brand and the hype around this product.,0
I don't like that you cannot know when it's coming to the end!,0
Fell apart and crumbled all over the place.,0
"This blow dryer is amazing. I can't believe how reasonable the price is for the incredible quality of this dryer! I've had mine for a few years and it still works great. After using mine, my mom ordered one for herself. It is a little heavy but I've dropped it many times and it has never broken!",1
"After reading the reviews I thought this product would be exactly what I've been looking for. By almost the end of the bottle my hair never looked worse or felt so unhealthy. I had to have a professional conditioning treatment and about 3.5 in cut off because it was so dried out. I have long fine hair, and wash/dry about every other day. Might just be my hair type, but it did not work well for me. I used along w/ the conditioner. I did NOT purchase or use the oil. Maybe that would've made a difference.",0
Too sticky and shiny for me.,0
"Product does not work as advertised.  Used for almost 3 months and saw absoutely no difference in the thickness or length of my lashes,
Product was expensive and reviews prompted me to buy it, but I was very disappointed.",0
"Quality seemed good.  Lasted a good long while. (Keep out of standing water!) Think I still prefer the Melaleuca Gold Bar, however, as I know the REAL tea tree oil is used in it's making. Would like more info on the source of Tea Tree oil used in this product.",1
"I wear Seduce and I love it! Stunning shade and goes really well with olive tones and darker features.  The lipstick applies smooth and doesn't dry out my lips, which tends to happen to me when I use other brands. It's surprisingly long-lasting, given the moisture/smooth texture, and does NOT dye my lips after a long day of wear. I am a BIG fan of this lipstick and the brand!",1
"Very handsome masculine scent - a friend has used it for years and I decided to try it  and love it.  It's a nice fragrance, but is not overpowering.  Highly recommended.",1
I'll stick with blue cap Rusk from now on. Just thought I'd try something a little different and boy was I sorry. Broke my scalp out. The blue cap lid gives me 0 issues. Cannot recommend the pink cap.,0
Great,1
"This stuff kills all the skin on your scalp. I don't normally get dandruff, but this poison gave it to me. It wasn't 47 bucks when I bought it, but I can't imagine charging so much for an inferior product that does more harm than good.",0
As usual Essie has another hit!  Great color for a mani/pedi for summer.  Looks great on most skin tones  Shipped quickly too.,1
Luxury samples?  Not quite.  Disappointed in the quality  - nothing more than samples,0
"Worst top coat I've used. I love OPI nail polishes, but this is terrible. It takes forever to dry, even after 8 hours it still dented.",0
"This did not put curl in my hair, let alone hold it.",0
yep,1
I have been using this product now for over 35 yrs!  I love it !!!!!!,1
My second blow dryer I buy Elchim it burns with one year never buy it from Amazon or any other websites only from Elchim company itself,0
"This is a light weight, non-greasy sun screen that looks awesome!  I would definitely by both this and the non-tinted version again.  Well worth the price.",1
"I'll never know whether lasers work on wrinkles or not. Product stopped working after 1 day, and the replacement stopped working after a few minutes.

Two stars because at least Amazon took it back and I got a full refund.",0
"This heats up fast, I think, and it's really easy to use.  The downside is that there doesn't appear to be a ""ready"" light, so you kind of have to guess when it's hot enough.  But it's really fast and light, so I can do my whole head in just over five minutes, and so far no damage to my hair.  My hair is pretty thick and curly/frizzy, so I do section it off and do it in layers and chunks.  Even with all that, it doesn't take much time at all.",1
"Works great once you get the knack of using it.  Undetectable, a very good product.",1
"I've read quite a number of reviews where this hair dryer stopped working in less than a year. It shorts out. Had it fixed twice but the same problem occurs each time after a few months of use. If you get this working, do not unplug it. It may not work again. Since Babyliss is now owned by Conair, I'm wondering why Conair doesn't fix this issue. It's the wiring.",0
"Caused me to breakout, still on the quest for a sunscreen that does not clog my pores.",0
I didn't like this product as well as the Chi. I had to put it on the highest heat to straighten my hair. The bottom part gets very hot on the outside too.,0
The product was used for six months and produced no results.  I will not buy this product again as it did not work.,0
I'm so glad Red Door Deodorant is still the same unlike the Fragrance the EA has changed and not for the better (lacks the soft feminine fragrance like this Deodorant still has)  Always a favourite of mine second to Blue Grass of course.,1
I've used it once and love it already!!,1
"I have long, thick, curly hair and I have three daughters with long thick hair too. Two have straight, one is curly like me. I've been using this before styling their hair and it really seems to help with reducing tangles and increasing shine. I don't use heat on their hair very often so I can't speak to the thermal protection it provides. I also have been using it along with my pure Aegean oil and coconut oil and it seems to be a good addition to the mix. Less greasy than plain oil and definitely more shine. It does have a mild fragrance, I don't love the smell but it doesn't bug me either. I would definitely recommend to anyone with lots of hair!",1
"Broke after 4 months, heat comes on and off when you move it around, its handle squeaked straight out of the box.
Not amused.....",0
"This did not fit one of my blow dryers that has a slightly wider barrel. I use it on a smaller, travel type dryer. It does a good job, though.",1
"I still have tangles after using this. It's not as effective as The Conditioner. I will be going back to that when this bottle runs out. I've got thin fine hair and this weighs it down.

Edited to add: This works GREAT for my curly girls.",1
"As someone who has spent their entire life with very dry skin, this is a god-send. This product has been the only facial cream to work effectively without causing me to turn beat red.",1
"I did not like this cream.  It had a waxy like texture and did not absorb well into my skin.  Would not buy this again,",0
"Since coming to the world of DE shaving, I've tried most of the shaving creams out there.  You don't have to get the most expensive products to get a great shave.  Proraso consistently performs as advertised, giving a comfortable, close shave.  And for ten bucks - you can't beat the price.  Even though I enjoy other brands as well, Proraso is always on my shelf.",1
"I love Sabon products, but had never tried their body wash. It's light and delightful and has lasted a lot longer than I expected, which means it has turned out to be very good value for the money.",1
"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1
Did not work for me...,0
"Recommended by my stylist. Made my hair too flat and greasy, just didn't work with my fine hair.",0
"I used the Australian brand Mirenese for several years, then I couldn't find it again.  Blinc to the rescue!

I love how it doesn't clump, flake or smudge all day long.  And I have very sensitive eyes so I can't wear most brands.  Not with this formula, however.  I also don't like black mascara on me, I'm just too fair and black makes me look like a harlot.  I get the dark green because I have green eyes, I also plan to get the dark blue.

 But the very best part is the removal...just warm water and a washcloth is all you need.  Gently hold the wet washcloth to your lashes for about 10 seconds.  Then, gently slide the washcloth off the lashes.  It will look as if you have your lashes on the cloth, but it is just the little tubes that the mascara forms around each individual lash. You may need to wipe the lashes a second time.  Just be very gentle, since the skin around your eyes is very delicate, and you obviously don't want to tug on your lashes either.

Trust me, this stuff is worth every penny.",1
"I ordered dark brown.  I was sent black.  I immediately emailed them, they apologized, told me to return and they would send correct color.  I sent it back the same day, have never heard from them or recieved product or refund.  All I want is what I ordered.",0
"This can be painfull when used near jaw bone, I have to set at lowest setting for there and highest everywhere else",1
Great color has a little iridescent which makes it interesting,1
"Really nice shampoo, lathers and cleans great and smells terrific. BUT...I cannot justify paying 28 dollars for a tiny bottle. Nothing is that good, sorry! If price is no object, then I would give it more stars.",0
"The Macadamia Professional Style Extend is a basic dry shampoo, that does the job of soaking the oils from your hair. After using it my hair doesn't look revived or like freshly washed, but it helps me get a good hair day in between washes if I get too oily. I have thin frizzy dark hair, and since I workout a lot my hair tends to get oily without notice.

It's a powerful dry shampoo formula (the starches are quite good at soaking every bit of oil/moisture) so a little goes a long way and it's too much if my hair is just a little oily. I personally never let my hair get very greasy, but I think this formula would work best on really greasy hair. Also, on a stretch, I could go two extra days after applying this dry shampoo, but personally I wash my hair as fast as I can after using dry shampoo (maximum one day).
This dry shampoo doesn't leave as much white cast as others, but it's definitely not translucent. If I apply just the right amount, I don't get white residue; but I usually apply dry shampoo in the evening, so it has time to absorb the oils during the night. The instant effect is quite dry and powdery, leaving the product in overnight looks better for me.

This dry shampoo adds some texture to the hair, helping with the styling.

Since it's a powerful dry shampoo, it dries my scalp a little too much. But I use dry shampoo only for `emergencies` (or lazy days), so my scalp doesn't suffer too often. If I apply too much it makes my scalp a little itchy, but most dry shampoos do that.

The scent is quite pleasant (something in between a blend of floral, fruity and luxurious oils). I would love to find a good non-flagranced dry shampoo, but this scent is mild enough not to bother me too much. The scent does linger in the hair, but it's not overpowering.

I would compare the formula with Batiste Original (which is cheaper) and with Living Proof Perfect Hair Day (a little more expensive), but this Macadamia dry shampoo gives me less white cast than those two.",1
This is awesome!  I'm amazed at how well it works.  It completely removes all the make up.,1
ok,1
This is great stuff. Smells and works amazing. You get a ton of it for the price as well. Definitely try some.  You won't be disappointed.,1
returned wrong thing,0
"This works well and I like it a lot for little white-head type of pimples. I suggest inverting the bottle a few times and then using a cotton ball or swab to apply. Watch-out! it's super volatile, I think it has high alcohol content or something it burns the eyes and skin so don't apply to cuts, or open skin, I would steer very clear of the eye and mouth and under the nose area too. The only issue I have is that I feel like it really burns the skin, so much so that I smell burnt flesh after applying... But hey, my pimples dry up really fast so I guess its worth it right...",1
"holds toppik fiber in place pretty good, not for rain or water though",1
"This was definitely formulated exclusively with fair-skinned customers in mind. Mineral sunscreens will always have a white cast, and they've balanced it just a bit by adding a very light beige tint to the product, but this will only be useful if your natural lip color is very light (I'm not sure why they didn't opt for a rosy tone that could have been a little more universal). I have a light/medium skin tone and this looked very unnatural/whited-out on me. The formula is also a little greasier than I would normally like in a lip balm, and I'd love to see it with a bit more wax, heavier oils, or even some powder fillers to give it a little more thickness and longevity and a more even application (since mineral sunscreens need to be on in a thick and even layer to protect, and I can see just how unevenly it's applying since it's so light on me). I have taken to applying this over a sheer matte pink-toned lip color to balance some of the whiteness out. The ingredients are good and it's great to see someone doing a sunscreen lip balm without chemical sunscreens, but the execution really leaves a lot to be desired- especially if you're a person of color or have pigmented lips.",0

LUV see same product review for this great adult acne system,1
Total counterfeit! Still dealing with hair issues 7 months later! That's how much damage this caused. No idea what's in it but it's not conditioner!,0
Its not everything they say it is.  I don't really see any good results.  Ive been using It fora year.,0
This product did nothing that it claimed on the label. The only reason it gave my hair any volume is because the conditioner is like water and my hair is complete friz. BIG waste of money!,0
Did not work for me as advertised.,0
Unable to even use the product. The bottle of shampoo exploded and only about half of product was left. Will not be buying again because product too expensive to have damaged prior to using.,0
"I've used the hydrating Pureology for the last year and thought I would try the Strength Cure. I had highlights that were massively over processed and damaged my hair. At first it seemed very drying, but I gave it a month, and to my disappointment, has stayed very dry. It seems to really clean your hair so I'll give it that. Conditioner disappointment as well. I will go back to the hydrating shampoo,and have discontinued using.",0
"Love this flat iron! The heat pads are longer and slimmer than most, making it easy to straighten small amounts of hair like bangs as well as long lengths of hair.",1
"I've had this dryer for a couple of months now and it's great. Straightening my long, thick, wavy hair with a round brush goes much quicker than with my previous less expensive dryer. There is no adjustment on the temperature, just a ""I"" and ""II"" speed setting and a cool shot button. The air that comes out of this thing is really hot! A minor design flaw is that it's easy to accidentally bump the switch to off while you are using the dryer. Overall, I'm a happy camper on this one.",0
"This product didn't work very well for me.  I've enjoyed Paul Mitchell products in the past, but I felt that this was a heavier and stickier product and it made my head itch.  I had better luck with a root lifter from Target.  I have thick hair, so perhaps this might be a good product for someone with thinner hair, but not for thick.",0
"I have been using this product for about 2 years now and I must say, it is the best I've used and will not return to others.  My sagging AND heavy skin (fat) was made worse after working out and losing weight a few years back (tis true that exercise may cause one to lose weight but not always helps with sagging necklines).  This is a miracle cream...it tightens so well and you can actually see my jawline now which hadn't been seen in many many years.  This product, while expensive (for me anyway), really is worth its weight in gold.

I will say, be warned, I made a purchase here at Amazon form a private seller and rec'd an empty container/jar.  I was pissed!  I did get refunded but please know the seller or read up on the sellers because apparently SL is in demand.",1
Sticky mask and no soothing effect,0
Smells really good but doesnt keep my hand moisturized.  The scent does last for awhile before washing.,1
Best smelling parfum ever! Everyone compliments me on how well it blends with my body chemistry! My Mom and I will wear this as our signature scent! Thank you,1
"PLEASE PLEASE PLASE DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!! I cannot stress how horrible it is! The buffering lotion and drying cream did absolutely nothing, and the drying lotion flared up my acne to the worst point it has ever been. If you want to save your skin from a bunch of hyperpigmentation marks, then don't buy this!",0
very good facial cleanser,1
"I bought this to replace my T3 which is my second one in 6 years. I figured technology had caught up with dryers and this one said it was ""professional"" It is not at all like my T3 it is more like a crappy hotel hairdryer.",0
Thick cream that works well but it is way too expensive.,1
Received my package today & was excited to get home from work and try it. After showering my husband proceeded to apply the butter and with seconds it began to flake on my skin and I had to wipe it off with a wet towel. My stomach still feels gritty. Im so very disappointed.,0
"Benzoyl Peroxide seems to be much more effective than the Salycilic (sp) Acid-based products for my daughter's skin, and this one seems to be effective without over drying her skin.",1
Love it. Goes on so nicely.,1
I spent  too much on this kit. There are much better values available and i think the set is a little excessive. applying creams two times a day was overkill and caused me to break out.,0
"So disappointed. Used this product at the beach over the weekend, applied and reapplied and my face got SO burnt so I was extremely crispy at my brothers wedding...",0
Clears up skin of black heads and white heads.  Does tend to dry out skin.  Recommend using moisturizer after use.,1
It's makes my face oily!!!!!!!!!!,0
"my son loves it and I love it. Its a beautiful smell. It doesn't smell that strong, as other reviewers have mentioned.",1
Completely stripped the gray from my hair and left it blonde. Just terrible,0
I am really not sure if the claims are accurate. So far it does not do all the miracle things it promises . My hot iron works better and easier..my hair does tangle if I am not careful. I will probably send it back,0
"Not since we were yuppies (yes, I'm old) have I had a bar of soap in the house which was this pricey.

But, if price is of no consequence to you, this would be a lovely soap to have for yourself or guests.  First, it's very attractive.  The bar is basically a creamy white, with the green stripe you see.  The green having a hint of translucence.  The overall effect one of having been poured/made by hand.

The odor is delightful.  To me is was limey and 'fresh'.  For a man it might have been too strong a scent to carry from the shower, but I found that most of the scent is washed away so no one should object to using this bar --man, woman, child.

So a very nice guest soap.  It's perhaps too harsh for babies, but for grimy visitors fatigued from monument hopping in the stern summer sun... it should get them clean and possibly refreshed enough for dinner.",1
Great product!,0
"The soap does the job, but the scent was not what I expected; 80% of the reason I buy shave soap is nostalgia of times past;  its a reminder of times when my dad use to take me to the barber with him, we both got haircuts, the barber would clean up the neck area with shave soap and the straight razor.  The smell of that soap is the main reason I spend the extra bucks on these products; for this reason alone, this soap is a no go for me. Its not an unpleasant smell, its just not the right smell for me....",0
"I really like this product.  It does what it claims to do.  You use a tiny bit, spreads on smoothly, and, lasts all day with only one application.",1
"It was work will.
but now the hot air doesn't work! only the cold!!",1
"I followed the reviews and ordered this.  I agree with others, that it does go pretty light.  I realized that I can't put this on my nose because it makes it stick out!  I am 58 years old, and have been searching for a foundation that does not make my face look older, rather than helping!  This is really good, but still a little too dry if I apply it without a little moisturizing serum mixed into it.  Overall, I am happy with the results, with said exceptions.",1
"seems to work well.  I've been noticing less regrowth, but I am still having to shave.  It was explained with the directions that it may take months of use to fully show results, so I am willing to continue to use to see full effects.  Price, convenience and privacy definitely beats going to a salon/doctor's office for a treatment!!",1
Haven't tried the iron but it arrived clearly used. Returning it and buying somewhere elsse,0
Smells amazing and makes my hair so soft. I also like the thick like butter consistency. Amazing but not greasy.,1
"Unfortunately, the razor does not have the best system for changing blades. Quite possibly dangerous!",0
This product is so small not work 8 bucks more like 4 bucks.,0
Love this item!! Will buy again.,1
This is a great size for sampling the product even though it looks quite a bit bigger in the pic. I ordered them for my husband to try and it was perfect.,1
"After about two or three uses (I use it once or twice a week) my skin felt super smooth. All the little bumps were gone. However, my skin gets pretty greasy and shiny for a day or two after I use it. My skin is always pretty oily, but it gets even worse after I use this. Make sure you massage the tube a bit before you open the cap, or a bunch of liquid will leak out.",1
"My go-to-girl uses several Philosophy products. However, we were not aware Philosophy made a product for men.  After checking out the specifications and ingredients contained in Amen Men's Shower Gel, the order was placed.  Currently, I use a name brand shower gel with excellent results.  After using Amen shower gel, I must say this gel is by far the best ever.  First, I applied a quarter size amount of the gel to my extra long hair, wow did it lather up significantly more than the stuff I have been using.  Subsequently applied the same amount of the gel to the body - spreads smoothly with a lingering smell/fragrance.  Am impressed with the fresh clean feeling Amen leaves on hair and skin - a winner IMHO.  A bit pricey, however, well worth the cost, plus a little goes a long way!
Note: Ingredients & cautions label on the bottle.
I really like theneat sentiment on the bottle.",1
Loved this so much I bought 2 for stocking stuffers and my Mom-in-Law one!,1
the scent was not as strong as the mandarin orange one which I LOVED,0
Purchased as a gift for my husband and he loved  it!! Said it's the best shave he's had in years!!!,1
"This product is...interesting. I think I may not be the best candidate for this product because I have very dry skin. This left me looking blotchy the next day, which I did not love. The first day, however it looked great. Not at all orangey and fake tan looking. The odor is mild and not unpleasant. It's not something I'll continue to use, however. The 2nd day ""blotchyness"" ruined it for me.",0
Need more time,1
"Ok, so I've hard dark circles all of my life.  Not much I've been able to do with them except attempt to cover them up with concealer.  This works pretty well.  It doesn't completely cover them, but I haven't found anything that does.  For the most part, this is one of the best.  At first I didn't like it, but I kept coming back to it.  Mostly I use it when I'm not wearing makeup.  It looks very natural when I blend it into my skin.  Beware of the color match, I had to buy another one in a lighter color.  I kept the darker one for the summer.  It brightens up my eye area and makes me look more awake.  The reason for 4 stars is because you can still faintly see my circles.  I will buy it again unless I find one that covers completely.",1
"This product may work for some, but it didn't work for me.  Too thick and my skin just wouldn't really absorb it.  I couldn't stick with using it long enough to see any results.",0
"This was a horrible product - a complete fake.  It looked extremely cheap, and when i plugged it in and turned it on, and it would not even get hot.  Amazon charged me for returning it too.  I would NOT recommend this purchase - its better to spend the extra money on a real one from a reputable retail store.",0
i found other brands like batiste work better for my hair,0
Shipped quickly. Great top coat. Does not chip.,1
"It's a little expense,  but I like it.  Keeps you dry and has a pleasant scent.",1
Love the Glytone Product line... really helps to exfoliate skin and keep it smooth!,1
Didn't do anything other than clog pores more. I really believed this would work. I was very disappointed! I used it everyday!,0
"Don't sleep with this in. I spent a few nights at parties and in the morning, it looks like dirt and bugs in your scalp.",0
"I decided to try Mario Badescu Drying Lotion due to having acne prone skin. I have suffered my whole adolessent and adult life. I have seen this advertised for a few years and finally decided to give it a shot.
When I first got the drying lotion I was happy with the packaging and shipping speed.
As for the product itself, I am not in love with it. It has such a strong repulsive smell. I have to put this toxic smelling product on my face. YIKES! I felt guilty trying to use this and sharing a bed with my 9 month old. I felt like I was poising her & myself due to the strong smell.
The directions tell you to put this on and let it dry while you are sleeping and that it will flake off. WHERE!! In your bed, on your pillow etc.
Then to top it all off, it didn't work, even for a tiny brand new pimple.
I won't buy this again but am happy for people who this product works for.",0
"Like the nail polish anyway, but it's less of  a sky blue and more of a powder blue. It's fine and looks nice on tho, very glossy.",1
"Definitely repurchasing. I use this spray before and after I apply my skincare and makeup, and let me tell you, G.L.O.W.I.N.G is exactly what your skin will look like.
 I also had to travel to Japan for the summer which I knew would be a very long flight which meant very dry and uncomfortably tight skin, so to prevent that I poured some of the product into a travel size spray and voila! My skin felt soft and supple.",1
"I love CND Shellac but am very disappointed with this item. The color is so much lighter than what is shown in the bottle. it is definitely more pink than red. the finish is streaky and uneven. also, unlike other shellac polishes, this one peels, can dent, and chip. I tried it twice with different numbers of coats and different thickness levels and for the same results. lasted less than a week. totally not worth buying.",0
"I really like this moisturizer. It goes on smooth and feels great. No real scent to it, not heavy, absorbs quickly. My everyday moisturizer! : )",1
Much more orange and less terra cotta than on my screen. Applies well.,1
Very good only kind a expensive,1
My wife used this for two months with no positive effect.  Expensive doesn't always mean a good product.,0
"I would not recommend this product as a gel or paste-type styling agent. Hold is very poor. It also makes hair look shiny/greasy if used in moderate amounts. I mainly use it around the back and sides of my head to keep frizz/cowlick down. For any other use that involves styling and hold, I would recommend another product like Texture Dirt, which has much better hold and is much less visible in hair.",0
Scent on this product is incredibly strong. The spray top leaks and the bottle is too pliable.,0
The smell is over the top perfumey.  If you are sensitive to smells this isn't the product for you.,0
"Adorable packaging- seriously, I get comments all the time. The scent is nice and light- fruity, and the texture is soft. A nice light lipbalm.",1
"Well, I was dubious about this product to say the least.  It was the top review on this listing that convinced me to purchase the tiny bottle for $7.95 to see what this stuff was all about.  Let me say: Wow!  It DOES work!  I've included a before and after picture so you can see for yourself.

I helped my husband apply this for the first time; sprinkling strange little hair fibers on his head like a pepper shaker, then gently patting them into place.  Immediately, I learned to NOT use a heavy hand when applying this stuff.  Shaking out too much product onto one concentrated area is problematic.  Start slow, with a very sparse amount of product and layer it evenly over the area.  Gently pat with clean, dry hands to set.  Do not wipe or blend this product or it will look unnatural.  It lasts all day under normal conditions, especially if you lock it in place with hairspray!  My husband goes to the gym after a full day at work with Toppik on his scalp and it doesn't smudge or sweat off.

It works on filling in sparse patches of facial hair too, but it's trickier to mix it seamlessly with coarse, curly hairs.

The only downside to this product is that it's somewhat inconvenient to apply - but no more than any other makeup or styling product.  Once you get the method of application mastered, it shouldn't take more than ~5 minutes a day to apply and set.

I give this product five stars based on effectiveness.  Looking for solutions to baldness often feels like an unhopeful endeavor, so I highly recommend trying this product if nothing else has worked.  Toppik is by far the best result I've seen for realistic looking hair.",1
Can't live without this and Cellex -C.  These 2 products are the best.,1
pretty good a bit better than regualr polish lasts a little longer,1
I was so excited to get this box and try all of the products. I am very sad that most of the items only gave a one time use. Most of these samples are smaller than they would give you at a department store beauty counter. How are you to test something when you cannot try it twice?,0
Not impressed.  Too little product for the price.  Will not buy again. No miracle here!,0

good stuff.,1
So far this cream feels great on my skin and I wake up glowing. I have not been using it long enough to report any long term effects but I guess we will see! Not sure yet if it was worth the high price as I have used great creams for a lot less money in the past.,1
"Keeping skin hydrated is an on-going goal, and the challenge definitely increases in this part of the country where the norm is a cold dry winter, so I was interested in trying this product. Following the directions I applied a small amount to my fingertips, two pumps, and massaged it into my skin. Then I added a couple of drops of water which created a creamy emulsion which I had no problem rinsing off. My skin was left feeling soft, not oily.

Subjective reaction based on my experience -- I like the product but I also do not wear a lot of make-up so my main concern was not in removing water-proof mascara or other tough to remove substances. I was looking for a good cleanser to help moisturize rather than strip my skin of oil. When I do need a make-up remover, I use wipes designed for that job.

The scent is pleasant and does not linger. Only a small amount is needed for each use so the bottle should last a long time. I have been using the product for two weeks and have experienced no problems or bad skin reactions.",1
"First of all the spring on the iron broke within a week of purchasing it. I replaced the spring with the extra one that is provided, but the clamp never opened all the way again.  The iron barely lasted a year  before it stopped heating up.  I've had cheaper and better curling irons that lasted years.  Will not purchase this brand again.",0
It lasted less than 1 year before it stopped working.,0
Need light skin tone doesnt work on my pigment im not even that tan tho at all,0
Nice smell. Nice texture. But doesn't erase crepe.,0
You don't get the results for the price.,0
Excellent product I've used it many times before. I. saw the sale and make use of it.,1
been a fan of Stila for over 17 years.  They do no wrong in my eyes.,1
These fibers have a weird green tinge to them.,0
"Great colors, that last!!",1
The bottle looks like the real thing but the shampoo is thin in consistency and does not smell the same. This is a fake and I will not order again.,0
"Bought this on a friend's recommendation. Great lil razor. Great shave, felt great in my hand. After a 2-3 months, it accidently fell from counter height onto a bath mat and snapped. I know their warranty says it doesn't cover falls, as they told me though email as well. Just didn't figure one fall onto a cushioned bath matt would break it. Perhaps the stars aligned and it hit just right, I don't know.  Bought a cheaper brand which does the job, but not as well.  Probably won't ever buy another merkur. My friend's is an OLD  version passed down by an uncle. He was suprised at what happenned. Maybe they were built tougher back then, idk.",0
so disappointed. This is a GREAT cleanser but this cannot be the real thing. When I used this when i bought it from the actual website i needed a dime size amount and i had a TON of suds. Best cleanser I ever used and lasted forever. This stuff I bought off here is either watered down or not the real thing. I need more then a full handful to get hardly any suds going.,0
These are nothing like the original clips that come with the set.  Very disappointed,0
"I enjoy the thick creamy texture of this serum. It spreads very nicely on my face.  It also has a very faint iridescence to it, and looks nice on my skin. I've used almost a whole bottle, and can't really tell if it has had any lasting effects on my skin, but I definitely like the way it looks and feels and will be buying it again.",1
"I don't know if this product was old or not, but the color of the serum was very dark where usually it's not.  I love this serum and faithfully use it.",1
The barrel is too long; was difficult for me to handle.  I don't like that the clip only goes half way down the barrel so my hair kept slipping off.  I then ordered the shorter model where the clip that holds the hair in place is the same length as the curling iron itself.,0
"Was going to give it to someone for Christmas and it ended up coming to me opened!!! I was so upset, was so expensive for something so little and in addition it was open. Thank goodness I looked at it before I actually gave it as a present.",0
"Aged me! It sat in my lines and just did not keep my skin smooth. I was surprised, as Lorac is known to be a quality brand.",0
"I have coarse hair, they won't take.  It got on my scalp ok, not on the hair. I even pick out individual hair to apply the powder, still not taking the color.",0
Terrible for me. I feel like this stuff needs to be nuked in the microwave for 30 seconds first. I could not get this stuff to spread in my palms at all. And don't even think about applying this stuff in dry hair. You will end up with half your hair in your hands. Maybe I got a bad jar. Will never try again.,0
"I bought this flat iron because my old one finally went out after 8 years. Anxiously waiting for it, when it arrived; the iron was defective. The iron did not turn on at all. I plugged it into different plugs and it still did not work. What a disappointment. I needed it because my hair is frizzy without it. I contacted the seller regarding the defective flat iron and they did not respond until 3 days later asking me for an order number. I emailed them promptly with the order # for a refund and it took them another week and a half to respond. They do not stand by their motto for customer satisfaction.",0
"I've been using the Proraso white and green products for quite a while and like them very much. Curiosity moved me to try the red line and I am sold. Although I prefer the menthol, eucalyptus and green tea scents of the white and green products, the sandalwood line provides far superior lubrication and a closer shave for a coarse beard.  For me, the proof is in those mid to end of the week shaves when beard growth is limited to 24 hours or less between shaves. The sandalwood line makes those daily shaves much more comfortable and effective. The drawback is that you need to be able to tolerate the sandalwood scent which, in my opinion, is an acquired taste. Perhaps it's just that I'm more of a citrus/herbal kind of guy than a musky/woodsy one. Still, Proraso is a fine product line and one I highly recommend.",1
Works great. Lasts for a looong time. Smells gentle. What else to say? ;) PS. Arrived on time.,1
"Ladies don't waste your money, you can purchase Oil of Olay for cheaper and it's better. Ahava has a weird smell to it. I don't care for this product.",0
"I love this curling iron. My hair never holds curls, but it does now.",1
Works very well,1
"I normally don't wear lipstick or chapstick because it feels like it drys my lips out more than it moisturizes them.  I like the feeling of this lip butter when I first put it on, but after a short awhile my lips just feel sticky and dry again.  I did like the subtle color it provided but this is not something I will continue to use.",0
It was not a good moisturizer.,0
Love these. So easy to apply and the small size makes it great to have multiples in the car/hand bag/ bathroom etc. They last for a long time too!,1
This is magical!,1
Excellent product worth the experience,1
"This is fantastic powder. Even, fairly significant coverage. Looks great even applied with fingers!",1
"my old brush was worn out and i wanted a new and better brush.i have had good luck with proraso products.this brush works well,there were very few loose bristles.it had an odor for a few uses but that faded.the only thing that might have made it better would be shorter bristles.this product is worth the money",1
Mascara was dried up and would flake off. Very disappointed!  This isn't how the mascara is normally.,0
"I should've read the ingredients much closer. While DERMAdoctor Calm, Cool & Corrected had some good, basic moisturizing due to the inexpensive Silicones Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, and Petrolatum...which ALL trap moisture underneath (oil based, NON-biodegradable chemicals). Unfortunately that is not good long term, as the skin can't ""breathe"" and the sloughing off of dead cells (natural exfoliation) is hampered. Unfortunately, I found this out after my cheeks and lower face developed patchiness. But the WORST ingredient to me is the SQUALANE which is from SHARK LIVER OIL (verified) which is obviously harvested from sharks. Not only does that seem unethical -  as ""approximately 3000 sharks are required to produce one ton of squalene"" (source: [...]) - the expensive cost of squalane (refined squalene) being a top ingredient in DERMAdoctor CC&C...is passed on to the consumer. While these ingredients may work for you, I need to look for a different solution.",0
"I can see the appeal for what this product can be. For the most part it makes my hair smell and feel like heaven, but the down side is that it leaves my hair with build up after about 3-4 days of conditioner use. As a woman with naturally curly, thick hair - I wanted this to work but I can not be washing my hair every 4 days - It is not good for curly hair to strip it of oils so often. If you have naturally curly hair, I encourage you to give this product a shot. It may not be for me but it may be a product for someone else.",1
It leave my hair hard like hair spray,0
"This hair dryer is amazing!  I bought it in white from my hair stylist 4 years ago.  My sister couldn't believe I'd spend so much on a hair dryer, until she tried it and couldn't believe the difference it made on her hair.  We bought her this one in black for her birthday.  She LOVES it!  She said her hair has never felt and looked so good, and all because of a hair dryer.  A friend stayed with me last fall.  She has thick hair.  She commented on much faster her hair dried with it, and it was so much shinier and softer than when she uses her hair dryer at home.  She said she'd have to buy one when she got home.  You will not be disappointed with this dryer.  I've had mine for 4 years now, and it still works great.  It's lightweight, and I love the longer cord.  I take it with me when I travel.  I can't ever use hotel hair dryers again.  They fry your hair and make it feel like straw.",1
"I'm new to DE shaving and these were the first blades I tried. Very reasonable blade, though kind of expensive given alternatives. I've had some of my smoothest shaves yet with these. No cuts or burn with these for me and I have somewhat sensitive skin. I rotate them currently, but not afraid to go back to them.",1
"This tem Sounds really good to me, but i had to returned because after The second day my face was numbed and i couldn't talk. So i decided that medically was not for me.",0
The first use we could visibly see it working to soften the flakes. It did not rinse away like it says it should. It took 3 or 4 more washes to see a noticeable improvement. My babys flakes were really stuck on and difficult to remove and she had them all over her head. Now since using this shampoo she only has a couple spots with some flakes that are very hard to see. This does help but takes some time to work. Not 5 star because it didn't completely cure it. My baby had a very bad case of cradle cap though so if your baby isn't as bad as mine was it should cure it and Id still recommend this product.,1
AFTER USING THIS MY SKIN FEELS SO SKIN. IT IS THE ONLY WASH I CAN USE THAT DOES NOT IRRITATE MY FACE.,1
"For an expensive Chi product I expected better. I'm accustomed to the cheap drug store hair protectants and decided to try a more expensive, reputable brand. I figured Chi would make a great product, but I didn't like the spray at all. It left my hair feeling crunchy and gross. My hair felt completely fried after using it and didn't feel protected from a flat iron whatsoever. The product was really thick and sticky, so that's how it felt in my hair and all over my hands. Will be returning.",0
"I purchased this blow dryer 6 weeks ago.  On the positive side it has a GREAT volume of air flow with 3 heat settings.  It's also super quiet.  But on the negative side, the handle heats up after about 4 minutes of usage on the highest heat and blower settings.  It's very uncomfortable.  It's possible that it can get even worse, but I waited too long to return it, so I'm stuck with it.  Having read through a lot of the reviews on this product, I should have believed the people who said the handle was too hot.  This is ultimately just a poor design on Hot Tools part.  It's sad,because other than the handle, it's a great blow dryer.",0
"This water is amazing. It soothes and softens more than the other two I've tried (Evian and LaRoche-Posay, which are very good, just not AS good). It's unbelievably refreshing in hot weather.

The reason I took a star off is because the canister could use some work. The spray isn't as fine as I'd like, and it gets worse as you use it up. But I still buy it for the quality of the water.

One thing worth mentioning: When the weather is cold, you need to apply a moisturizer twice a day to use this water or your skin might dry out as it evaporates.",1
I don't even think that was actually Paul Mitchell because it smelled like white rain,0

While using it the product sprays out from the sides thus mess all over my hands and bathroom.,0
Since I started using ORIBE I have noticed a difference in my hair. This product does not weigh hair down,1
Nice color,1
"I purchased the pink shade. This lipstick moisturises for approximately four hours, and has a matte finish with a colour more akin to rose-violet than pink.

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a chemical-free moisturising alternative to regular lipsticks. Most companies purport to be ""all-natural"" or even ""organic,"" but their products are still infused with chemicals such as dimethicone (a silicone that prevents skin from breathing). For people with sensitive skin, or for those who, like me, just want to safely nourish their lips colourfully, Juicy Beauty Conditioning Lip Color is your answer.  Pink is for cool fair to beige skin tones, whereas Fig is for warm darker skin tones.

Only downside, in my opinion, is the small diameter of the lipstick applicator. It increases the time it takes to apply the lipstick.

And please, Juice Beauty, make it in more colours!",1
I use this in conjunction with the PCA pigment gel and they are the best combo together and really help to lighten up the marks I have had for YEARS!!!!! Recent marks have faded and the longer ones are on their way off my face and neck. Even helps to lighten a mark on my leg just in time for summer. YAY,1
Best C-serum that I have tried in ten years.,1
Smells good and is really hydrating on the skin. Very impressed,1
"Does not work as dry shampoo at all, does not add texture or volume.  when I used this product, my hair became sticky and tangled. The only positive is the pleasant subtle fragrance. If possible I would really like to return this.",0
"My 6 months Baby use this mustela hair and body shampoo since she was born. It washs gently, perfect for a Baby skin!",1
I used this product several times until I finished the bottle.  I put it on my hair and slept with it or left it on for several hours.  My hair felt worse each time after.  My girlfriend swears by it and has the most beautiful hair I have ever seen so pretty it looks fake.  She says her hair is soft after.,0
"I ordered this two nights ago and received it in a day and a half Normal shipping. i have always wanted this Iron. I put it around 330-340 I have wavy, curlyish hair. It works perfect but it did have two tiny mini scratches but its fine .",1

"Probably the best eyelash curler I've ever had.  It feels sturdy, and curls most of my lashes in 1-2 squeezes.  I have short, straight lashes and occasionally wear mascara, but when I do, always curl my lashes with this beforehand, and my eyelashes are actually visible :-)",1

"The Divine Youth Oil is Wonderful to use all year long.... It is a  MUST if you live in harsh dry winter climate that drys the delicate skin on your face. For our harsher winters in Washington state I combine it with the LOccitane 25% Shea butter face cream. My skin stays well hydrated, soft, and supple.",1
I purchased this shampoo to help with my thinning hair. I tried it until it ran out. At first I was kind of skeptical as to how well it would work but I was pleasantly surprised. My scalp felt better and I felt little hairs growing from my scalp where there were none before. I would recommend this product to any person wanting to stop hair loss.,1
"I was excited about this due to all the reviews and recommendation from my sister. I purchased 2 bottles, when I received them, one was cracked yet still sealed with the plastic and half empty. I returned it with no issues. However the one I did get to use, did nothing for me. It smells so good, but I didn't notice it making my hair better or any different for that matter. If you spray too much, it will feel soapy. In conclusion, I've tried better products than this.",0
I saw this in Real Simple Magazine and they raved about it.  I does not stay on very long.  Maybeline Matte Ink does and is so much less money.  I wasted a lot of money oh a product that does not do what it says.,0
"I love this product.  I had been using the dry lotion for a year and feel it really does the trick. I ran out and got impatient with the shipping speeds (when you have a pimple, you don't want to wait 3-5 days for your secret weapon).  So I found this set of three and Prime shipping was being offered.  I didn't need anything other than the drying lotion but hey, for next day delivery I didn't mind taking them all.

While I love love love the drying lotion, the other two are just okay.  I can't really tell if they make a difference.

The breakdown:
Drying lotion- it comes separated in the glass container.  The pink stuff is the magic and the clear liquid is alcohol.  You are suppose to keep them separated so do not shake them! If you have already shaken it (like I did my first time), worry not.  It will go back to separating after a day or so.  You take a cotton swab and dip down all the way into the pink stuff. Then apply on pimples.  I do it before bed.  It has a clay consistency, especially once it dries. But it is not uncomfortable because its being used on minor spots.  I use this at night time, after my husband has fallen asleep. Bright white spots all over my face can be pretty amusing for him and ugh... I like to pretend I don't need the beauty products. In the morning, I notice the pimples are visibly smaller and dried up.  Basically, its still there but not gross.  A couple days later, its gone.  Warning: this product does what it says, it dries.  So be prepared to have small dry flaky skin where you applied it.  I don't mind this.  I use exfoliate then use a good moisturizer afterwards.  I also recommend using a primer with hydration components in it if I plan on wearing makeup.

Buffering lotion- this one is suppose to be shaken before use. The bottle indicates that its meant to be used for those painful pimples.  The kind that are under your skin and throb. The liquid inside almost looks like milk.  Runny and thin. I drip it onto a cotton swap then apply to the painful spots.  It goes on so thinly, I often feel like I didn't use enough.  Especially since the others are so thick. In the morning, I do not notice a change in size or redness.  What I do notice is that it is no longer painful.  Which is a relief.  The next night, I follow my plan for drying lotion.

Drying Cream- I am still baffled by this one.  It comes in a tub of what appears to be think night cream.  It feels like a repair cream, meant to be used after the dryness of the drying lotion.  I use a cotton swab to apply this on dry patches overnight.  It goes on thickly and takes forever to dry.  Sometimes, I wake up and find the stuff smeared on my sleeve.  Sexy, I know.  The next morning, I find that it did make the dry area marginally better.  I would still prefer a good moisturizer to solve any dryness issues.

Overall, I am happy I bought all three and feel like its given me a solution for my random breakouts.",1
"I like this blush but I am disappointed in the cheap, plastic packaging. The ""metal"" paint is flaming off and getting caked in the blush. I like Jane iredale make up and it agrees with my skin so much, but they continue to downgrade their makeup packaging to cheap and shoddy plastic (such as their compact and eye shadow). I expect a little more for the price.",0
did not like it at all. not sure how the smell is even close to Bergamot and Tobacco,0
I used this product three times before it broke.  It simply does not heat up anymore!,0
"Horrible! Does not heat up very well and takes forever to straighten your hair. They have a lifetime warranty, which is a scam because you have to mail the broken straightener and pay $25 replacement fee. Mine broke after 1 month !",0
I have to say nothing special about this shampoo just typical one,0
Lover this perfume,1
I used this product for many years buying it from sephora. The one i received is very watered down and very hard to apply.,0
Sticky... I had to return,0
This stuff smells so nice and locks in moisture after I put makeup on my face. I feel flawless when I use it. And it smells good. :),1
Pretty color with long lasting shine. Looked the same on day five as it did one day one. ,1
"Dermatologist recommendation, however it is difficult to apply.  The product is good but if you have to fight to apply, not worth the time.",0
"Great product. Adds the perfect moisture, and not too oily! The only negative is the container it comes in. If you squeeze out too much you cannot put the lotion back",1
It is comparable to a Kirkland product at six times the price.,0
Good razor as described.,1

"I purchased this with the hope of being able to use it on my hair that was recently treated with a Brazilian Blowout
Treatment. Unfortunately, the second ingredient is laurel sulfate & I cannot use it.
I don't understand why it's listed as sulfate-free when it obviously isn't.",0
"I liked the smell, but was only able to get a few drops out and that was it.  Can't tell from the bottle if it was full.  didn't seem to be.  Definitely not worth the money.",0
"Used to be good, seems like its been going from bad to worse in the past 3-4 years. So bad that for the past few months have been using an alternative. Taylor of Old Bond Street somehow reminds me what this used to be.",0
I don't think it cleans my hair very well I will not purchase again,0
"I bought this specifically to use on my waterline to make my eyes appear a bit wider. When I first tried it on, I was impressed by how pigmented and creamy it was - except I had applied it with a heavy hand, so I had to blend it out (off) a bit. It turns out I like it better blended out because the color is too bright for my taste (I have a medium tan complexion). However, after several minutes and, presumably, a lot of blinking, I noticed that the color had faded out even more. I don't think I have extraordinarily watery eyes, by the way.

I used it again the next day, this time careful with how I applied it. I manage to put it on not as heavily as the first time, and it didn't get blinked off as fast the first time either. I went about my day as usual and checked it after several hours, and I was left with but a hint of color on my waterline.

I admit I'd rather find something for my waterline that isn't as bright, but if it turns out there's nothing out there that's more suited to my skin tone, I still wouldn't buy this because of its rather disappointing staying power.",0

"Longtime user of nioxin, but found out (along with a lot of the reviewers here) that nioxin was bought out by proctor & gamble and the ingredients for the shampoo have now changed..

really dislike the fact that when a great small product gets bought out (ie. kind bars, honest tea) by a larger parent company, immediately the larger company changes the ingredients to make it more diluted, processed, and ultimately cheaper.

new nioxin formula is not as good as the old and does nothing to remove ""DHT,"" which was the whole unique marketing angle of the original product!

no longer will be using nioxin. 2 good alternatives are:

"This did a pretty good job.  I have been using a 10 developer to cover grey for years.  I'm going to go a lot lighter now with my hair color in order to hide the grey.  Instead of using more bleach and several times at that, I thought using this to get as much of the dark color out as possible might be a better, less damaging option.  I would say it lifted my hair from a 3 to a 5.  The top of my hair which has been processed most recently (of course) seemed to release the color better than toward the ends.  I think the color has been done so many times toward the ends that it's just not going to give it up as well as near the more recently colored roots. I used half the product -- that is, 2 oz of part 1 and 2 oz of part 2.  I have shoulder length, not very thick hair; and this was plenty.  I kept it on for just about the recommended 20 minutes and applied a little heat.  After checking out results after first round, I was fairly satisfied so I used step 3 to finish.  This did make my hair a tad, just a tad darker but I'm done and will leave as it is.  Since this can leave hair more porous, I put a combination of grapeseed oil, jojoba oil, sesame oil, and vitamin E on my hair and slept with a shower cap overnight.  I washed hair in morning and it feels really good. As a final note, The smell was quite tolerable (like perm solution) and it didn't make my hair go back to grey which would be the the 'virgin' color, but it did lift the color pretty well.  Not a 'miracle', but certainly worth the $20 to damage your hair less (or not at all) than by bleaching.",1
"I've used Laura Geller eye shadow before and this one is not as good. The colors look pretty in the chocolate packaging but the pigment is low and flaky - not creamy like the type I already own. I tried to wet the brush first but it just made a mess, I was disappointed.",0

I just know that I received it in that condition, and it has no expiration date written anywhere.

Absolutely nothing special.,0
"This is a great company, but the Perfecting Creme was not my favorite. The smell was terrible and I couldn't get passed it. Very thick cream -which is usually a plus but this one doesn't go on smoothly.",0
Did not work at all for me. Made my hair really greasy after shampooing twice. Didnt make a difference in hair or scalp if anything it made my scalp feel worse.,0
"This scent is so.... grandma like, only not the cool, current grandma, more like the grandma of my youth whom I love so much, but whom I would love even more if she'd ease up on the perfume. So disappointed!",0
I didn't like it. It left my hair feeling like straw afterwards.,0
"Shade 06 is a violet/plum deeper shade with a light mauve or light lavender pale shade.

It is more heavily pigmented that typical drug store shades, but I have been spoiled by my Urban Decay Naked 2 palette, which contains eye shadow that has a consistency and pigmentation that is about as perfect as it gets!  The Japonesque shadow is not as good as the Urban Decay...but it is nice.

I think either a primer or (in my case) a lighter shade of cream eye shadow underneath is essential for shadow like this.  Put on alone, it will tend to fall off your lid, and you won't get the full benefit of it or its full color.

The case is very nice -- sturdy, elegant, well made.  It is not going to break when you're halfway done with the shadow...my pet peeve!  Overall, this is a very nice shadow, just falls a bit short of Urban Decay or MAC as far as the texture and pigmentation consistency.  But a little still goes a long way, so the darker color specifically will last a long time.",1
This is by far the best lotion I have ever used. Love the feel when it goes on and it works great.,1

"I have been anxiously waiting for this mascara to arrive in the mail,  I try mascara's all the time.  Since I've gotten older my eyelashes are not as thick as these to be. And when I was younger there are very thick and long and so I try mascara's all the time to get a little bit of that look back.  I  Didn't like it at all.  My eyelashes just clumped  together,  they didn't look thick at all and also my top and bottom eyelashes keep sticking together when I blink,  sometimes.  They also feel kind of stiff when I blink,  so I have a feeling,  taking it off,  is not going to be good.  I had high hopes,  but was very very disappointed.",0

"This seems as if made more for ""tan etching"" or shadowing.  I have had a maxi mist machine and thought I would try the St. Tropez- It takes at least 3 coats to even be able to see a noticeable difference- the mist is WAY too fine.  Not happy.  Only plus side is it's light if you are traveling but otherwise it's a lot of work for a faint tan.  The fan application is nice- you don't completely shiver and freeze while tanning.  Stay away- if you love St. Tropez spray tans then go to Nordstroms and get the real thing- don't be fooled- this is in no way the commercial grade St. Tropez spray tan you get at the spa.",0

Noticed a change in my complexion immediately.  Love love love this product!,1
"I received this product in my ipsy bag and fell in love with the product have purchased time and time again.

This moisturizer works equally well as a wake up in the morning as it does as a relax and wind down in the evening after a long hard day at work.

It's not extremely oily/moisturizing, I have to pump two or so pumps, but I think this is how it helps to not contribute to acne, because it's lightweight and not super heavy or oily. I like that's it's a glass pump bottle, glass is such better material than plastic, and the pump ensures nothing is contaminated inside with each use. The cooling effect is great. Really helps keep me less sweaty and oily throughout my day. Has greatly reduced the amount of oil my skin produces, even in the t-zone. No itching or irritation after using this, and my skin lets me know immediately if something bothers it. This is great for acne-prone, oily, congested skin just as they marketed it for.

Before you buy this product, there is one thing you need to understand: it clearly states that it is a cooling lotion. This should immediately prompt you to not put it near your eye area and also informs you that, yes, it will in fact have a cooling sensation. Those who are saying it is burning may have sensitive skin, or are just not used to an intense cooling sensation. So, please keep that in mind.

I found this to work amazing well, after sitting on the beach for a bit too long without reapplying sunscreen. Obviously I ended up with a nice sun burn. Applying this took the sting right out of my face, neck and chest areas. Since it worked on me so well, I applied it to all three kids faces/necks and chest as they also got a bit of sun too. None of them complained that it hurt or stung. They all loved the sensation they felt once applied.

Also, my husband works outside all day every day in the gas/oil industry and has super sensitive skin. 90% of the time his skin is super dry, the other 10% extremely OILY. Hes found this moisturizer to work well on his skin too. On days he has received too much sun, it really helps take the sting out of the burn. Since hes in direct sunlight and exposed to all weather elements such as wind all day, every day, his skin gets extremely dry and this is the ONLY moisturizer he will use.",1
"I figured I would give this a shot since I didn't want to spend a fortune on a moisture meter.  Nearly all of the ""name brand"" moisture meters cost as much or more then the majority of the power tools in my shop. You know, those things with motors, blades, bits, etc?  So I got this meter hoping it would just be average and give me semi accurate readings.  So much for that.  Every reading it gave me never went above 3%.  The majority read 1% or 0%, and this is reading woods like poplar, pine, and walnut.  When I purchased these woods they were measured to be about at 15% moisture content using a high end moisture meter.  Since purchasing they have been sitting in my shop which is humidity controlled to stay at 45% moisture content.  With that in mind, I'm fairly sure it is physically impossibly for any of the lumber to reach even 3% without further use of a kiln....much less 0%.

It is of course possible that I got a dud and others are more accurate, but why waste more time trying another meter or 4.  I'm going to look into the mini-ligno meters.  They appear to be reasonably priced and well reviewed.",0

"This vitamin C packed product is gentle in the face and smells fairly neutral. I'm not sure it is a miracle cure though. The main reason I reduced it by 1 star was because $20 for one fluid ounce is a bit steep in my book. However, if your face is really worth it, go for it.",1

I found AHAVA Dead Sea Salts at TJMaxx by accident (though I was wanting it anyway).  It's a 32 oz. container just as the one listed here for $9.99!!!

Great product.  Just as described.,1

I CALLED THE MANUFACTURE AND I SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER AND I SENT THEM PICTURES, THEY RESPONDED SAYING THAT THE BOTTLE THAT I BOUGHT MUST BE DMAGED AND THEY SENT ME A NEW ONE. I GAVE THEM A CHANCE AND I TRIED IT AGAIN AND OH LORD IT WAS JUST HORRIBLE!!!!!! I WENT AND I BOUGHT NEW BOTTLE FROM SALLY BEAUTY AND IT WAS THE SAME THING. THATS ITTTTTTTTTT. I AM NOT BUYING THIS RODUCT EVER AGAIN",0
"I usually use Bobbi Brown Perfectly Defined Gel Eyeliner in Steel Grey, which I love. I wanted to try this because I had heard that it was easier to apply and gave a nice cat eye. I had a hard time getting the Stila to apply to my eye at all. It is very light and I have to go over the area several times before you can even see it. I will stick with my Bobbi Brown!",0
My skin appears more soft and supple. Looks healthy and hydrated. Will buy again.,1

"Perfect, just what the wife wanted. Made her happy, makes me happy.",1
"So I buy a $20 product, and the moment I open it, a lot of it comes out.. why? Because it's shattered.
How do I use a fan brush on a shattered product? It picks up way too much.. there's no way to use it. Unless you want to try the pinterest/rubbing alcohol hack. But I paid $20 and I demand to get the product the same way as it's in the pictures.. or put a picture with the broken product.. maybe use the one I uploaded",0
Unsealed and poor packeging,0
They last a long time and it was a refreshing change from other mens soaps that I usually get at Walmart.,1
"This foundation stick is SO BAD! Not only do you get the most ridiculous amount of product (0.16 oz compared to the standard 1 oz), but the product itself is not good. I can not believe the price of this foundation for the amount of product you get. Absolutely do not spend your money on this. It is not high coverage like it says it is. I think it is about medium, and it is not buildable to full coverage. If you have acne or scarring to cover, this will not cover it. It kind of just sits on top of the skin and looks very unnatural and cakey. It somehow looks way better once my skin became extremely oily, but it also looked really cakey. I do not recommend this product to any skin type. I made a video applying this, so once I get that edited and uploaded I will update this review with the link so you guys can check it out if you're interested to see how it applies and looks on the skin.",0
I have waist length locs and my hair dries in about an hour. It isn't too loud and the hot setting is just perfect. Glad I purchased it.,1
It took forever to arrive. It's way pricey and nothing special. And who over designed the bottle-it barely functions and it's difficult to get the shampoo out.,0
"I was not impressed with this product. It did nothing at all for my hair. On a positive note, it does smell nice.",0
Have had my  NuBrilliance for over three years and have found it very effective. Easy to use and great results.,1
It drys your hair!,1
Couldn't have got this for a better price!!! My daughter loved how it had 4 different looks!,1
"Was too thin and light for me. Does not provide enough volume or hold. Has a nice clean texture.  Its easy to wash out, which is a bonus.  I was trying something different from my tried and true Crew Fiber, which provides much more volume, hold, and with zero shine.",0
it just soaks into your skin and keeps it hydrated all day even in negative below temps without feeling greasy. a big plus is that all shea butter products from L'Occitane are set up as a sustainable and fair trade partnership with the women who produce it in Burkina Faso.,1
Miracle worker!,1
"Not intended for dry skin, could find less expensive cream in the drug store.",0
Packaging was horrible. It was nearly impossible to remove the product out of the box as it was tightly secured with zip ties. So tight that no room was left to be able to cut them off causing scratches on the iron.  Very disappointing...,0
"again, was recommended to me but not at all what I hoped for....goes on thick and dries out leaving scaly hard cream if you're not careful when you apply it....not worth the $$",0
"I love this flat iron, but the first one only lasted about  a year.  I sent it in under warranty (with $35 fee to get a replacement) and within a year, it has died again.  All of the other reviews are correct.  There is no rhyme or reason to it.  It just dies one day out of the blue.  I paid $189 for my original one so that is a pretty extensive investment to be having this many issues.",0
"Yes, I do have fine hair.  That being said, I used a kitchen thermometer to measure the heat coming off the curling iron and it was nearly 100 degrees hotter than it was supposed to be on the low end.  Clearly the thermostat on the curling iron is bad.",0
"This is an okay straightener. It warms up pretty quickly, it goes smoothly thru my hair and is fairly light weight. It also comes with good directions and professional style hair clips to section off your hair while styling it.

That being said, it doesn't do as good a job as other straighteners that I've used (Bedhead and Chi are the two I use most frequently). I have fine hair that is curly and frizzes easily, so it isn't too much of a challenge to straighten normally. I wouldn't suggest this for hair that is really difficult to straighten as it just doesn't seem powerful enough for that.",1
"Very helpful customer service! I opened the package and the polish smashed on the floor, and they sent a new one within days! Very nice and I love this color. Goes on smooth, and lasts without chipping.",1
'Disappointed.  This smells nothing like any of the Devines Momo products I've used. It actually smelled like fish n plastic. 'Returning.,0
"This is a good color for me and provides great coverage.
Even in an emergency when I don't have much if any time to put any makeup on ~ I'll put a little concealer under my eyes and this tinted moisturizer on my face and I'm good to go!",1
"This straightener is not good by any stretch.  I am a babyliss fan, and this one was terrible! spend an extra $20-$30 and get one that works well!!!",0
Ridiculously small amount for the price,0
I just started using this product 2 weeks ago after having my baby girl via cesarean. So far I've noticed my belly feels soft & my lose skin is getting firm again. I'll definitely keep using it!,1
"NOT AT ALL AS PICTURED.  This is not the original metal compact produced by Stila. I ordered this to replace the one I have had for over a decade.  I received a cheap plastic version of a Stila compact. If you are expecting the silver metal version as pictured, you will be disappointed.",0
Could not fit my blow dryer. Sucks!,0
Really works,1
"This shaving brush looks great - on the shelf.  Trying to use it presents a challenge however.  The slick surfaced handle a bit short and is hard to hang onto if your hand is wet.  That problem could probably be fixed by making the surface crosscut or pebbled.
 I have been using shaving brushes for 50 years and was hoping this low priced brush would replace my previous brush which was dropped and broken after 20 years of use.  Still looking.",0
Didn't really work for my hair.,0
"This is the best conditioner in the history of conditioners. If you're looking for the best conditioner, scroll back up and buy this. Just do it. I know it's expensive, but it's so worth it. Like SO worth it.",1
"I trust this brand and while I haven't had the product long enough to give any feedback on long-term results, I will definitely be updating my review as time goes on.

Usually with a good eye cream you can feel it working right away, as is the case with this product. Ten minutes after putting it on I still felt the ""tightening"" feeling under and around my eyes. While there have been no drastic changes as of yet puffiness was definitely reduced and the reduction of the bags under my eyes from a lack of sleep the other night was definitely noticeable.

While you can feel it working on your skin there is no residue feeling, which is a huge plus since I don't like heavy creams on my skin.

I will update my review later with long-term results but so far so good. Until I see the long-term results I can't say if it's worth the money or not, but if first impressions are any indication it very well may be.",1
"Bought this curling iron in May and it just stopped working 5 months later from one day to another. The light turns on, but it doesn't heat up. I've bought other brands and I still have them and they still work. 4-5 months lifespan is not good at all. Especially when you don't use it every day.",0
"got what I ordered
hasn't changed or helped the problem
gave it a try
wont order again
took a chance and",0
This product cleans and smells well enough and a little goes a long way. I have not been using it long enough to be able to tell if it is helping to stimulate hair growth or not but I have hope. Will update review in the future with any updates.,1
I had one of these for two weeks. The battery died with in this time frame. Though I loved the clean it gave my skin I could not remove the screws thats covered where the battery was located. I contacted customer support via email and received a response 5 days later telling me to remove the screws I couldn't remove. A filler had been used to seal to screws in that prevented a screw driver from removing them. Ended up having to throw it away.,0
"Very difficult to get out of the tube and the hard plastic when rubbing onto your chapped lips is not gentle.  Love the ingredients however,",0
"This seems like a different formula than the one I bought in store. The tan one on the left is the one I bought in store, and the pink one on the right is the one from Amazon. It smells the same but it's thicker and has zero shimmer like the one I bought in store. Learned my lesson on buying it online I guess.",0
"This product absorbs moisture and is helpful for no shower days.  However it
is imprecise to apply and on dark hair looks like dandruff.",0
Love this product.  Purchased my first one at salon when I got a manicure.  Now have one for home and office.,1
"I don't think it's authentic. I tried this cologne at the store. And the one I bought here doesn't smell the same. When I tried it on the store, the smell of the cologne was in my arm the whole day. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm not sure it's authentic.",0
Great iron. Love the comb. Nice and low  profile.,1
I'm not sure what is different about this top coat but the instructions for the polish said it is only supposed to be used with the matching top coat so I bought it.,1
Good,1
"This conditioner is terrible.  It detangles ok, but doesn't soften hair at all.  Left my ends feeling very dry.  I had to use my Bonacure leave-in spray conditioner to make it soft.  Definitely won't buy this again.",0
Arrived on time with four different samples! Great!,1
Love it! It was recommended to me by my friend who is a makeup artist. Light coverage for everyday wear and love the luminosity it gives bed to my face! My face doesnt feel greasy wearing it which can happen with tinted moisturisers sometimes. I even wear my normal moisturiser under it.,1
"The color was a perfect match to what I was looking for and very please with the application and the wand absorbs just the right amount of lip gloss for each application.

It is not a use once and you do not need to reapply the rest of the day, as it does wear off but there is no indication of this on the packaging so it was not expected.

It stands up nicely on the makeup table, dresser, etc. and fits into your purse with ease so you can reapply as needed but I did have some product issues

The problem I did have though was after 10 application the top of the container broke apart from the applicator creating quite the mess.  I was not sure if this occurred in shipping or was a manufacturing defect.  It is still usable however you have to apply with care as there is not adapter piece to provide the proper amount of lip gloss for use.",1
"While I could see where this work for fine, straight hair, it definitely didn't work for my curly hair at all.",0
Not working for me.,0
"I absolutely love this lamp!! They use this same one at my nail place and it's amazing! I bought one because I like to do my own nails here and there and I wanted to get a better lamp than the cheapy UV lamp I got from Sally's (although it cost me $60.00 it was a crappy piece of junk!)

I like to do hard gels with tips and with this LED lamp, OMG the curing time is soooooo much quicker and really cures the gels hard and sturdy.

I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner as it is a pricey gel lamp and you want to know what you're doing g. But if you have the money and want to learn then go for it!",1
"I bought this product because a friend of mine swore by it, and it had decent reviews. For me, it just didn't work out. I found that using one full size towel was pushing it, barley enough. I cut the towel in half and tried to do my lower body with one half and then my upper body with the other. The color developed by the next day (did this before bed) but it was pretty streaky and very orange in color. Not for me. It looks awesome on my friend but I guess my skin type just doesn't work with this formula. I gave it 2 stars because it is a convenient idea, and I have seen it look great on other people. Also, there is no color guard..so you cant see where you are putting it. For me, that is a must!",0
It works great but the nozzle end gets so hot you could easily be burned.,1
Just not at all what i wanted,0
ordered wig,0
I've only used once. It is very relaxing and my skin felt moisturized after using it. I'll come back and give more results when I have used it again.,1
"I have only used this once and don't know anything about its effectiveness yet, but the jar was almost a third of the way empty when I opened it.  It's not that expensive, but still, I feel kind of cheated for not getting a jar that was actually full.",0
Adorable - just slightly big for a 2 year old but definitely something we'll grow into,1
"They sent the wrong item  -- not this easy to use tube, but a cream that was a messy hassle. The color, which I tried to carefully select with the dermablend guide online had a weird almost purple tint when it went on, and made it look like a had a massive bruise. Returned it and won't be trying dermablend again; this is the 2nd time their product disappointed.",0
"Item description is for Infusiun 23 hair product, not Tan Towel exfoliator.",0
"This works well for my baby's sensitive skin. It is not as thick as other brands and seems to have more of the protecting ointment as well as the zinc.

I use this at bedtime since she is in one overnight diaper all night. It does a good job of keeping her rash free.

I like this product and will continue to use it!",1
Managed to grab this palette while it was on sale on Amazon a week ago. Not sure how and why but I did. The only palette you'll need in your life I'd say!,1
"This cream smells amazing and works great.  It makes my hair super soft and protects it against flat ironing.  The best product I've ever used.  You have to try it.  Also, I got this cream over 6 months ago and I'm still on my first bottle.  I only use it in the morning when I get out of the shower, but it has lasted a long time.  Worth the price!",1
Rating explains,0
"Arrived fast, well packaged; works beautifully! Thank you",1
"I would give this product even less than a star.............I have registed in the website that waa pure waste of time to activate the device which has nothing to do with the device itself. The company tricky way for you to register online and create an account with them.

Well the worse thing is that Im still having trouble activating this thing...........i have tried and tried and tried and got frustrated. I followed the instruction in details many time step by step yet failed to activate it. Now, it is just sitting there for me to figure soemthing out.",0
Not Good,0
It came pretty quick.  I was a little suprised that there weren't even instructions on how to use the product.  I went to the website to find out how to use it.  So far my razor bumps seem to not be coming up so that is a good thing.,1
It's great,1
"Wow, really?! This has the consistency of a soft blanket. When I wet it and tried to take off my eye makeup I thought I might emerge with a few more wrinkles! It pulls so much on the eyes and is not effective at removing eye makeup. I wouldn't even let my 13 year old daughter use it. Maybe my small dog will like to cuddle with it. =\",0
A very tiny bottle for twenty dollars and does nothing but dry the area up. I've been applying it on my occasional cyst that I get and it has not reduced the size. It doesn't work. Save your money this stuff isn't cheap.,0
this came quick and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this color!!,1
"Color was cotton candy, ""Mommy"" Pink. Not what I expected. It looked ridiculous and not at all like the color chart - even accounting for how different monitors can change a color, this stuff was like I'd shellacked liquid shiny bubble gum on my mouth.",0
"This product is fraudulent! As others have stated, the product has different packaging than the real product and causes more severe irritations. Really think twice before you purchase this product because your eyes and the skin around your eyes are extremely sensitive.

You don't want to be applying harsh chemicals that haven't been approved and regulated.",0
I love it! Super Refreshing!,1
"I was very annoyed to buy the product from this seller, because the product is not true, it's a cheap falsification. I was very sorry to have purchased this product from him. And I want to warn everyone that this product is not true, is any oil, but is not the MOCORRANOIL therefore do not have the texture, smell and even the same power as the real has. DO NOT BUY THIS FAKE",0
"Works very nicely, skin feels smoother and good size",1
"My dermatologist promised this would work miracles on my dark circles, but I have seen no improvement at all.  It seems like a good eye cream, but no better than the eye creams I usually use.  For the price, it was a huge disappointment.

Pros:
Emollient eye cream
Moisturizer temporarily helps small lines

Cons:
Does nothing for dark circles
No better than most eye creams
Expensive",0
"after about 3 weeks of using it, it started making my nails brittle",0
"I was really hoping this serum would work.  I've been trying to switch to organic products after using harsher acne treatments for years.  This actually made my face produce more oil.  I have breakouts now across my forehead, a place a never broke out in the past.
For my oily skin I need something stronger I guess.  I've gone back to ProActiv, it is clearing my skin very quickly, but, as I've experienced in the past, it tends to be very drying.",0
Mouthwash container was delivered cracked and mouthwash spilled all over.  Such a shame.  Would not purchase a liquid again.,0
"Gentle, great smell and lasts forever! I cut each bar into quarters to make it easier to handle. 2 bars lasted me almost an entire year bathing once daily.",1
too greasy ...would never use it during the day,0
The color is strange -- orangey,0
"Not the same color as the original. I ordered Funny Bunny and the one I received is a much whiter shade than the original, which is more of an off-white color.",0
"One of the worst hair building fibers out there. Stay as far away from these as you would from rotten fish! They don't adhere to the hair as the company claims, and the black color is actually not black at all. It is a gray/dusty color that's just horrible. I have used almost all brands of hair thickening fibers and trust me, these are the absolute worst. Don't waste your money, get something else.",0
"Bought this curling iron for my girlfriend and boy did she look great after using it! Usually her curls go flat by the time we leave the house but after she used this curling iron, her hair was so curly and bouncy the whole day through. Great product!",1
Doesn't really add a lot to the thickness of my hair but has great holding.,1
"After initially applying this to my lips I immediately really felt the irritation.
I finally had to go to a dermatologist after several days of using this product and the damage to my lips and it caused,
The doctor put me on a high level of Cortizone topical for my labs which was unpleasant as self but finally healed my lips a little bit.
When I called the company to complain they offered no refund or any other recourse that just stop using the product immediately,
I've learned just because something is expensive doesn't mean it's going to be helpful at work for you.",0
"My stylist uses this hairdryer on my hair when I get it done. I broke down and bought one, even though I already have a good T3 hair dryer. Great dryer. I like it better than my T3. It dries my hair fast, makes it smooth, and is super light. I would buy this again!",1
"Not totally in love with the texture it leaves.  Smells great, and seems to protect the hair.  In combination with leave-in, I love it!",1
I just made the decision to start taking better care of my face. A friend recommended trying Anthony's facial products so I went for it. After shaving I typically run out the door and don't think twice about it. I was able to feel the difference in my face after using this aftershave. After using these products I might not look like a 65 year old man in my mid-30s.,1
"the razor gets oily and hairs stick inside, water won't clean the razor, had to use soap, what a mess!
i might use this oil for massage or something else",0
"Factory seal had already been broken,first red flag,very thick a lot of very drying detergent was put in place of original product,second red flag
Been using this wash for 20 plus years and this is the first time I have seen this wash the way it is...I have had out dated wash before and when I used them the product was nothing like this..Will stick to buying anything to do with the face from a trusted authorized dealer,so you know what you are getting.",0
"It did not work at all... I spent up to 3 hours trying to straighten my hair. I don't have kinky curls and my hair is not difficult! The straightener gets super hot and turns itself off... I keep having to turn it back on. Even when it's at it's highest heat, it's not working on my hair. I must have wound up with one that doesn't work properly or maybe it's a fake. I saw many other reviews stating that they received used/fake babyliss straighteners from this seller. Sucks that I lost $100. I tried using it 4 times and it never improved.

I'm incredibly disappointed. It took me so long to realize I have a fraud or something is just wrong that it's now too late for me to return it.

I don't have money to just throw around and now won't be able to have straight hair for probably another year since I can't afford to buy another.",0
"I have long dense hair.  Styling my hair is always a gargantuan task. However, this rotating hair brush is a God-sent because it is that freaking good! The metal barrel polishes your hair to give it a shine. You can use it to give you the gentle loose waves or curls.

A few tips:

Tip 1) : Always apply oil on your hair and scalp before you wash it. Even if it is only for half hour, do it. You will hear you hair whisper 'thank you ' in your ears all day.  To help wash the oil in the shower, use a thin paste of chick-pea flour to rinse out the oil . And then shampoo and condition. Apply your leave-in oil/serum. Let air dry more than half way thru and then use the styler.

Tip 2) :  Hold the tip of your hair while you use the brush's rotating function and glide the brush down towards the tip of your hair and let the tip go only when you know there's not enough hair to entangle in the brush.  Else, if you have long hair like me, you might end up with a mess of entangled hair.

Tip 3) First run the rotating brush on one side of your sectioned hair, and then always follow with another run on the other side of the sectioned hair . Let me explain. Imagine your sectioned hair is like a ribbon. The ribbon has two sides , ya ? Now run the rotating hair brush on the inside of the ribbon. Usually on the inside , I do clockwise rotation of the brush. Now , don't stop there. On the outside of the ribbon, run the rotating brush in the opposite direction, usually anti-clockwise,  Thats how you achieve a frizz free silky smooth styled hair. This might be very basic for a lot of ppl, but I thought someone might find the tip  useful.

Tip 4): If it does get entangled, don't panic. Reduce the temp using the temp setting. Get the brush to rotate in the other direction( opposite direction of whatever direction the brush was  in when the hair got entangled). The brush should let go.",1
Great color!  I got so many compliments on it.,1
"Only loses a star as the scent is pretty strong.  My skin usually reacts poorly to heavily scented soaps and oils so it took me quite awhile to get accustomed to the smell. I still cringe once and awhile with worry that my skin will break out later...

That being said I purchased this while staying in France for two months. (I actually bothered to risk bringing it back with me as I didn't want to leave it behind. I've now been using it for almost a year)

It's amazing. My skin is extremely sensitive and I have issues with dryness (Around face, elbows, calves) which I have had since I was a teenager (I'm now very much not a teenager).  This is the first cleansing product that does not cause me to need to heavily moisturize after the shower. I can actually get away with NOT using moisturizer until the next day if I really want. It's incredible.  The scent doesn't seem to cause break outs (even if my brain just doesn't like it) and it saves me money.  You don't need too terribly much per usage... and what you'll save in moisturizer will make this product more than free if you're like me.",1
I've ordered this product in the past and never had a problem. This time it had a sour scent to it.,0
"Great solar protection, difficult to wash off.",1
Product is as described.,1
"I have been using this for a couple weeks now along with all the other products for my face. This products directions say to apply after the wash and toner. I have been washing and then using a firm and lift from Erno and then this. I have noticed a bit of lightening but not as much as I thought with a 130$ product. I would show before and after pictures but they don't look much different. It comes out of a pump that lets out a very small amount. You only need a tiny squirt. A little goes a long way. It has a lotion like feeling on your face, very silky. It smells really fresh and very light in smell and feel. I am going to come back to this review after I have used this or a couple of months and let you all know how it goes.",1
"I've been using this cream since it came out and it's absolutely incredible! I switch between the regular and extra rich in the Summer vs. Winter. My skin is extremely sensitive and stubborn, yet 37 Actives always calms it without fail. As someone who spends a good amount of time doing outdoor sports and is also forgetful, it's important that a moisturizer have SPF but won't weigh my skin down and cause breakouts. 37 Actives is the only cream that fits that bill! I highly reccomend this cream to everyone of any skin type, it's a miracle cream. When people ask why my skin looks so good, I direct them to 37 Actives.",1
"I had been using the Klorane spray dry shampoo, but I changed to this because of its non-toxic ingredients.  I use it often, at least once a week.  This goes on pretty white, but I can brush it in fairly easily, but I have blonde hair.  Not sure it would work as well on a brunette.  Has a strong lemony scent, but it dissipates for the most part by the time I get to work.  I plan on buying again once I run out of this bottle.",1
"You need to use a good moisturizer before applying it. It can turn a little ""chalky"" without applying moisturizer first.",1
Works great with my skin. Love epicuren!,1
My hair does seem fuller,1
"I have purchased Mario Badescu products in the past.

This Seaweed Cleansing Soap, I didn't like the scent, I felt like I was putting a salad on my face, which I didn't like the little pieces in the cleansing soap, plus it really left my skin feeling clean, but overly clean, stripped, not feeling soft.

They say on the bottle that it's suitable for all skin types, which is kind of subjective to me.  Yes I want my face to feel clean when Iam using a cleansing product, but I don't like it feeling stripped. This also left my facial skin looking red, which really surprised me.  Not sure if Iam allergic to an ingredient in it or not.

Live and learn!",0
these are so cute! love the scrubs and smells great!,1
"I keep trying various oils but my sensitive skin has revolted against almost every single one.  FINALLY with this oil my skin is behaving and drinking it up.  It's lightly moisturizing and has evened out my skin tone.

If you have sensitive skin, I definitely recommend checking this out to test and see if your skin will behave with this one.  I'm still quite shocked how well it has done for me!",1
I do not wish to comment.,1
Wish this had been around when I was in my twenties.  It is wonderful.  My arms are almost smooth and smoother than they have ever been in my life!  Too bad it cost so much but it is worth it to have smooth skin.,1
"All it did was make my hair feel gritty, tangled and rough, did not add volume.",0
Works great!,1
Had read it would be helpful for thinning hair.  Did not find it helpful at all.,0
"This gel is too watery. It's not thick and will not hold thick, Asian hair types.",0
nice,1
This not only helps prevent chap lips it also gives my lips some color.,1
"I was so excited to try this self-tanner! Unfortunately, when I dispensed the product to apply it, it had a green color. I immediately called the manufacturer and asked if this was normal. They said it was not, and the green color is due to oxidation from not being stored properly. They suggested I return it advising that it might not work properly.",0
"The only reason I am giving this 4, instead of 5 stars, is that it's a real pity that it contains just 2,5% niacinamide, and not 5%.",1
"At this price Marvis toothpaste is definitely a guilty pleasure, but one that I've been routinely indulging in as of late.  As previous reviewers mentioned, unlike the normal shelf stuff, Marvis just tastes great and leaves a fresh feeling in the mouth.  I actually look forward to brushing my teeth every morning and evening.  While not a must have, it's certainly nice to try.",1
"VBS beauty can not back up their shipping, recieved half empty bottle, tough luck to bad, Lost my hard earned money with these folks, Go to your local store and purchase full bottle, this company is a rip off!",0
True to its name. I was hoping it would be abrasive and scrubby after reading the reviews.,0
"I love BB creams so I was really excited to try this. When I first got it, I was thinking, wow that's really dark. Then I noticed on the back the color says Latte. Does that mean they make more than one color? Did I get a dark color without thinking? I was hesitant to try this because it was so dark but I figured, hey, I want to see if it will help my legs with some color and to hide any imperfections I have. Applying it with a makeup sponge was fairly easy. It blended out really well but the color was just not me.

Not to mention the makeup was rubbing off on my clothing. The top of my white socks were covered. I actually felt more self-conscious going out with my legs covered in make-up than I did with them just super white. I have 3 BB creams at home so I didn't bother using this on my face because of the color.",0
"I have used this product for years and THIS one is definitely a FAKE. The smell was awful! Normally this shampoo has the clean tea tree smell, but this one honestly smell like you are in an animal barn. It smells like manure! I've totally broken out since using it too. It does not deserve even the one star I have to give it. Buyer Beware!",0
Bought as a gift for my husband after he completely ran out of all cologne ( even the Old Spice standby!). Delivery was speedy and the package arrived well packed with the contents protected. He (and I) love the scent...and who doesn't feel better when you know you smell gooood !,1
Would not recommend this for people with oily skin. It make my face look and feel like one giant oil slick.,0
"Despite the rave reviews this gets, for me it was too mattifying. Made my skin itch also.",0
Make my hair nice and silky! My hair has bounce and  shine. I love it so far.,1
Cheap microbeads. I returned.,0
Great product and this was larger than I can find at beauty supply stores. Great price too.,1
I love this! It takes off all makeup even eye makeup. Just wish the packaging was better as I lost some trying to soak the cotton pads while Turing the bottle upside down,1
"I was sent the Nice palette but when you look on the picture it only shows the Naughty palette. I specifically wanted the Naughty palette because the box art is a lot nicer, if i would have known they were going to send a random palette that has nothing to do with the picture i would not have bought it in the first place. False advertising. I'm disappointed.",0
Pulled and broke my hair. Don't buy the hype. I only used a few times and now it just sits in my misfit hair product box,0
Love this product.,1
"I'm not a teen, haven't been for many years, but I still get breakouts. These breakouts are primarily on my chin but I used this toner all over my face. I started with once a day since my skin in sensitive and I didn't want to dry it out. The results were noticeable, with the breakout I had clearing up and no others popping up.

So far, I haven't needed to increase to more than once a day. I use it at night, then moisturize like I normally do. Good results.",1
waste of money. Smells good though.,0
this is camphor phenique and rubbing alcohol,0
"Disappointed in this product.  I thought it would hold my hair, it does not.  The number 8 Lanza holds better.",0
"I've used other types of acne products and sprays, but this has been the most effective on the acne on my back.  Other than the fumes and strong alcohol smell, this product is very good.  I'm on my 2nd bottle.",1
curls much better than drugstore curlers...,1
Items came broken and opened,0
"My husband loves colognes like ""Happy"" by Clinique, so this was a perfect cologne for him!  It's very citrusy and light, and does wear off quickly, but smells really good on him.  we also purchased another JV fragrance and loved it too.",1
Great prduct and price delievered to the door,1
"Loved the product, but it stopped working 3 months after purchased.",0
Doesn't work as advertised,0
Did not clean the makeup thoroughly,0
Not great like they advertise Very poor. Did not heat up to 396 degrees at all..,0
Great Christmas type smell. Have not lit it yet because would be very disappointed to see same amount of smoke like Stonehenge candle. Also flame seems to twice as high as other candles. Safety factor.,0
"The color was nice, but it by no means stayed on like it was supposed to. I was unimpressed after one cup of coffee.",0
OLD stock.  Wrinkled during the curing process on several retries.,0
Didn't work for me will go back to gel manicures at the salon.,0
Product met my expectations.,0
Great product.  It makes my skin look and feel like silk.  I will absolutely buy this again.,1
Not an authentic product. Threw it away. Had a strange yellow tint and not returnable.,0
"First, the item arrived with a crack in the jar and had leaked all over. To my surprise the pads inside the jar were still wet enough to use so I tried it. It leaves my skin feeling greasy, which I don't care for. I think 20% is a great place to start if you've never used glycolic acid before, or if you want to add it to your daily routine. I will not reorder these. I will look for another brand at 20% for daily use.",0
It's o.k. Like the feel of the product on my face.  Very sheer.,1
"Good product, really lasts without chipping.  This color is lovely.  Mauvey with a gold shimmer.",1
I'm happy to see more pastels and shimmer free colors being available in the CND brand.  My Cake Pop arrived in in appropriate sized packaging(padded envelope) and arrived in good condition. The consistency of the polish was fine too (not thick or runny).,1
I love the way is makes my hair feel and  it smells great.  This is the secret to making my hair shiny and super smooth!  I love it paired with the 44 Iron Guard.,1
Absolutely love this product! It works very well. I've tried many vitamin C creams and this works the best,1
"Do not use!! Before using this product I had combination skin, very healthy, and relatively clear. I had issues with small bumps on my face and the occasional white head. I wanted to use this product so that it could boost my complexion and make my skin glow more. However upon using it I found that it caused my skin to be EXTREMELY dry. After awhile the skin on my cheeks began to wrinkle and flake and peel. After noticing this I immediately stopped using the product but it left my skin very irritated and that irritation caused post inflammatory hyperpigmentation on my face and my complexion is now 4-5 shades darker than it originally was. If I could give this product 0 stars I would. It's been about a month and a half after using and my skin is still very dark and my complexion is very patchy and uneven.",0
"This is the best hairdryer that I have owned, it doesn't leave my hair frizzy and is easy to handle, and dries my long hair quickly as well. It was lighter in weight than I expected based on other reviews I had read.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.",1
Didnt' like the flat matte appearance. otherwise product was fine.,0
Delivered as promised,1
This didn't make me any darker.  I followed the directions perfectly and left on for the maximum amount of time and i did not get any tanner.,0
"I first learned about ELEMIS Frangipani Oil on an NCL cruise ship.  After an amazing ELEMIS scrub, the spa service provider applied this oil!  My skin glowed and was the softest it has been for years!  When I found it on AMAZON, I immediately bought it and treat myself to this about 3-4 times a week. An amazing product!",1
"This is the first nail polish that doesn't peel off my nails within 24 hours of application.  While it doesn't last 7 days one me (I didn't expect it would) it does last 3-4 days, plus it is super easy to apply.  Big FAN!",1
"I'm a fan of long-lasting Vinylux Polish. When I use it, I generally get close to a week's wear, sometime less, but when I take it to my manicurist, it can last up to 10 days. I really prefer this over shellac because it is so easy to remove at home with inexpensive lacquer polish remover. And my nails are never damaged from it. Just remember that when you use Vinylux Polish, you should also be using the Vinylux topcoat that is part of the system.  This color is really pretty, although a bit shinier than I really like.  Seller shipped quickly and it arrived before the estimated date.",1
My wife has been using this for a t least a year. She keeps it in the clear tube it comes in. If she is happy then this is a good thing.,1
Great product!,1
"I have very thick, coarse, frizzy hair.  I use a curling iron to straighten, tame the cuticle, then add curl back. I've been using another drugstore brand for years, and thought it was time to move a step up.  What a disappointment. I need high heat for this to work on my hair.  This is supposed to go to 430 degrees, and there is no way that is happening.  I can still touch the barrel when it is on the highest setting. It gets lukewarm, and that's about it.  I had to hold each curl for 45-60 seconds to get any kind of smoothing or curling.  And, the switch kept turning off all by itself.  I think I got a defective product, but the packaging is so complicated that there is no way I can repackage it to send it back. I feel like I just flushed my money down the toilet.  I bought this in two sizes. This one is 1"", the other is 1-1/4 inches.  I have not opened the 1-1/4"", and now I'm sort of afraid to.  I'm thinking maybe I should just return it unopened.  Not sure what to do. Maybe I should try it. I also bought a flat iron, same brand, that is supposed to go to 430 degrees, and that works great.",0
Leaves my hair dry and frizzy.,0
Great product!  I have been using it fir years & rate it a 5 star!,1
This has a decent fresh scent and a light suds but it is loaded with chemical ingredients and it dries out the skin.,0
"I liked this scent much more than I expected to, as I normally prefer earthy, spicy scents. This has a soft, fresh, clean scent without being cloyingly sweet. There is a hint of flowers, but it's just the right amount. My only disappointment is that the scent is GONE within two hours.",1
I bought this for my step daughter.  Big fan of Laura Geller products. I would say better than smash box,1
If u have smooth/hydrated skin this is perfect!! (I say smooth/hydrated because the first few times I used this product my skin was very dry it didn't apply smoothly it did after i moisturized) offers good coverage and WOW the color choice for pale skin like mine was spot on!!! Neck finally matched face  only two issues I had : very thick so hard to apply evenly and have to use moisturizer first bfor applying which is strange since this is supposed to be a moisturizer ... Thats what only 3.5 real stars but they didn't have that option so I rated it 4 star ...,1
No obvious change in skin after a year of use.,0
Seriously? Worst top coat I have ever used... colored polish was dried completely for 24 hours... smeared and ruined my paint job! Shouldn't even get 1 star... pretty sad that Dollar Tree top coat is better than this!,0
I love this product.  I can't wear most scented products.  But the natural scents used in this product do not bother my allergies.  Really a nice product.,1
"Very nice product! It s like conditioner that works not deep in hair, but it gives smooth , shine, thick effect. Five stars!",1
Matches my Coke can.,1
Beware the size of this product. I didn't pay enough attention. At this size and this price it is a complete rip off!,0
"My sense is this stuff works and, on at least me, better than other products.",1
I may just be stupid but I can curl my hair fine with a flat iron. I thought I'd get this to add variety to the curls but it does not work. I have watched videos and tried everything. It does not work unless I keep it on my hair for an insane amount of time. Takes a long time to curl and does not get too hot though I burn my fingers often on it. Would not buy again or suggest.,0
"I initially bought the 2"" version, but as soon as I took a look at it I knew it was too big, so I sent it back for the 1 1/2"" and the size is perfect for getting nice big, soft mermaid waves.  I love that it gets really hot, really fast.  I've had problems in the past with other curling and flat irons not getting really hot or only for a couple weeks of use, but that's not the case here.  This gets my thick coarse hair smooth and shiny as silk, and never sticks or snags.  I would definitely buy it again.",1
I feel like it hurt my nails too strong and very hard to clean,0
"This is the 2nd babyliss pro I have owned.  I loved my first one.  This one that I ordered and received stopped working properly.  The heat control isn't functioning right it just keeps heating and blew a fuse in my bathroom.  The first time I noticed it fried a section in my hair as well.

I am writing this review because I am being given no option to exchange for a functioning iron by seller or Amazon. I really just want to exchange for one that works. Pricey equipment to not give an exchange option when it is faulty. :-(",0
Has a really nice and refreshing taste. It smells really nice and leaves a nice flowery scent to your breath. Also makes my teeth feel really clean.,1
I like this face washing machine. Its really helpful.,1
Absolutely wonderful!,1
"I'm a nail polish fanatic and was so excited when I heard about this polish but have been very disappointed with it.  It had leaked in the packaging making it difficult to open, which was not a good start.  I painted my toes with it and I live at the beach and am in the sand a lot and it was chipped the next day.  I then decided to try it on my fingernails, only to be disappointed once again.  I painted them with no topcoat since it claims to be a weekly polish on its own, but the next day most of my nails were significantly chipped.  Soooo disappointed in this product :(",0
"Vichy Id&eacute;al Capital Soleil Autobronzant Moisturizing Self Tanner Lotion for Face and Body with Vitamin E works well over time. It is spring and the long sunless winter must come to an end.  For people everywhere, but especially those covered up all season with ""whiter than white"" legs, shorts are distressing first thing out.  For me, self-tanners provide enough color to allow wearing shorts without embarrassment of snow white legs, while letting me outside starting to get some sun on those same legs.

Having tried mousses, creams, and thinner spray products, with and without ""guide"" color--I have preferences.  First preference, less cream with drier application.  Second preference, low fragrance. Third, enough DHA concentration to push the first application on the skin to a retained color without relying on the color that literally washes away.  If you have never used these types of products, the longer you can leave it one before you wash it off, the more color you may retain.  As for color, in these products, DHA is the active ingredient and it usually is retained as a brown-orange color on lighter skin types.  If there is added color, and you choose to keep the product on without washing, then that might be a factor in your own product selection.  (In that category, I really like the Fake Bake products, thin consistency but high DHA and lots of brown colorant).

Vichy Id&eacute;al Capital is a cream.  It can go on thick and remain sticky depending on how much you apply.  Too much and it will stay moist.  Just enough and it dries to stay on longer for better retention.  It does not have any added color, so it will not be immediately obvious until later how much tan color you may have retained. The fragrance is OK, not overwhelming, and it does seem to subside over hours, although not totally.

On the first application, I was a bit disappointed with the amount of color provided after letting it stay on about 8 hours then washing it off in a shower.  The second application provided a bit more color. From my experience with other tanners I would say the concentration of DHA is average, not providing a quick tan, and requiring an additional next day application.

Cost wise, and accounting for the amount of product required for coverage on legs alone, I was able to use the given amount about 5 times over a period of weeks.  For retention and continuation of the tan color you need to put it on (and let it stay on for a number of hours) about every 3-4 days.

All of these products say you can put them on your face, although I would hesitate about doing that without trying some on your hands first.  It is not so much about skin sensitivity (and the Vichy Id&eacute;al Capital did not irritate my skin at all, as they indicate) but strange or inconsistent color.  Inherently a cream will provide easier and more consistent coverage than a thinner liquid product, but still-- try it on the top of your hands or upper arms first to see if you like the color that might be retained on your face. (I prefer no face application).

So how does Vichy Id&eacute;al Capital self tanner stack up.  I would give it 4/5, mostly due to ease of application and how it feels after it has been on a while.  Minus a star for perceived lower DHA concentration and slower tan development.

Vichy Id&eacute;al Capital Soleil Autobronzant Moisturizing Self Tanner Lotion can ease the transition to comfortable display of winter legs to summer short weather.  If you have never used a self-tanner this is a good one, and worth a try, especially if you have tried other products.",1
Smells like mens cologne. Would not recommend this product for women.,0
Product smells old. I've purchased Rituals before direct and it has a lovely fragrance. This particular bottle doesn't have the same texture or smell.,0
"If you have thick hair, this is the flat iron you need. I was a little skeptical of the price, but man, this thing is worth every penny and it doesn't mess around! This will sound strange, I know, but it actually works TOO well for my hair. I have a graduated bob and had been using the CHI, which worked well but one plate stopped working (twice) so I gave up on that brand. The Babyliss is great, but I'm missing the body I used to keep with my CHI. This iron works so well, it flattens the hair and makes it bone straight, which might be what you're looking for... but for my bob, it left it slick with no body.
Overall, if you have long, thick hair and are seeking a sleek, flat look, this iron is for you. If you have a shorter style, this might not be a good match.",1
I've used this product for years and really like it.  It has a nice weight and absorbs well.  I like that it has a SPF.,1
"This is really great! When I use the metal eyelash curlers, I end up digging them into my face practically to get all the lashes - I really do have a red mark next to my nose bridge many times - and I don't have to do that with this one. It's very easy to get all the lashes, BUT I have to agree that because the curler is black (as well as the sponge thing), it's hard to see my lashes. I would recommend getting the pink one (I think I've seen it on Amazon) - and that's what I'm going to do now. Perhaps because it's plastic and therefore more fragile, my curler's handle broke on one side. Maybe I'm really strong...? Or threw my curler down somewhere? I don't know but I have to buy a new one now, but I definitely am not sad to be spending this money....",1
Awesome!,1
so far is ok now,1
This works well for removing make up.  I had to use three cotton balls with this cleanser to get every trace of foundation off my face.  I like this cleansing water but wills stick with my usually routing of a foaming cleanser as it actually saves me more time in the long run and is cheaper than using a cleaning water.,1
I ordered 4 bottles and one was broken. What a mess. I won't order nail polish again.,1
Great razor. Made very well looks great and also gives nice shave. One word of advice GET THE LONG HANDLE. You will not regret it.,1
Not great,0
Coverage not quite as good as earlier product.,1
I was very excited to try this but so disappointed. It burned while it was on so much that I washed it off before time.  My face was red and stayed red for a day or so. It didn't cleanse or hydrate like out said it would. Just burns! I sent it back.,0
I would recommend this product as with all OPI products it's easy to use and provides good coverage. It is a little hard to remove but not much so.  I would order it again.,1
Smaller than it looks in photo,0
"The stuff is beyond exceptional.  On a scale of 1 to 5 it's a solid 10.  My oversensitive doesn't like anything skin has no adverse reactions.  I love it, love it, love it.",1
"this is a watered down item, would not buy again!  I can use a half a bottle and you cant smell it 2 minutes later....dont buy",0
"It is great for lengthy moisture to little ones skin. Babies do not keep moisture like adults. Down side it stinks but dries quickly and smell is short lived, contrary to some reviews. Great for extra TLC for out little ones skin. Pricey but I believe it's been worth it!",1
Excellent and super fast thank you,1
"Even though it is sold by ""Azzaro"", but it doesn't smell like the sample I got from a department store! I loved it and based on the sample I decided to buy it. Now I regret buying it online because it smells a little different and doesn't last as much.",0
happy with this product,1
I am still breaking out. I keep using until I run out. Not sure why I even purchased this. Thumbs down PCA,0
The only thing that made this box worth purchasing is that you get the $19 credit  back to your account to be used to purchase something tagged in Amazons luxury beauty section. So in essence the box is free or if purchased you get a $19 gift of your choice. Compared to other better known beauty boxes out there this would be at the lower end in comparison to the products that you get..,0
"I recently had the opportunity to try out the PMD and I have to say that it left my face feeling super smooth! There is a bit of a learning curve so I definitely recommend reading the full pamphlet and watching the video (as well as using the training disc) the first few times. I haven't upgraded to a different disc yet since I've only had it two weeks and treatments are supposed to be a week apart. Even with the training disc, my skin felt super smooth. I'm looking forward to getting more confident using it and even trying it out on my husband!",1
Nice size for traveling.  Heats quickly.,1
"If you are like me, and take most of your showers at the gym, these types of bags are a necessity.  They don't need to be flashy or looks cool, just work.

This bag does do the job of carrying body wash, and face wash or after shave.  The big problem I have with this bag is the outside pocket.  It is small and does not fasten shut.  The outside pocket is what I use to carry razors, toothbrush, etc.  With this bag, they are prone to falling out on the locker room floor.  Not a place I want my toothbrush!

For the higher price of this bag, I believe the outside pocket should have a zipper as well.  .",0
"fresh and seductive fragrance for any girl who is fashionable and does not lose its conservative side, a good choice",1
Sensitive skin this is the one for you.  Easy to use and holds the charge forever.  Love it.,1
I saw this product advertised GMA and I was so excited to try it. All I got was more oily hair plus a white residue that made it look worse. I have dark hair so I tried it on my daughters light hair but I got the same results. I couldn't see any white residue but it her hair still looked oily.,0
Love this mascara! It defines all of my blonde lashes and doesn't dry them out like other products. I use this mascara along with GrandeLASH MD. Can't go wrong with that combination.,1
Not so long lasting,0
Awesome,1
"This is a nice set for both men and women. The finished nail color is crisp and clean; nails look natural and healthy. The satin topcoat is not glossy but rather produces a matte, natural finsh. I love the look, but the only issue I have is that it chips within 3-4 days.",1
Received faster than I can blink an eye.. Very lightly scented and no greasy feel.. doesn't give as much shine as I hoped but it will do for now,1
"OPI is always my first choice when I buy nail polish, base and top coat,  Decided to try their polish remover. Worked the same as my less expenive Cutex remover.  Like OPI bottle shape better.",1
"I have very thin, fine hair and even though I keep it cut short I still need help with extra body.  I've tried so many other products that just don't work well, or they make my hair feel dirty the first time I use the product.  This product doesn't do that and it adds the extra body and texture that makes styling my hair much easier.  It doesn't take much of the product to do a good job so a bottle lasts a long time.  This is my second bottle and I'm sure I'll continue to order it as needed.  I would recommend this to a friend.",1
I used this product for a month and saw no change in my face.  My wrinkles did not decrease at all.,0
"I thought this product had a strange smell, not was different from the Mustela lotion. Also, the spray top didn't spray well, more like a dribble. I wouldn't re-purchase.",0
This product has a very strong smell.  It smells like old lady perfume.  I've never known any La Roche-Posay product to have such a strong scent.  I'm sorry I bought this online instead of trying it in person.,0
"The smell is pretty good, but weak.  It goes away within 15 minutes",0
Used it while hiking through the rain forest in Ecuador and it kept me chaff free. I'll give it two thumbs up as I still use it daily and it doesnt create a huge mess like powder would.,1
do not like the smell or texture.. If I  could return I would.,0
Horrible. Made my hair look dirtier. Maybe not good for fine hair which is what I have.,0
It did what was described,1
"Not included in the product description on Amazon, a small label affixed to the product... ""Warning: This product contains a chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer.""",0
"Does not work as well as my MUCH less expensive flat iron. The bump in the design is ineffective and unnecessary. I would have done better if I had just bought a regular FLAT iron. Not impressed at all, especially for the price I paid. I wanted to return it but I am four days past the return date...UGH!!!",0
"I LOVE every piece that came in this bag AND the bag itself!! I had never used any other Lorac item other than the POREfection Baked Perfecting Powder and just wanted to try it out. Truly couldn't be more satisfied.
The eye shadow colors are perfect, bright, easy to shade and stay on throughout the day.
Mascara doesn't do that flakey thing some of the non-waterproof ones do.
Blush is just bright enough to be seen but not overly bold
Finally, the lip gloss is a little shiny for me but just a blotch and it's perfect!!!!",1
it does not heat any more and i have only had it for 8 mons,0
It take ALOT of product to even look like you have it on and then it smears all over your eyes all day.  I will not buy again.,0
Loved this for over 25 years.,1
I normally buy this at a store and I LOVE this product.  The one from this vender on amazon made me break out in a rash!!!,0
"Exactly what I was looking for, the discounted price was a HUGE bonus.  Only wish the scent stayed with me a bit longer throughout the day.  Oh well, will just have to refresh!",1
"good sturdy, pretty material, slender, holds a lot of stuff, i use it to hold my whole-sale mineral makeup products, instead of hair stuff.",1
"The product I received is a fake, I've been using silk infusion for years and this is not it, while usually pale yellow in color, this is clear and is making the ends of my hair dry and brittle. Buyer beware.",0
I love this Shampoo and Conditioner! It keeps my hair super soft and it doesn't take much of either product for my long thick hair to lather. My hair was damaged so bad the last time I got it highlighted. My hair literally fried... as in started steaming!! It is so badly damaged from the treatment and using this product has worked wonders to get it back to new again. I would highly recommend. It has kept my blondes the same color since I got it dyed.,1
Son's acne became smaller,1
"I bought this product due to the great reviews... my hair is elbow length, so I use it mainly on my ends and around my face to add a little volume and bounce.

Initially I loved it, until I turned my head while sitting at my desk one day at work and a curl landed right near my nose... MY HAIR SMELLED TERRIBLE!!!

This curling iron gives my hair the WORST smelling ""burned hair"" scent that I have ever, EVER experienced.

I use an all-over styling cream on my hair when it is damp, I use a thermal heat protector on the ends, I don't curl my hair until it is completely dry, and I keep the heat at a moderate-low temperature... I've tried everything, yet the smell cannot be prevented.

I finally found a solution. I have stopped using the curling iron and learned (by watching eHow/youtube videos) how to curl my hair using my Smart CHI volumizing flat iron.

Now my hair is finally back to normal and I don't smell that awful scent anymore.

Gross.",0
"It heats up well, but it grabs and tangles my hair on the ends to the point that I've burnt my hair from taking so long to get my hair out of the iron.",0
This was way too much money to pay for something that doesnt work like its suppose to. It didn't help my hair at all. and I slept in t twice.,0
Great stuff. Doesn't bother my sensitive skin.,1
The on/off button is right on the handle and easily turns off while you're using it---not a great user design. Would not recommend this straightener.,0
It's nice but be prepared for your hair to be a bit dry from use.  It's great for a very straight hair style.,1
The effect of this foundation is very cakey.  I have older skin with lines and this foundation emphasizes them.  It does a good job of covering  age spots but  the trade off is not good.,0
Good coverage but wipes of easily. Waiting for the setting powders in original & saffron to see if it still gets on my hands and clothes.,1
"Years ago, I remember my Dad bringing some home and I tried it.  From what I remember, it was a slight sting but it really smelled nice.  I like it but I'd like to see it drop down in price a little more... Either way, I wish it would be a permanent scent in their collection because it needs to be available.  There's not much of this out there.",1
"Works as marketed, but nothing special.  I have used over the counter products that work just as well if not better.",0
"FAKE PRODUCT DO NOT BUY! After my product came thinking I wouldn't get a fake product, I did. Currently in the process of returning it back.",0
Got to order sum more work good on daughter face.,1
Love this shampoo.  My hair is fine and I color it every six weeks.  This product makes my hair shiny and gives it body.,1
"This prep spray smells so good! It protects my hair from damage when I dry, straighten or curl it. Very happy with it!",1
Not the same as when I use to buy it sticky and made my hair hard.,0
Great product! Made my natural blonde hair shiny and soft. Took a few uses but turned out wonderfully. Go to ulta though. It's $13.50 there.,1
I have very sensitive skin and this works great.  I use it at night and during the day under sun protection.,1
at one time! I've tried everything. I end up wasting SO much. Nothing wrong with the actually concealer. I really like Stila products but they really need to work on their containers!,0
"Great iron and a great price...a total hit, no question!",1
"The color does not like the picture shows
Want to return it but amazon rufused",0
"The smell is oily, but it goes away once the hair dries.  It may be unpleasant to some, but I don't think it's all that bad.  It works though.",1
What the hell mine isn't turning on i can't believe it's not turning on,0
Over priiced but good. Can find it at most hair salons which give a discount. Still a great product,1
"This product is great for the fiber fill in for hair, I would recommend this to all people wanting something to hold your hair in place. RDG",1
Exactly what I expected,1
Items broken in box.,0
Great so far but the buttons are a little old school.  I expected something a little more high tech but the overall quality is great and it dries very well.,1
"I have no complaint with the company I purchased from. They sent everything in a nice, well cushioned package, and on time. Thank you for that. My complaint is the product. As a hopeful customer, I read the reviews that seemed to sanctify this product, and make it seem worthy of it's price. Wake up call, I received it, and on the first day noticed the weird scent. It's not good at all, it smells leafy. the lavender itself did not smell like lavender. That was my first initial reaction, the second was after I used the product. It absolutely did nothing to my hair. I came out of the shower feeling slimy. The money I paid for this, and a double set of it's lotion came to a grand total of $35. What a waste. I went to the store and bought Pantene for $4. My hair came out feeling much better on the first wash, after I stopped using the tea tree lavender concoction. Think twice before you spend your money on this product. Everyone has different hair types and shampoos that work for them.",0
"I've been using this product for years, and it's money well spent. One of the best exfoliants I've come across.",1
Very hydrating and not greasy,1
"hard to apply, the black pencil fell out as soon as I used a sharpener... was disapointed",0
very quiet as touted. Functions very well otherwise too. I like it.,1
"After reading other reviews, I thought this shampoo would eventually give me some scalp relief. Unfortunately, there was zero relief after using this bottle of shampoo as directed. Wish it had worked. I can't answer to the quality of the shampoo, I can only say it was ineffective for me.",0
"The product has two ends, the liquid end dries up fast and the other end is self sharpening. Well, it doesn't self sharpen. Good wear when you can get it on nicely.",0
"I have been using this product for quite a while, very satisfied. It's too bad it can't make me beautiful, just my skin :)",1
This product seems more watery than the last one I had.,0
"I was never a fan of the aerosol versions of dry shampoo, they always left build up and never really did what I had hoped. I took a chance and tried this stuff and was amazed. I have light blonde hair, so the light color powder works great. I do have friends with dark hair and have also found it works wonders. I did learn that it works best when applied before bed, so the powder has a chance to do it's job. Add the powder around the hair line or wherever your hair needs it most, then brush it through your hair a few times, go to bed and wake up with beautiful hair that is full of body. The lemon scent is very light and fresh and the powder consistency of this stuff is great for travel. No worries with having it in your carry on bag and you really don't need to use a lot to get a good effect, so it lasts quite a while. A great bargain. Try it, you'll see!",1
I can't say enough about this soap.,1
Amazing product,1
It is good at diminishing age spots but not as good as the old formula. I noticed the new stuff is much lighter in color. But it does help which is more than most of the other ones do.,1
"So much easier than the cream.
Much more slicker than cream as well.
Smooth shave, leaving your skin feels refreshing.
Awesome product. I can't imagine using any other.",1
Very good product.,1
Did nothing for me at all. Used it for 8 months. Not worth the $$. Better stuff on the market.,0
So far I am enjoying this product. It has been approx 2 months and I'm seeing some spots w less hair. It is not painful and easy to use. Will keep using this product. Way better than no! No! Way way way better.,1
this product did absolutely nothing.  I get better and faster results with crest white strips.  The activator vials are ridiculous.  The give you a q tip to spread the product on the teeth but when you inset it into the vial...all the gel squirts out all over  the place...no matter how slowly you do it.  A waste of money.  Sorry I had to give it one star..wish there could be a no star rating,0
Way overpriced.  I lasted only about 3 weeks with once a day use.  I would recommend going to Trader Joe's and getting a nice bar of milled soap for about $3.30$,0
"have used for several years, but my last one had a nozzle problem and I had to discard it after barely used. going back to a hand pump style hairspray now.",0
"Arrived on time. Great condition. Lovely fragrance, just a little expensive I think. I thinks is appropriate for day use, especially for afternoon. I  use it for work, and i think is Ok.",1
The lotion says its oil free and possibly so. I know it makes my face feel as though I'm wearing glue. It stops up the pores of my skin and causes an outbreak and I'm 62........,0
"These are great.  I have relaxed african american hair. I used these after air drying and blow drying and was able to achieve a perfect roller set and duby.  The rollers are fast, the clips work better than the metal stick pins, and the curls are awesome.  The only hair products used were a light oil and organics olive oil cream moisturizer.  I am looking forward to adding these to my gym after-swim rotation.",1
It is a free sample that is being illlegaly sold on amazon. The tube had barely a drop of the product. This item should be banned.,0
"I am enjoying this set of four shades (I have the Rose palette)- the colors look vibrant and rich, and the shades are well-chosen to complement each other-- from brightening to smoldering (plum-mish hue on the darkest shade) so this compact can easily take you from day to night. You do need your own applicator, however.

There is a good amount of product in a beautiful mirrored pack, with each circle of color being a bit larger than a quarter in diameter. This is good, since I found i needed to add a few applications for concentrated color. However, I don't use a primer, and that would no doubt help. The color does stay all day, and feels creamy and smooth and sticks to my normal moisturizer--there's no powdery fly-away on application, or any creasing later.  I'm a make-up loving gal, and this Bliss eyeshadow palette is a great addition to my makeup collection.",1
"I really wanted to believe other reviewers when seeing it helped with their breakouts since I have oily, highly acne-prone skin. However, this product became extremely drying, with no effective moisturizer to help compensate. I would recommend this more as a careful spot treatment on only large pimples, and not as a means to cover a larger area of skin if you are sensitive.",0
Love this product. Way better price than you would find at the spa. Happy with this item,1
"Bought for my SO. Shaving cream is nice, the pre oil is nice, the after balm might be a little too much for sensitive skin. However, the brush, is absolute garbage. I don't know how much of this $50/$60 price is going towards the brush, but I'd imagine it's supposed to be a good amount. First off, it has the most awful chemical smell, that despite being left to soak, washed, whatever, DOES NOT GO AWAY. Second off, the bristles started coming out on my SO's face the first use!! Still seeing them come out after several uses, not like it's ""breaking in."" Don't waste your money on this kit just go to a store and buy some cheaper shaving cream and oils. While the products are nice, they're not worth this price tag.",0
"This little gem works as well as the larger, non-travel version.  I love that it is pink and white so that you can see your lashes to make sure you're curling all of them.  I had a black travel one but couldn't see my lashes.  Don't squeeze too hard because you could snap off the thumb handle.  It's a great tool to have in my travel makeup bag.",1
"The seller of this product did not send me what was advertised.  I purchased the ""regular"" StriVectin (as in the picture) that has the slight minty aroma.  What I was sent was the version for sensitive skin, which has a horrible smell, and instead of the bright pink square as in the picture, it is white with a pink border.

This seller duped me.",0
I have used this for years. It is amazing.,1
"Do not buy - Smells like cotton candy for 3 seconds and then becomes putrid. You think you are saving money but you are really losing in the long run. Again - do not buy!

**UPDATE** Apparently, the company that produces this fragrance has decided to remove their logo from the bottles and the outer case [....] The new bottle I ordered from Sephora's website looked exactly the same as the knock off from Amazon. The real one smells 100X's better. I've learned that somethings are too good to be true. If you're going to pamper yourself - or someone else- do it the right way and splurge by purchasing from a company that sells the real thing. (This same size cost $22 on Sephora's website)",0
"I tried this product as soon as I got it and it looks good when I look it on the mirror, also feels like I have more hair instantly. Actually I found this product  when searching for a similar product. I had never heard of it before, so thought of trying it once but now I feel like buying more. I've never spent money on hair building products to cover my bald spots or thinning hair, so I wasn't expecting much from this product.",1
"I've been using Supersmile for several years and love it!!  I have very sensitive teeth with receding gums, but Supersmile toothpaste and the whitening pre-rinse do NOT hurt my teeth.  I do, however, use a toothpaste for sensitive teeth for one week before going to the dentist so I'm more comfortable.  My dentist always tells me, ""Whatever you're using, keep on using it because your teeth look great.""  My teeth are super white because of the Supersmile toothpaste and pre-rinse and I have never had a dentist whiten them, nor have I ever used whitening strips or anything like that.",1
It makes it easier to apply the fibers. Got have  it.,1
Smells great and softens hair.  Way over priced though!,1
"Good product. If used consistently, it will reduce breakouts on your back. The smell is rather unpleasant..smells very alcohol-y. The reason I am giving this product 1 star is that the price doubled. It used to be $20 for the large bottle, now it's $40. This is completely unjustified, especially since the ingredients have not changed in the slightest.",0
Probably the best of the many shave soaps/creams. Love the size for travel and home use - requires very little cream to make a great lather. No follow up lotion needed either - seems pricey but its not in the long run.,1
"I ordered the 2.5% serum and ended up receiving the 5%...this was misleading and ended up not working for me. It's not worth returning, though.",0
Excellent product for face screen. Absolutely non greasy. The best I have ever used! Highly recommend it over any other product in the market.,1
like the product,1
"I do agree with other reviewers that this cream CAN look chalky. If you don't glop it on like traditional sunscreens, though, you'll find that it completely disappears. You'll also be saving $$ because you aren't using it up as quickly. I like it a lot because it leaves no indication of having ever been applied: no greasy feel and no shine. Just remember: apply as much as needed but as little as possible and you'll love this product.",1
I've been using this on my dcollet for about three months. I have been liberal with it and using it once a day. My husband began commenting on how much better it looked after one month. It has made a huge difference! My skin now looks like there is no sun damage and it is much smoother! I'm about to purchase my second tube. I have now begun to use it on my face and am looking forward to the am same results. I am 41 and have very fair skin and spent much of my youth in the sun.,1
Love it does exactly what I need it to do.,1
Neither the curling results or iron itself are long lasting.  The biggest annoyance was that it died on me after less than a year of using it once per week.  I have had straightening and curling irons that have lasted 5 yrs + on average.,0
This is a very harsh toner. My skin pealed badly and felt like it burnt my skin. Doesn't smell like grapefruit and the liquid is weirdly frothy. I hate the green color of the liquid as it feels like I'm applying chemicals on my face and the smell doesnt help. DISLIKE.,0
After a month I saw no change at all in my skin tone.,0
Sticky. I would not recommend,0
"I have been purchasing this product for a long time and I loved it.  It came in a little container with a screw top and I used my own brush on it.  When I got this ""new packaging"" concept, I didn't even know how to use it.  There are no instructions.  Okay, when I figured it out, then it ""showered"" the yellow powder all over my nightgown top.  And that is wasteful.  The old container allowed me to put some on my brush and tap out the excess so I didn't waste of it.  It is not an inexpensive powder.  So now I get this little wasteful tube and it costs the same amount as it did previously.  It doesn't look as if it is the same amount of powder as the original.  What's up with this?  Whose great idea was it to put it in the new container.  I hate it!",0
Doesn't work.,0
"Overpriced. Shadows are not good quality.  Shadows mix in with gloss. For the price,  I expected better packaging. The inly good thing is: You are getting a lot of product.",0
Original formula is the best.,0
"This worked very well for around a year or so, then it started running VERY hot. I didn't think much of it and just turned it down to medium. Fast forward a few months, my hair is completely dried out and constantly breaking from the heat of this drier. Don't waste your money and be hesitant in believing all of the amazing reviews.",0
I had used the Eucalyptus version of Proraso and figured I would give the Sandalwood a try. I really like the fragrance and go between the two Proraso shaving creams depending on how I feel. This is my second purchase of the sandalwood and it won't be my last!,1
"It is pretty good. I agree with most of the users am very picky when it comes to shaving products. I might stick with this and alternate with the menthol for a great number of years. Furthermore, might never go back to shaving soap",1
"The smell is great. But, this was supposed to be a free add-on item. It was not free. :(",0
I like a spray that holds but doesn't make my hair stiff.  CHI Enviro 54 natural hold is awesome.  I've used this product over 2 years now and even though I don't like paying the price - tight wad here - I can't find any brand that I like better.  So I'm sticking with this one.,1
"Good stuff -- always use this in the sun, and sometimes randomly as well, and it is the only chapstick with SPF that doesn't taste horrible.",1
My daughter uses this and with the mitt it goes on nicely,1
"This FHI hairdryer medium and high power quit working after about 7 months.  Loved this lightweight, professional quality hair dryer until then (purchased June 11th from Amazon LLC)..  Expected it last for a few more years at $132.  Amazon return policy is only 30 days.  Will look for a replacement somewhere else. Be wary.",0
Great product!!,1
Wrong color inside box.,0
"I really like this dry shampoo. The smell is amazing and I use it whenever my hair gets a bit oily. Don't over apply it though, otherwise the top of your head will come off as white and powdery looking, especially at the roots",1
"This product does not seem to work and comes in a TINY bottle, the size of a sample size. Not at all worth the time or money. I had high hopes for this product, and I am very disappointed with the results",0
"The first time I tried Moroccanoil I liked it. As the day went on I realized that though the product does shine my hair up nicely, it was the smell I was hooked on. It's like a blend of suntan lotion, white amber and musk. It perfumes your hair in a subtle 'Arabian Nights' kind of way that I haven't found in any other shine product. I find it works much better if I rub a quarter sized dollop into my hair after a wash and condition it while it's damp. I can see the shine on dry hair if I have a pulled back 'do, but if my curly hair is just running wild, I need a whole lot of it to see a difference. At these prices, I'd rather not use a whole lot of it - LOL. I'm hoping to find a similar scented essential oil that I can just mix with a cheaper hair serum so I can have my scent fix without breaking the bank. All in all I like it  go to a hair supply store and smell it first to see if it's your cup o tea.",1
Good product to use with your Nuface,1
I was.dissappointed at.product.  It streaked while applying. The color is the only thing I liked about Polish. I have had better results from.less expensive polish,0
it is broken and  so dirty in shipping box. and make my other product dirty,0
The new handle is very hard to work with and I keep burning my thumbs - very unstable - like the old handles.,0
Love the rollerball but the scent was more like smelling the clean skin of an old granny...,0
"I am not usually a skin cream person.  But I must say, I love the way my skin feels after applying this lotion.  It leaves my skin soft and smooth, not at all greasy.  I use this wonderful lotion every day.  It has a subtle, fine scent.",1
"This quick fix stick offers satisfactory coverage where I need it. It obliterates red, puffy scars and matches up to tan lines.",1
"This is garbage. The problem isn't the hairspray- it's the nozzle. It quits working half way through the can. I've bought this here on Amazon, Ulta and hair salons. No matter where I buy it the nozzle ends up breaking or just quits working. I've tried running hot water on the nozzle and it doesn't work. One time the spray nozzle went rouge and just wouldn't stop spraying. It's not operator error- it's made poorly. There is certainly a problem with the company and quality control. I'm just using another brand now. I even emailed the Rusk company and didn't get a response. I've probably thrown out 4 half full cans in the past year. Don't waste your money. I'm over it.",0
"It's halfway full and quit working.  Obviously, they have a problem with this because you can read the same issue in the other reviews.
Don't waste you money on it.
We use Bedhead now.",0
The best smelling baby wash!,1
"OMG! I had a horrible reaction to this cream!!!!!
My friend gave me some to try and my skin grew hot, bright.re, swollen all over and hives all the way down my chest!!!!!",0
"I love Blinc mascara and have used it for 4 or 5 years.  It doesn't run and washes off with warm water and a wash cloth.
I use the primer with it to set the 'tubes' on each eyelash better.",1
My husband loves this product!!,1
"These are extremely easy to use. the color looks perfect, and dries really fast.",1
I have baby fine hair so product build up is a concern. This mist goes on clean and does a great job detangling. Also adds shine,1
I used this before when I bought it 5 years ago. Now that i ran out I reordered. I get a lot of complements on my legs when I put this on. I love it and so do my friends. Totally recommend it for getting shiny and tanned legs.,1
This does not have the fragrance of the original C & E Nantucket Briar!  It has very little smell at all!,0
"It's always preferable when trying a new scent to wait approximately 1/2 hour to see how your body reacts.  While I'm certain that this Juicy Couture Eau de Parfum Spray will be fine on some individuals, I found it to be too cloying and sweet for my taste.  I much prefer my signature Mitsouko by Guerlain or the very difficult to find, Kingdom by Alexander McQueen.",0
"First of all the dispenser doesn't work so I unscrew the cap every time I use it. I have followed instructions, but haven't seen any changes.  It is drying so use your moisture lotion.",0
"The smell is quite unpleasant; for the price, you don't get very much of it; and it scarcely removes any trace of makeup--and I use a light application of mineral makeup, not anything heavy. I have to wash my face again with something else to remove the remainder. I won't repurchase.",0
"I was disappointed with the coverage. I understand that it is pale, but it applied very unevenly. Disappointing. It also chipped the next day.",0
"Did NOT perform as advertised!!  Promised to remain chip-free for about 2 weeks but chipped in 2 days...and I have a very easy desk job!!  I followed instructions of reapplying every 3rd day but by 3rd application, nails turned milky white (not very attractive look). Would NOT buy this brand again.",0
Good stuff!,1
"I really like this base coat, it looks especially nice over a pink or purple toned nail polish! Thank you!",1
Packaging looks better than it really is. Smells like really strong dish soap or bad car freshener. Doesn't make your skin feel extra moisturized after either.,0
"Might be the worst dry shampoo I've ever used. Smells harsh, expensive and makes my hair somehow look dirtier than before I used it. 0/10 would not recommend.",0
It was probably my fault but was TOTALLY Surprised and disappointed when I realized my order.  Not because the product (perfume) was wrong but it was a mini size that I had paid the same price for previously for a MUCH bigger bottle.,0
Love the scent.,1
"I love the product but the packaging is terrible. Thus product gives me beautiful curls without making my hair stiff and crunchy. If you are a curl product user you know how great that is.
I would have given the product a 5 star rating but the pump doesn't work. I even bought a second bottle thinking maybe I just got a bad pump in the first one. Not! The pump isn't strong enough or the tube is too thin and it can't pull the product up to dispense it. I have to pull the pump out and pound (like for ketchup) to get product into my hand. I think an inverted squeeze bottle would be better for this product.",1
"The iron worked well, when it worked. At first it was fine but after only three months it seemed to get a short in it. No matter where I plugged it in sometimes it would heat up and sometimes it wouldn't. I ended up buying something else. Not a brand I would buy again.",0
Love this curling iron. Makes beautiful waves that last!,1
"Cajun shrimp is my favorite nail polish color!  Bright and the prefect coral red.  Seems to look great on everyone!  I have about 50 nail polishes and this is probably my favorite!  Great quality, no streaking, and seems to last.",1
"works really well for me, but maybe not for everyone;  I love the texture and look of this product, but you really have to use a tiny amount! Just a dot here and there, it blends easily on skin prepared with a good serum and/or primer.  I put a light dusting of Jane Iredale foundation over it and it's a lovely look---light and natural. There is a definite white cast to this because of the sunblock, so I don't know if it would work well for darker skin tones.",1
tiny.,0
"I just used this razor for the first time, and it has given me the best shave I have ever had. I have used other brands of double edge razors, all of which worked well, but this razor surpasses them all. I'll never shave with anything else. I am glad I purchased it.",1
"I am doubtful that this is authentic or new.  Ive purchased this oil in person in a salon before.  This smells and feels like straight sunflower oil.  The packaging seemed new and authentic.  Id like to request refund, especially after waiting several weeks and having the price get jacked up after initial order.",0
"This definitely wasn't worth the $19.99, even though you get a $19.99 credit on your account (which I have yet to receive) apparently you have select items that you can use the credit on & the list I'm seeing, I don't want any of it. The samples I got, half I won't use & the other half is in another language so I have to look up how to use them or what they even are. One of the items was toothpaste. Really? Luxury toothpaste? That's ridiculous. There wasn't one thing that I was excited about or even intrigued by. Basically wasted my money.",0
"I bought this based on its cult following but I have to say I'm not a fan. It goes on greasy, takes a long time to absorb, and smells like mothballs. Yes, the smell dissipates, but why bother when there are so many other pleasant smelling and/or fragrance-free options? The color and texture are similar to nasal mucus. It's just a big fat no all-around. I'll stick with Aquaphor.",0
Perfect,1
"It's cheaper than Neiman's and I haven't tried it yet, but I'm assuming
it's exactly as effective or you will be hearing back from me!",1
Great product,1
"This is the best shower gel I've used and I'd highly recommend it to anyone. The price, however, is steep. But you DO get what you pay for!",1
This is a light moisturizer that does not leave your skin feeling greasy. ork grea for me. I use SkinMedica cleanser and toner and they w,1
Too strong smell & no shine,0
works great,1
This product fried my hair and made it feel stiff and crispy.  It felt like extra hold hairspray and did not make my hair soft or shiny... very disappointing!,0
Did not work. Try another product. No need to waste money. Used the whole bottle as directed as saw no different result.,0
It's okay to cover a small patch...once in a while.,1
Can not tell yet,0
"Great curling iron. I have really long hair, so it's sometimes difficult to style. This curling iron is the perfect size for large, flowing curls.",1
no comment,1
"I bought this product before and it doesn't smell or last like the original. I will never buy it again from the same place, but will pay more to get it from Khols",0
Is this not the real thing?The smell goes away fast. Not very happy with it.,0
This product does not work for thin hair - the surface is very slick and my hair slips through it.  I am unable to use the product and missed the return date.,0
smelled terrible and to liquefied.,0
Product came and the spray nozzle wasn't working.,0
I think it was old!,0
I saw this product given the thumbs up in a magazine-- decided to try it. Glad I did -- love this eye cream!!!,1
"This stuff is awful.  The product itself is pretty good - it is a finely milled powder that does seem to work very well.  The major problem is the application!  I thought I was getting a spray - but no!  This has a hole at the top of the bottle and you squeeze and powder comes out more or less depending on how you tip the bottle.  It is not a spray at all.  I found this out when I jumped in my car with it (in a hurry, no time to wash my hair - get it?)  I tried spraying this on my roots and either got nothing or huge chunks of powder in my hair.  I tried squeezing it in my fingers to try to distribute it myself through my roots and powder just got everywhere.  I'm pretty sure if a cop had stopped me, my car would've looked like a big Coke-fest had happened in my car - fine white powder everywhere.  A mess.  I use this in my bathroom now, but after this container is gone, I'm not repurchasing.  I'm going back to using Johnson's baby powder in a sample size - at least it has multiple small holes, rather than one larger one, for the powder to come out in.",0
Was so excited to retry this item used 30 years ago. Seemed very weak. No hold at all and smelled weak too.,0
This is not new. The box was opened and the product had hair inside of it. The accessories also had little hairs all over it. I'm grossed out. I thought I was purchasing a new one,0
Over priced and does not last any longer then any other nail polish.,0
"I'm only giving this one star because the product container is defective. Upon using the first time, as I squeezed out the conditioner, the entire bottle cracked open. I'm very surprised a company as large as this would make such defective bottles. It is make of hard plastic, so when you squeeze it, it bursts open!! Now I have to figure out how to get it into some other container without loosing half of a $10 conditioner. Very disappointed in this situation.",0
Stinks like fresh dirt and wet clay. Yuck!,0
"This shaving soap has grown on me since I ran out of the Omega and started using it more. I find the scent pleasing and the shave satisfying. Definitely a great shave, worth the 10 bucks.

For those who don't know this soap has a new formula as of 2012 that removed some of the more questionable chemicals in the ingredients. I'm not sure of the other changes made, as I never used the old formula, being relatively new to shaving soap in tubs.

The same was done to Omega, except I don't believe Proraso mades Omega any longer. I used to like the Omega's scent but the more I used this stuff the more I found the Omega's scent too strong. They both shaved very similarly. The new version of the Omega I did not like and threw out.  I kept this stuff.

After trying a few other brands, I must say that this soap is a good bang for the buck at 10 bucks or less. Pleasing scent. Good Shave.  I still prefer the following brand over Proraso though:

Taylor of old Bond Street's various shave creams. I can get a shave with less cuts while being more aggressive and fast with the shave.  I've tested this many times. Because it's a cream it's applied in very small amounts to the badger brush compared to a more vigorous circular swirling of the brush with the soaps like Proraso. There are numerous scents to choose from. I suppose a fair comparison though would be Proraso's Shaving Cream in the Tube with this brand, but I already have enough shave cream/soap to last a couple years here. :)

For traveling when I want to toss the shave soap into a hot car, or when I want about the strongest menthol cooling effect I've come across in shaving soaps, glycerin based soaps like Mama Bears/Awakenings Mentholated shaving soap are what I toss into the suitcase, as it does not melt and turn into a mess in a hot car.. stays nice and solid, ready for use. :)  It's shave it comparable to Proraso, slightly thinner maybe, very strong cooling effect if you order the Mentholated one.

I see no reason to try any other brands outside these three. Pick what works best for you and go from there. Life's too short to not enjoy your shave to it's fullest.",1
"My favorite perfume,  I loved!",1
It does the job well. I would like it better if it had a nice smell to it. It is kind of bland.,1
"Combining apples, bergamot, warm jasmine,, sandalwood, and moss has made Burberry's Eau De Parfum a compelling product women can embrace. Musky yet soft and easy to smell, the perfume can captivate the hearts and minds of people around.",1
"Looks like I need to replace this curling iron. I pulled it out of a drawer and my hand stuck to the plastic handle. I've been trying to remove the sticky gunk with every adhesive remover known to man. Last ditch effort was to use paint thinner, but it removed the gold lettering also. It's still a mystery what this sticky gunk is and how it got there, but I suspect either a) the plastic got too hot or b) a mist of hairspray fell on it and turned into glue. It's truly one of the oddest things I've ever seen and I've been using curling irons for 40+ years.",0
"Sadly, I believe I got a bad tube. Either that, or this is just not a good product. The product dries yellow/orange on my skin, which gives me a jaundiced pallor. Not quite the look I'm going for. The expiration date on the tube shows 06/20, so it is not an expired lot. The Lot # shows 54P700. Anyone else have this product with this Lot # and experiencing the same issue?",0
I have struggled with acne prone skin since puberty. I have followed many dermatologist recommendations for  foundation. Absolutely none compare to this product. I still apply a primer before I apply to help battle breakouts but since using the dermafinish I break out less often/severely. Just as important GREAT coverage and long lasting!,1

This is not real the smell is not as the original I know I get for what I pay but lesson learn,0
Greats short lasting  light clean scent when used alone but really needs to be used in conjunction with Elizabeth Arden body wash and lotion to have the full staying power that last all day,1
The stuff is great,1
Excellent product . I love ir! Ir really makes a difference,1
"I don't know if it's my machine or the adapters, but it's not suctioning. Sorry for this negative review",0
"Tried other natural tinted moisturizers and CC creams. Most end up being too peachy/orangey for my fair skin, even though I'm using the ""fair to light"" color. This Ivory color is the first to truly match my pale, freckle-prone, ""Irish-inspired"" skin. It seems to last all day, though I haven't tried it on a particularly sweaty, outdoorsy outing yet. It's creamy and easy to apply. The ""whiteness"" of the cream - probably due to the zinc-based sunscreen - disappears when you rub it in. Doesn't settle into my 37-year-old fine lines.

Only 2 cons, and hence minus half a star each, smells a little like a fresh vegetable patch or maybe a veggie-heavy smoothie. I don't mind it, but it isn't ""wonderful,"" and I can see how it would be off-putting if you're looking for/used to flowery or fruity. And while it does even out skin tone a little and provide some pore coverage, it really doesn't make a big difference visually. I may as well not be wearing anything. I was hoping for a little more coverage, but maybe that's my fault since it's a ""tinted moisturizer"" and not a cc cream. I have pretty good skin and don't want spackle, but would like more coverage for the price. Not sure if I will order again.",1
"This worked well and blended nicely, but it was a little difficult to apply. It's easy to get it on your scalp, so it takes a while to become good at application.",1
"it is a very strong floral scent, too strong. not spicy scent at all. it's like old 60's perfume scent my grandma had on.  It gave me a headache the moment I sprayed.  it lingers for a very long time.  It is definitely a whole day perfume strength.",0
"Less gross than 'Royal' flavor- but still Marvis, so it's gross.
Just minty with a little ginger flavor. If you want a ginger flavored toothpaste... lmk if you find one 'cause this isn't it.",0
nice,1
"This is great stuff for short or thin hair...not so much on long, thick, heavy hair. But my daughter loves this stuff and stole it from me immediately.",1
"Good coverage, but hard to get off clothes.",0
"I absolutely love this stuff and a little goes a long way. I found out about CHI silk infusion in the most unusual way.  I was at a parade for Mardi Gras and one of the floats that had a bunch of hair stylists on it were throwing small sample bottles of these along with shampoo.  After trying this I was hooked.  After getting out of the shower I put a small amount in my hand, rub my hands together and run it through my hair.  My hair is long and even with condition I have a hard time combing it out when wet.  After running this through my hair it combs out easily and helps to put a shine in it.  I also use in on my daughters hair which is completely different than mine.  She is biracial and has very curly hair that gets dry easily.  This stuff is great for her hair the same as mine.  This stuff isn't cheap and this is the best price I have found it anywhere.",1
good product,1
This stuff is a rip off!  Does not work as shown on TV commercial!  I would not recommend this to anyone!  What a mess!,0
very happy,1
The product as shown in the picture was not what I received in the mail. I received a HUGO deodorant but a completely different model that was different than the one I was looking for. I should have received what I ordered.,0
fantastic liner. does not run!,1
Works keeping hair on my head,1
I have thick and coarse hair. But this doesn't do me the favor as it has promised. Disappointing!,0
Its great- a little thick and hard to get out of tube but last all night when placed at bed time!,1
Feels nice no complaints but I can't say that I have noticed a difference on dark circles or anything.,1
The original lotion and shampoo I bought before from this brand smelled amazing but it is unfortunately and disappointingly not the same fragrance I thought I was buying,0
This product leaves my hair somewhat soft but i can get it softer with an item from my local supercenter for a way more affordable price. The smell is okay. I was starting to wonder if i got the real product.,0
Best hair care product out there! It works great. It doesn't leave your hair greasy.,1
Great sample mix. Good mix of lotions and potions.,1
Terrible...this doesn't feel like the original formulation. It burned my eyes and the burning lasted post shower!,0
"Been using this face wash for years, purchased from amazon  in april and something was definitely added to it, smells very funny and made me break out. Tossed it. I suggest using a different seller.",0
"Not impressed at all.  So thick, cant even get on my skin.",0
Consistent good quality.,1
"Strange, large glitter particles in this... not a good look for a mattifying primer.",0
Does not hold...just greasy.,0
"Like a lot of people, I have been looking for the right product for my hair type which is coarse, thick, curly with low porosity, I think its type3c.  What can I say is this product had my hair soft, silky, looked moisturized and it had my curls popping more than every other product I tried before. I like the fact that I can use it as my only product without gels or oils etc. I try to follow the cg method along with using products for my low porosity hair but this was recommended and I check the reviews and gave it a try. It was a good purchase, will highly recommend and re-purchase, in my opinion best leave in for my hair.

New Review

I repurchased this item in a bigger bottle because it worked so good, but I am totally disappointed, it does nothing to my hair, no slip, made my hair feel hard.  So I have this bottle of conditioner on my table doing nothing, I may use it in my twists, but I'm back to treseme.  Will no longer recommend",0
Not really impressed for the price. Doesn't look or perform any differently than other products. I don't see shimmer and it doesn't last.,0
i know the product and love it - however it arrives unsealed and without box etc around it. . kind of makes me feel uncomfortable not knowing if this is the original or some refill?,0
I love this product.  It holds my edges down without feeling too greasy.  It does not flake either.  This is my second reorder.,1
"Wifes review-Very Powerful, drys quick, pistol grip is very comfortable and i never accidentally hit the controls. The exture is perfect for damp hands it does not slip in my grip. Cord is perfect length for wall. Never gets too hot to hold. Drys as well as a 2800 watt. Have owned both Solano and Hot tools professional grade. Both failed with a couple of years. I am very hard on cords. I have very thick 23 inch hair and it dry it in about 5 minutes with this device. Also I have had ceramic and tourmaline and honestly cannot tell a difference. Neither can my hair dresser.
She is having me buy another for a spare.",1
I have roseaca and this moisturizer works and feels great on my skirt n.,1
"This color is great.  Not as purple as the picture of the bottle, but the picture above of the color on the nails is exactly how it looked on my nails.  The color is almost mauve with a gold shine.  I put it on as soon as I got it and have received so many compliments on it.  I absolutely love it!",1
It is WAY too big.  I don't need a iron that big so I returened it.  I also ordered the izunami flat iron 1 inch at the same time which curls hair(loose or spiral) so I retured the curling iron. They don't exaggerate the word jumbo that IT IS!!!!!!!,0
Don't waste your money. This tool doesn't do anything different from a $19.95 curling iron. My tool is losing teeth from the slightest movement or touch. I bought into the infomercial looking for a miracle tool for my hair. This was a disappointment.,0
"so i originally had the SmartBrow from the Dermstore for my eyebrows but it was a bit on the expensive side and i only liked the part of it with the liquid eyebrow liner brush wand, not the spoolie side so it was kind of a waste. once i finished that up i decided to try to find something similar or better and i came across this and decided to give it a shot. This stuff is amazing. it really stays on well even if it gets wet. My Almay makeup remover pads usually remove EVERY bit of makeup off my eyes and brows without a problem, but this Stila eyebrow color gives it a real challenge! Some might find that annoying but i don't mind a little extra cleaning to get it off as long as i know this stuff is going to last me ALL DAY, no problem! I will definitely be purchasing this product again and i highly recommend it!

UPDATE 1/14/14

Ok so ive been using this for a few months now and i still absolutely love it. its stays on so well through any weather or activity you can think of! With daily use it lasts me about a month and a half to two months, but i have very sparse eyebrows so i have to use more than someone who just needs a light fill in, so keep that in mind.

UPDATE 4/4/16 Well its been a few years now guys and i am still using this product for my brows. i have yet to come across anything i like better. This has been perfect for my brows and thankfully they haven't done anything stupid like changing the formula. so, in conclusion... i still highly recommend this!",1
Its nasty. Wont wash off for weeks. Very good smell though.,0
Didn't work for me.,0
"I received Color 04, a beautiful medium pink color.  This product is described on the package as Pro Performance Lip Lacquer, color-drenched long lasting lip lacquer.  It seems to be a hybrid of lipstick and lipgloss, leaning more toward the high pigmented lipstick side.  It has a paint-on brush applicator, similar to a nail polish brush.  The consistency is fairly goopy.  It applies okay but I really do not like this brush applicator.  It would be better with a rigid sponge-covered tip like I have used on some lipglosses in the past.  There is no way I could apply this without a mirror without creating a big mess.  I'm sure it is fine for makeup artists and those who spend a lot of time on makeup, but it is not convenient for those on the go.

After application, I preferred to blot the excess lip lacquer off with a tissue.  There was a lot of product wasted on the tissue - this might get better as I work more with how to use the product (use less).  After blotting, it has a nice satin sheen to it, but not frosted.  It is not a matte finish, in my opinion - I would call it a dewy finish - very nice.  The color was more beautiful after blotting - a nice slightly-blue-toned pink (whereas the product coming out of the package and on the tissue looks a little more neutral or leaning toward brown-toned).  The color is fairly neutral pink and could work for conservative offices, everyday life or going out.

Lips feel moist.  It feels like a lightweight lipstick, has good coverage (somewhere between opaque and sheer) not sticky (after blotting, anyway).  Has a vanilla smell that dissipates quickly after application and virtually no taste.  It seems to be fairly long lasting.  There is a fair amount of product in the container, so it should last for awhile (to justify the higher price).  Typical lipgloss size to throw in your purse or totebag.  Made in Italy.

Overall, I really like the product itself but applicator needs improvement.  Love the finish and how it feels on my lips.  It is different from other lip products I have used in the past (not a lipstick and not a lipgloss) and a definite upgrade from typical drugstore products.",1
i have had my eye on this polish for a very long time.  It is as gorgeous in the bottle as it is on!  the only drawback to a matte finish is that is doesn't last as long as a cream.  easy order and on time delivery.,1
"This is essentially putting Vaseline on your face (""Petrolatum"" is the first listed ingredient, I saw too late).  What an unpleasant surprise.  This cost a lot for a product that is going into the trash.",0
"This shampoo smells amazing and it makes your hair so soft.  I have VERY CURLY WIREY CRAZY hair.  Now all that with some little gray hairs that. I try to keep,blonde ;0).  So when I give a good review on hair products it's from the heart!  I spend fortunes on hair products but now there is no need.  This inexpensive amazing product is now my fav!",1
I didn't care for this.  It left my hair feeling greasy plus it made the floor of the tub very slippery after I rinsed it off.  Wouldn't buy it again.,0
This sponge is not much bigger than a silver dollar.  Not worth $8.50 for the size and you only get one sponge.  I would not buy it again and will be returning this!,0
I stopped getting ingrown hairs when using this right after shaving. I use daily and will likely never stop.  Great stuff!,1
"I had used another products to straigth my hair, but no one like this. I think my life change after this treatment. I don't need to use an iron, anything! I just wash my hair, that's all! I advice to use but with a professional. I love it!!! And i recommend it.",1
"I have REALLY thick, long hair, and it's hard for me to find a hair straightener that will straighten and not fry it. My friend, who's a hair stylist, recommended this, and I love it! It keeps the temperature even while straightening it. And I love that it doesn't make my hair smell burnt. Also love that you can adjust the temperature settings (for when I want to use it as a curler on my hair). Highly recommend it for anyone who has thick hair.",1
Great product for my wavy hair. I live in a dry climate and it really helps control frizziness.  I have used it for over 2 years now.,1
Smells good helps beard lay down a little no more itch.,1
"This is a light and airy cream that works well over other moisturizers or on its own.  I found that it had a very slight floral scent.  That caused me not to be able to put it on my face for worry about the fragrance.  It is a very mild scent.

The lotion blends in easily without using a sticky residue.",1
I got the sample and really did like the lotion but then I read the reviews about the strong scent and now the scent bugs me too! Its super sweet like cotton candy.  Its not really strong but its not a scent that I like. Floral or unscented would be way better.,0
Gift. Recipient loves it.,1
"After almost one month of using this product morning and afternoon, I felt no improvement in my skin, it was very frustrating to realize that I paid a lot of money for a product that does not bring any benefit. I definitely do not recommend.",0
I love love love this color of OPI. This is my second bottle.  It's green but can look brown or gold too. All regular colors for me.,1
"I've tried about 10 different hair oils because it cuts back on conditioner use and build up. I have fairly fine wavy hair that tends to get oily if not washed at least every other day. However, I still need something to soften and detangle that can be used daily. This is by far my favorite! The scent is light and sweet and I only need two pumps and my hair is past shoulder length. I get a beautiful shine like hair commercials with out it looking oily or greasy. I received a sample in a birch box and also when I bought the brand ""love"" conditioner from amazon (also a favorite).  The price is also right for this product.",1
ok product,0
"This helped my skin so much! It's very gentle and smells good, but more importantly I stopped breaking out after using this, then when I ran out and used a different face wash, I broke out again, this stuff worked miracles",1
"I bought this iron as a replacement for my chi (which didn't get as hot over time) and on a friend's suggestion.  This iron does have some positive attributes.  The Iron gets very hot, the plates are extra long, and I can straighten my hair in short period of time.

However, for some reason this iron leaves my hair looking fluffy and unhealthy.  With the Chi, my hair is soft, silky, and shiny, but with this iron my hair does not feel very soft, and as mentioned before, it's fluffy looking, and not in a good volumized way.  I've tried varying the heat settings, but it always looks the same.  In the future I'll stick with the Chi.",0
"love this perfume, and got it for a really great price! I have gotten half this amont for only 10$ cheaper @ tj maxx",1
"I liked this.  I didn't love it.  If I pay $25.00 for a mascara, you better believe I would love it. I usually buy Boots mascara at the local Target.

I have sparse, skimpy eyelashes.  I have problems with allergic reactions so it was with a great deal of trepidation that I tried this.  I used it for a week at work (I work in school).  The weather fluctuated between cold (36 F) to warm (75 F).  It rained and it was windy and sunny.

It didn't cause any reactions.  The volume was there and the color was consistent.  Removal at night was a breeze.

The reason it didn't get 5 stars was because around 3:00 p.m. I would catch a look in a mirror and I had raccoon eyes.  The wind and rain made me look like I had two black eyes.",1
"I've purchased this many times before, but my most recent order was a huge disappointment. The texture was gritty (like many bits of sand were in it), and grated at my skin when I put it on. Unfortunately, I didn't start using this bottle until a month after I ordered it, so I am unable to return it. Will not be repurchasing again!",0
Really love the scent of this product plus it does add the volume it promised,1
"Cord is way too long, but nice item.",1
"I have short fine hair in a messy cut and this works great to hold a style and give body.  It makes the hair feel a bit sticky nasty ... so it that is important to you (ie, someone is going to be running their hands through your hair), don't use it.",1
"I use this as a spot treatment for pimples rather than a mask. It says you can do that on the packaging. I left it on overnight when I felt a rather large and painful pimple coming on. I covered it with this and went to bed.

The next day, the pimple that was protruding before was flat but still red. Unfortunately though, this product ate through all the healthy skin surrounding it as well. I should have been more precise in applying it ONLY to the pimple, because for the next several weeks, the skin in that spot peeled and was red. Ultimately the pimple never came out, but it caused a great deal of scarring there. The scarring is now gone however, as I use a prescribed retinol gel (Ziana).

If I hadn't left it overnight, I think it would have worked fine. In fact I have used it on a spot for a few hours and wiped it off to great diminishing effect. As a mask it leaves you feeling refreshed and pores clean, so that's another plus.

In sum, if you get this product, beware not to leave it on too long.",1
I had used a different RUSK mousse product but thought this might be better.  I did not like it at all.  It was very watery and I did not like the way it left my hair.  I should have stuck with the original and have since purchased the original one through Amazon too.,0
Not at all what it claims to be.  Don't waste your money.  A round brush hairdryer works much better.,0
Love it. I gives my hair brightness and volume. I've using it for years and never had issues. It works perfect every time with other Moroccan oil products.,1
My go to for 10 years. Do it.,1
Very nice sunscreen / primer. Makes my more mature skin look real nice and smooth without any need for foundation!,1
Delivery time was great. The packaging was fabulous. The actual cologne smell is horrid,0
Love it,1
Great I had a sampler That didn't do it justice. When I get a remark from a lovely lady I will pass it on as 5 star or not  thxs,1
Recomended,1
Love the brush and how smooth my hair looks.  My only disappointment is that the coating on the handle is already starting to wear off.,1
"Not impressed.  Delivery is unstable, hard to apply.  And it made my hair sticky and unmanageable.  Much prefer M. Furterer spray.",0
"I don't know the difference between one base coat and the other. OPI is a great product and it's doing it's job great, so yay!",1
Love the conditioner but this shampoo is drying,0
"Bought this as a gift for my mom. She loves it! Definitely a great purchase and it put a smile on her face. Also, I didn't think it was that heavy, as other reviews stated.",1
"My husband uses this soap and loves it so I keep him ""stocked.""  He really likes the smell and uses the shampoo as well. And compared to where I can buy it in my area, they are priced great here!",1
"Horrible. Makes me break out and I can't return it?
Amazon! I ordered 62 things n past 3 months with you. This is a horrible product! How do I return?",0
I was soo disappointed with this OPI product. My nail polish chipped worse than if I'd not used anything at all. It didn't seem to work as a base OR top coat effectively. I was able to get a refund - thank goodness at $14 for one tiny bottle!,0
"As a professional I find it hard to believe that this is the authentic product, mostly because there is no markup on it and in order for it to be here, someone would have to buy it from a professional since olaplex will not sell to non pros.this is what a professional can buy it for.wouldn't someone want to make a profit. Just saying.if you want to spend your money on it go for it. I just thought someone should try to warn you.",0
"Does not cover gray at all. Might be fine for lighter hair and/or trying to adjust roots that are not too extreme, but my hair is black, this did not even darken my gray roots let alone cover it.",0
"Thought it would provide better coverage than it did. Instead of the Dermablend, I actually use my Revlon concealer - which works as well but blends more easily with other make-up.",0
"super disappinted with this one. love the color. sadly i just can't get it to apply nicely. once i finally got it looking nice, as soon as i put it under the lamp, it withered up. it looked like when you get a fingerprint on tacky polish -- but nothing had touched it. boo! no idea what caused this. i had read others mention ""shrinking"" - maybe that's what it is. i also notice a little bit of clumpiness during application.

am presently soaking off hence no caps as i am irritably typing one handed.

UPDATE-- applied Hollywood after. It worked like a charm. No idea what the story is with the Fedora, but I hope they fix it, because I love the color. As expected, the color's similiar to OPI My Private Jet. Please fix it CND!!",0
"Gorgeous, deep color that looks great on all skin tones. Nice consistency and great shine.  Another example of color and quality from essie brand. Great price from company, too.",1
I'm sure this was intended for men but I'm a woman with a short pixie cut and use pomades for shine. About the only thing I like of this was the very minor scent that wasn't overwhelming. It gave my red hair no shine at all and made it very dull and sticky.,0
"Great hair spray wax, delivered quickly",1
This is the best curling iron I have ever owned!  I love that the heat is adjustable so I can put it at the perfect heat to curl my hair.,1
Just doesn't feel the same as the older version,1
on time and excellent product,1
The handle was plastic (not wood) and the quality was worse than the brush I spent $8 on from Walmart.  I lifted up the pad that holds the bristles and there is supposed to be a Mason Pearson stamp there - well there isn't.  It was a fake and I am returning it.  Guess with stuff like this you need to know your supplier.,0
"Cleanses well. Lovely fresh, mild fragrance. Doesn't strip color.",1
"I seldom wear perfume, but the little bottle with Channel No. 5 got broken in last month's weird windstorm, and I wanted to try something new, more in the classic frame than the contemporary complex scents frame.....but not hopelessly old-fashioned.

I think this may fit the bill.  I like it better than other things I've tried and rejected at the perfume counter at Macy's. But it takes some time to grow in/get used to a new fragrance.  I'll post an update in a few weeks.",1
Very disappointed with this curling iron. I have one exactly like it and this one does not work in my hair and does not get as hot as it should.,0
Love it! And it was half the price of Ulta,1
"The best facial wash!! Gentle,but. Soap thourough. My skin glows.",1
It appears cheap and did not work for me at all. Worst flat iron I ever bought. I resorted to using my old one that works just fine.,0
"Great color,as described and ontime!",1
"The seller delivered as promised. I just have reservations that this product is authentic. I have used Revision (purchased from my physician's office) for several years) with no problems. This product I purchased didn't do the job as the jars I previously purchased. When I checked the Revision website, I found out that Revision only sells through a physicians office. Please be aware of this.",0
Stopped dispensing after 2 uses,0
"I tried a small sample from my dermatologist. It applied nicely and was not greasey. I purchased a jar  for my face and neck. After the third day my face dried out and my neck developed a rash. I saw my dermatologist and she said to write down the ingrediants for future reference. My dermatologist offered to reimburse me, but I gave it to my sister and told her to let me know if she liked it. Not the most expensive, but for me not being able to use the cream was costly.",0
"There's no doubt that this cream is top-notch.  I've used inferior brands (inferior in terms of cost) such as Gillette and Barbasol, and Gillette was pretty good until I tried Proraso.  Perhaps it's my skin, but when I initially applied it, while still providing a soothing effect, the cream maintained a subtle sharpness.  It might've been the combination of the cream and a new badger brush.
Nevertheless, when I shaved I could feel my skin a lot smoother than before.  It might take some getting used to, but I can already tell the superior quality of this product.

A bonus is that it's really easy to clean from the sink.  After a night's shave I thought I had cleaned up all of it from the sink, but the next morning I found clumps I didn't see before.  Thinking it was going to give me a hassle to remove as my previous shaving cream had (Barbasol), I grabbed some toilet paper and pressed firmly across it.  I realized I didn't need to push down hard, and it wiped cleanly off with ease.

I'm sure this product will give me many years of great shaving.",1
"I saw this product on a Pinterest video for makeup tips. It is amazing. Really works to shade & define your cheekbones & jaw line. It is flat matte, no sparkles  just perfect for this makeup tool.",1
Fantastic,1
The BEST leave in treatment for your hair.  Leaves hair soft..not greasy. I noticed the difference in my hair right away. Highly recommended,1
"Great product,  I use the Auburn and med brown together and it definitely does the trick...",1
Love this brush!,1
"Works perfectly! I have this one and the bubble bath one and they work no doubt. This is clear and spreads smoothly - smoother than the bubble bath nail strengthener. I use this first and then apply a base coat. Within a week, I noticed a huge difference. My nails feel firmer and stronger. Definitely will recommend to everyone gals AND guys.",1
"This light foam makes my skin feel clean without feeling dry. I just had a facial peel and am happy to have this product to keep up the maintenance. It is not overly perfumy. If your face gets too dry with soap, you may want to give this a try. This is made for oily skin, so I only use it in the morning when I feel kind of greasy. if you have super dry skin, this foam may not be for you.",1
"I love all the items in this box. The price is a steal. The smell is amazing, as always. One of my favorite Amazon purchases.",1
I thought that I would try this since I loved the blood orange body scrub so much.  I didn't like this one at all.  It leaves a pasty film on your skin.  I didn't get the same smoothing effect as I did with the other fragrance and this once seemed much harsher.  I decided to keep it and use it as a foot scrub so that it didn't bother my skin as much.  I wouldn't recommend this product for regular use or anywhere that may be a bit more sensitive.,0
"I've used this for 9 months, with no positive results.  It smells good, but that's about it.  I noticed my hair loss actually increase fairly significantly over this time.  Not that this caused it, but it certainly didn't help.  On to something else.",0
"I am reviewing the color BUFF.
The only good thing I can say about this product is that when it is on my skin, it is lightweight.
Now the bad. Buff or nude is the colors I usually go with. I have a difficult time getting the right color foundation due to my skin tone and texture. I have dry spots and red undertones in some spots, while in other spots it is oily and nude in color. Then once I find a color that works, it is too mask heavy or not enough coverage to even it out. Buff was okay in feeling light, but it also didn't give me the even coverage I needed. Don't even get me started on how many touch ups were needed throughout the day!
The eyedropper was ridiculous. It could have been a good idea, but the actual outcome of that idea was horrible. The tube/dropper gets gunky and you end up getting more than the drops you are wanting. Too much mess and too little time in the mornings for it.
You are better off trying a different brand.",0
"I have poker straight hair and purchased many irons over the years to make curls. I got the curl but 30 minutes later they were gone. Then I saw the Perfecter Pro Grip demonstration on a popular shopping channel. Amazon has a great return policy so I think, I'll give it a try. All I use is a little root lifter. Following the instructions from the TV show I curl my hair and finish with a light hair spray. Then I go out dancing that night, a sure curl killer. Eight hours later I get home and the curl is still there. And that's not all, next morning I wake up, still have curl. This is a great product! Works for me so I hope it works for you.",1
Loved the nail kit. Made my nails look healthy and professionally done.would recommend.,1
"I have been using the product for years.  You feel protected.  It works best with the entire system.
I recommend the entire line.",1
"He was very cool and has used more than once and liked it a lot
 But I need to training on different types of hairstyles to be skilled in the use of",1
Just what I was looking for! Perfect to melt lipsticks in. Great product for sure. Recommend buying to other makeup artists.,1
Fast Shipping.  Very satisfied with purchase!!!,1
doesnt fit my standard sized blow dryer. be careful!!,0
I am a fan of these ribbon style hair ties but was disappointed that the ends frayed so easily.  I wouldn't buy them again.,0
"Still trying to figure this product out a little bit. Was hoping it would work better without humidity (which makes amazing beach waves for me), but still need to work on it.",1
I was very excited to try this product i love bath scrubs.. But when i received it the container it was already cracked on the bottom nothing seemed to be leaking so i just figured no big deal.. so I go to use it and the scrub is so hard i can barely get any out after digging my nails into the scrub i finally got some. the next morning the smell and residue it left on my skin was awful .. went to give it another try last night i open the container and it was pure oil and slim.. i threw it away and will stick with my 5.00 bath scrub I get from Ulta that works amazing and Makes my skin feel and smell amazing,0
came sticky out the bottle,0
"fantastic for anyone with thinning hair, blends and stays in place makes your hair feel like it once did :)",1
Love hot tools!,1
Doesn't smell good. Doesn't work,0
"This product is so ""perfume-y"" it is totally disappointing. I am used to the cool eucalyptus sent of the hand healer which I have used for a few years now. I bought this JB product figuring they would have a similarly subtle scent that appealed to guys...it is marketed as a guy's product right?. The scent is way too fruity/flowery and smells like your grandma's vintage perfume - yuck! Kind of that rich over-ripe flower smell...gag. So perfume-y I couldn't even wash the scent off. Made my eyes water. Jack, you blew it on this one.",0
I didn't like this product. It was watery and made  my face feel sticky.,0
"have used Kneipp herbal baths in the past...some of these are new or combined scents, look forward to some lovely bathing experiences",1
This sunscreen is pretty good I use it everyday. The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 is because It leaves your skin oily.,1
"I so badly wanted to like this polish.  I am all about wearing pink in October, so I jumped all over this when Cut & Blow offered a good deal on it and its companion polish, Pink Works.  Imagine my disappointment when I tried to wear it last week.  This might be the worst formula polish I have EVER worked with.  Sheer but patchy, lots of dragging, and even after three thin, even (well, as even as I could manage), there were still unevenly-colored spots on my nails.  Such a disappointment.  If you're looking for a pretty pale pink shade - KEEP LOOKING!!",0
"Gray color was too ""steely"" for my hair.  Had to purchase container of white to lighten which helps so color is acceptable, but still not an excellent match.
Wish they had a gray with blonde/tan overtones.",1
"These rollers were a tremendous waste of money.  No matter how long I let them preheat they never get hot enough to curl my fine, slightly wavy, easy-to-curl hair.  The plastic rollers also don't retain heat.  I have a cheapie Remington travel hair setter that works better.  This set is collecting dust on my closet shelf - I've gone back to using my antique Clairol hair setter from the big-hair eighties.  I wish they were still available!",0
"It works, don't tell anyone I use it.",1
Nope! We returned this product because after it came I realized it had additives I didn't want my hubby putting on his head. Read the label.,0
"It worked for me. It takes time and patience, but it works.
I'm light skin and dark hair. I used higher power to achieve the result.",1
"Two stars is of my own fault. I feel I'm not coordinated enough to use this! It's past the return time, so I have to keep. If anybody can give me tips of how to manage using this, I would greatly appreciate it!",0
"This is an excellent sunscreen for face. I have read a million reviews before purchasing. I am extremely picky about sunscreens, but this one i will wear on a daily basis. The only problem i have with this sunscreen is i don't know the amount that I am using is the correct amount. It seems like a little goes a long way, but all articles that i read online suggest me to use at least a quarter teaspoon which i think is a bit too much to cover my face. This sunscreen is not drying or clogging your pores, which is super. And i think it lasts super long time too.",1
"I have been using this product for a about a week. I have very sensitive skin, with episodes of eczema outbreaks so my skin kind of burns after putting this lotion on. I can tell that my skin is healing because the burn sensation has significantly reduced since my first time using the lotion. I am using it in conjuction with the Exfoliating Body Scrub. Together by arms are smoother than they have ever been.",1
"This serum is light and absorbs quickly into the skin.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and works well with my moisturizer.  In comparison to most serums on the market I'd say this serum is top-notch quality for its effectiveness on the skin and price point.  I have used better serums but they were very expensive as most serums usually are due to their ingredients.  The only thing I don't like about this serum is the perfume smell it has when you put it on, does it really need it?  In my opinion it is an unnecessary addition but luckily it fades immediately after application.",1
Divina fragancia,1
Love it every time. Great value. It's arrived sealed in original packaging.,1
"Either poor bottle design or poor formula design. The pump did not work from the moment I opened the box. The product had clogged up the pump. Which makes me think that someone used it before I received it. Why else would there be product in the pump if it were brand new? At first I thought the pump on the inside was black till I soon discovered the product was clogged and turned the whole pump in the inside black and the liquid was filled with small clots, as if to assume the product was old. I can't imagine what this stuff would actually look like or your skin. Because that's all I can do is imagine. Returning for a full refund.",0
Holds and looks very good low shine and can hold for a day but is IMPOSSIBLE to wash out so everything else doesn't really matter.,0
"I finally found the right shade for my skin tone! I recommend using a primer with this foundation, because with me, it is a little dry otherwise. Just a tiny bit of product worked. A co-worker told me my face looked smooth and flawless-so, keeping this one on hand. It's only one ounce, but it should last a long time. Recommended.",1
Sent only lasted minutes. Not typical from retail store purchases. Assume it old.,0
I really expected this to be like a light hold pomade. It is more heavy like a wax. I used to use dfi dtails (which was perfect). This is closer than anything else I have tried to use but it is still too heavy/waxy for me to use. I do like that it doesn't have a strong smell. The value for the price/weight is way off though. This is smaller than most pomades and twice as expensive.,0
"I have used it daily and although I can really feel my skin is softer, I see no loss of my visible lines.  Granted my lines are deep because they are below my eyes and are from eye puffiness that is worse in the morning and then recedes as the day goes on.  I noticed the smoothness of my skin one day accidentally when my hand swiped over that area and I had been using it for exactly 7 days.  You can definitely feel the difference in skin texture if it's adjacent to a place that hasn't had the cream.

The package doesn't really say how often to use it, but I see here on Amazon it says twice a day.  So maybe twice a day would give me a better result. However my face cream routine is only once day and so I fail to do it twice.

The perfume smell is a bit strong at first (I am sensitive to some perfumes) but it dissipates rather quickly.  Really they should've left out the perfume but it works for me.",1
"The formula is a little thin, but its a beautiful color for summer. I use it over a white polish ( like I do with most ESSIE brights) and it looks beautiful.",1
"I received this pack for Christmas, and I'm mad about it - because now I'm addicted! First of all, the strips smell amazing. It feels like a spa wax because of that, and the nice color. The ingrown hair prevention pads DO work. I'm very prone to them, and after using these pads I was totally fine. No ingrown hairs at all. The only problem there is that they STING! It wasn't such a huge issue on my legs, but in my armpits, it was VERY painful to use the wipes. I would say it's worth the pain to not have ingrown hairs, but I'm aware not everyone would feel that way. I should also note that I did not use any of the strips on my face, so I can't attest to how they work there. All in all, I really enjoyed this kit.",1
"Love love love this lotion! It makes my skin soft and clear... It's mosturizing without being heavy or greasy. I got hooked on it after getting a sample in my Birch Box, and now I can't go without it. It arrived quickly and undamaged as well.",1
"Got this palette a day early! It's great and perfect for travel. You can use all the shades as eye shadow and some of them as blush, contour, and highlighters for your face. Super pretty and easy colors to wear. For $19 it's a steal!",1
"Horrible. I should've washed it off the moment I felt the tingling.

Wanted to give this negative star if I could.
My skin is irritated and red the morning after using  as shown in pics.
Started getting those rashes right after I started using.
I worked so hard and spent $$ to achieve clear skin. Thanks for ruining my effort!
For those out there who have sensitive skin, beware of the mint extract. Look how potent the effect is on me!
""This lightweight, daily hydrating lotion for chronically stressed skin goes on with a cooling burst to decongest, detoxify and stabilize your complexion, returning it to its natural, fresh and healthy state. With daily use, skin is fortified and protected from the ravages of stress.""
Lol quite the opposite for me? It ravaged my skin.
Off to the dumpster.",0
"Works up into a nice lather, goes on smooth and even. The menthol leaves your face warm and tingly. I highly recommend.",1
Love Davines but this made my hair feel sticky and that is about all that it did for me.,0
"PROS:  Great salon length cord and strong spring that holds hair very securely.

CONS:  The metal on this iron is NOT ceramic (though it comes up in a ceramic search...?)and not a ""smooth"" type metal.  It PULLS and TUGS at my hair as I pull it through to catch the very ends before I wrap it around the barrel.  It was actually painful to use.  :(",0
"This brand is well known in fashion and with this product in the fragrance caregory they have taken a significant step forward.  My significant other found this perfume to be very pleasant.  She absolutely loved the packaging which builds on the sassy, irreverant characteristics of the JC brand.  The smell is fresh and lively -- not too snobby and not for a pre-teen.  After trying this out, she will definitely try this again.  Definitely recommended.",1
I love AHAVA products and have been using them for decades. So nice to see them with the full product line here on Amazon,1
"I didn't get a chance to enjoy it because when I plugged it in I realized the light kept going on and off. I didn't noticed at first because it was hot when the light was on, but when I noticed it becoming cool....the light was off. The only way I was able to keep the flat iron hot is when I held the cord in a certain position which is very difficult to do while styling your hair. It was obvious that the swivel cord part was defective. I sent it back and the seller is saying that it works ""flawless"" which is a complete lie. If you buy this flat iron and the same thing happens to you, just know that the seller didn't want to fix it and just resold this defective flat iron.",0
"This foundation is normally amazing. I first discovered it through a dermatologist where I received a Fraxel treatment for acne scarring. It gives amazing coverage, is very light and breathable. Will not cause breakouts. I've ordered successfully through Amazon before, however this product is not real! Totally different consistency, coverage and color. I will be returning",0
You do not get amount as pictured and no amount listed in the details. Sham! I ordered expecting the 3.5oz bottles,0
"I really wanted to like this. However, it's just peppermint potion and it didn't help my RLS at all. I'm in my third trimester with awful RLS. It takes me hours to fall asleep, I wake up constantly and kick my poor husband all night long.

I really wanted (and needed this to help). Sadly, it did absolutely nothing for me.",0
"I used to really like this shampoo.  They changed the formula and removed the sulfates, which in concept I like, but it no longer lathers well.  I find that I have to use 2-3x more shampoo to feel like my hair is getting clean.",0
Thiis product is like magic.  I recommend it for women and men.  But don't forget to also order the Toppik holding spray to hold it in.  It should be sold with the item because you can not do one without the other.,1
"I would not purchase another. The attachment does not stay on, it doesn't seem hot enough, and the buttons are constantly hit when using. I like the power and the fact is light weight, other than that not so much.",0
It's more of a liquid not a lotion,1
"I was pretty much satisfied with my previous orders, but this time it seems like not original Paul Mitchell. The bottle is full of water, too liquid and it is not like my previous orders. More over it is not working on the Dry scalp like previous Paul Mitchell.",0
Nice eyeliner and plenty of it.,1
"I ordered his product for stretch marks due to weight loss. Have not used long enough to notice a great change, but noticed it's very moisturizing.",1
"I have a terrible time with my nails splitting and when I saw this product I was so excited to try it.  Well, after using this product my nails split more now than before.  I guess this is just something I have to live with.",0
Conditioner was okay but not worth the cost.  I didn't notice any difference from other conditioners,0
It is my favorite body wash do you carry other fragrance in Milton Brown?,1
I didn't use it until now. It lasted ONE session! Can't believe I`ve wasted my money like this!,0
"I've been loyal to my St Tropez self-tan for some time, but was intrigued by XEN-TAN's line on Amazon.  I recently tried XEN-TAN's face tanner in the Mousse Intense Weekly Tan (Medium) and found the results quite natural, the scent very pleasant and not too tacky when applied to face.
This tanner, however, is geared towards body (and can also be applied to face) and comes in a ""ultra dark"" lotion for deeper tan results.  I was hesitant to apply more than a test area at first, having read some reviews that this particular product's results went a tad orange in tone.

Initial impressions - the scent is really lovely, reminds me of summer with the vanilla scent that isn't too overbearing, termed ""Scent Secure"".  It's a good thing when your self-tanner doesn't smell like typical self-tanner.  I felt the lotion was thick dispensing from the tube, but blended in without much effort.  There wasn't a major amount of tackiness post application -- many lotions I have tried from other brands tended to sit on top of skin and feel uncomfortable, especially in the hotter months.  Being that it's October, this assessment may be a little biased since the room temperature of the application is a little colder and not humid.

Touted on the packaging as paraben free and containing shea butter & green tea extract, there's an added perk of moisturizing the skin -- often self-tanners can leave skin dried out.  Once I've given the XEN-TAN Dark Lotion a couple more uses, I will update further on my observations.",1
"Got this for my daughter who gets greasy hair in the front.  Works well, but is REALLY!!! small.  Predominently corn starch....may be the way to go next time.",1
Great product,1
"This leave-in conditioner just doesn't deliver what it promises. Most of the time I use it (following directions) my hair feels like it has  a coating of cheap, waxy conditioner on it. Also, it has a really strong chemical, faux-herbal scent that just stinks. I'll try to use the rest of the bottle because it was expensive, but would never recommend or buy again. I should have returned it!",0
its the real thing.  i was really impressed. Great deal well worth the money I spend on it. Loved it.,1
"I have been using the Proraso shave cream with great success.  I purchased this ""Soap in the Bowl"" to support a recent vacation as I did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl.  This product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube, I did not experience any break-outs as a result.  This is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates.",1
"I am always a fan of using oil on my face, it is very moisturizing and actually prevents breakouts. However I have cut back on using oil as my pores were looking clogged. I do miss it in winter so I was excited to try this product as it is a mixture of oil and anti aging ingredients.
The oil is nice but I do not like the dropper mechanism. More oil comes out than I need for each use. It is a bit greasy since it is oil but if you use the right amount it doesn't take too long to absorb. I only use this at night with the wrinkle smoothing capsules. I think my skin looks more vibrant, too soon to tell about the wrinkles but at least they aren't worse even though I have been stressed and sleep deprived for the last couple of
months. So if Trump gets impeached soon,I may start to look younger.",1
Overall this works for my hair. Products are authentic. I reached out to the distributor who verified this and they responded quickly to my concerns. A huge plus for them. They replace the products immediately because I felt the smell and feel were off. Thank you.,1
"I have used a lot of different brow products over time, and one thing that I have a difficult time finding is a brow product that does not settle into the skin, pores, or smear while wearing in the day.

I have used the Vincent Longo Blonde Micro Pencil for several weeks now and I have to say that it does not wear well.  The pencil goes in nicely with very fine lines and it is easy to apply and make faux hairs in the brow area.

The color is nice- very close to MAC Lingering or Tarte Taupe brow pencils in color.

The pencil itself is very thin, which means that you have to use a special sharpener.  The sharpener is not attached at all to the pencil, so if you lose it, you are out of luck.  I don't like that feature.

What I have found with this pencil is that despite it looking very close in color to the other two which I have previously mentioned, it does not wear as well.  I have done one brow with this pencil and a different one on the other.  At the end of the day, the other brand is still good, but the Vincent Longo pencil is smeary, spotty, and seems to have settled into my pores a bit too.

I do not have oily skin.

For the price, I don't think that this brow pencil works for me anyway.  Nice color, but very disappointing wear time.  I don't want to have to try that hard with any brow products. I prefer to apply and not have to think about it for the rest of the day.",0
didn't do anything but made my eye itching.,0
"Nice product, lathers very well. The odor is on the light side, slightly reminiscent of Ivory soap. This is a good choice if you do not want a lingering scent.",1
Gave me the most gorgeous glow all throughout my vacation last weekend. Couldn't ask for anything better to set off my tan. Love this!,1
Made my skin feel greasy.,0
... I don't know.. my kid maybe like it..,0
"I do not think this is an actual Mop product. The actual Mop liquid wax was more like a cream, this product is actual liquid, which makes me doubt authenticity.",0
Maybe it is just my skin but this moisturizer made my face REALLY dry. To the point where my skin started flaking around my eyes and mouth. Made my skin feel tight after I applied it and did the opposite of moisturize.,0
My fave!  LOVE the smell!  :)  Great for spring & summer!,1
Made a great gift for a friends birthday! The color is beautiful! I would highly reccommend this product to anyone.,1
Package came and the lotion was everywhere! Like the product but disappointed that I lost some,0
Product was completely crushed when I got it,0
perfect for my hair,1
Paul Mitchell Shampoo Three removes the build up from my hard water. I use a conditioner and when it is finished I'll use P.M.'s,1
"I am unable to get any of the product out of the container onto the applicator. I have used clinque product that is like this and did not have this problem.
It seems old or dry.
I am disappointed and would return it if possible.",0
Price high and product arrived in the hot Florida heat - seems like the product is somewhat broken down now.  Just disappointed for the price - would have been better to buy in store.,0
This shampoo is fake! It's watered down and gives you bad dandruff! I want my money back!,0
"After staying at a Lowes resort and getting use the Devines Momo products, I was hoping to get more of the same. Momo shampoo and  has a wonderful smell and quality. When I got the product here off Amazon, I'm was surprised. There is no way this is the same product. The shampoo is runny, not gel like such as the product I got at the Hotel. And the conditioner is a different consistency. It also smells a lot different. This stuff was not cheap, and I feel like I just got taken for $40. Amazon will sell anything from anyone if it means making a buck. If you are buying the conditioner and it comes in a square tub, Don't! It appears to be counterfeit.",0
"Working good,
Cuting maybe need  be more , close to the skin",1
"I was recommended this by the owner of a salon who loved it for hair regrowth post-cancer treatment and by a woman at another salon who said it was a great product. I'm a man with a significant bald spot that started in my 20s and can be stress, medicine, or mystery cause-related. I have no idea. My doctors don't take it seriously. I used the shampoo alone until gone then bought the full kit. I've used the product a good two years and have seen no difference at all. Not only am I disappointed that it's done nothing (and isn't cheap), but my hair is like straw. It's very dry, frizzy and dull. When it dries, it curls and waves and looks ridiculous. I had to buy a flat iron to straighten my hair out so it looks normal. I've had more nourishment with Walmart-purchased shampoos and hate that I've ""lost"" 2 years to something that didn't help at all. At the least, it could have given me good hair where I DO still have it. I'm going to talk to other doctors/specialists and try something else. Perhaps it's only good for women, but neither salon employee said so to me. Seems hard to find stuff tried and proven on men.",0
Love it,1
I am a professional stylist and nearly every tool I have is a babyliss. I love them!,1
I've used some of their other products and liked them. this was ok. won't buy again because of the results vs price. think there are better options out there. i really like the pca lip balm.,0
"This was my first safety razor purchase. I originally was going to go with the Vikings Blade safety razor but it was out of stock at the time and after reading all the good reviews on the Merkur, and it being cheaper, I decided to purchase this one instead. It worked well and I ended up getting one of the closest shaves of my life and managed to do it without drawing a drop of blood. I do highly suggest using a good shaving cream though like Cremo instead of the regular Barbasol or similar shaving cream from the grocery store. I tried them both, and The regular grocery store brands weren't giving me as smooth of a shave and I did experience more resistance when using them.
Cutting to the chase.......although I did like this Razor at first I am giving it only 2 stars because the first time I dropped it and it hit my sink it broke and was useless. I now own the Vikings Blade safety razor which I think is a much better design and could never break the way this one did.",0
This product adds little shine and if you use too much your hairs will look dirty.  It also has a very strong perfume smell that I don't like.,0
it not good for sensitive skin,0
"I really like this aftershave.  It's soothing, has a distinctive, masculine scent that isn't overpowering, and absorbs nicely.  Unfortunately for me, it also causes me to break out when I use it anywhere near my mouth.  So, I'm having to change brands.  But, that doesn't mean I don't recommend it for others - it's certainly worth trying, but be aware that it may cause issues for a few.",1
Helps and seems to be a good product. Not overly harsh on the skin.,1
"This product is horrible.  It looks and feels like thick, sticky paste in your hair.  Unuseable, and I don't know how this has received positive reviews.",0
this is not an authentic product!!! scent stay on for 2-3 max! and it has a bitter scent to it I've used this very same REAL cologne before and lasts HOURS 8+ even after showering! this is not an authentic product!,0
lovely authentic.,1
Quality  item~ Quality Seller ! Thank you!,1
"I've seen so many changes in the last few months. I will be using this always! Not much is needed. I use a dab of water with MAYBE a dime sized amount day and night and it lasts a long time. In the summer where I am from, it is very humid so I am considering keeping this for the fall or using even less. Nonetheless, I LOVE IT.",1
Didn't have great expectations because the polish seemed rather thin. (Maybe because I've become accustomed to gel polishes?). Put four coats on and it has surpassed those expectations. After 7 days the shine is still there and no chips or wear are showing. I'll easily get three more days out of it so I'm impressed.,1
the wax is too dry and does not stick to skin enough... this is the second time i've tried it and it was the same both times.,0
The color has a purple hue! Disappointed,0
"The texture and the sheerness of this color of Stila Lip Glaze appeals to me.  It is not long lasting like a lipstick and needs to be applied more often, but since I am using it to moisturize and only lightly color my lips, it is ideal for my purposes.  It gives just a hint of color that is much more pleasing to me than other brands of lip moisturizers I have used.",1
It's too thick and doesn't rub in very well,0
Great hairdryer,1
Expensive and doesn't really work...,0
I had received this powder from my ipsy packages and loved it. I was excited to buy it. Unfortunately this arrived without any kind of seal in place. Also there were fingerprint marks on the powder itself clearly thiaprodu t was previously used or otherwise tampered with. Very disappointing.,0
No change or difference on me,0
great for touching up grey between colors,1
"I've used this product for years, my only issue is the bottle leaks in your purse. Really annoying",1
I purchased this peoduct along with the shampoo. I liked this product and I would purchase it agsin. I did not like the shampoo and would not purchase the shampoo again.,1
"i used it a couple of times, but prefer the deep cleanser brush. this is more of a gentle brush",1
Thus product interfered with my vision. Tried using it for a couple of weeks & my eye sight was seriously effected by the use of thus.  My vision was clearly poor with the use of this product,0
I always had problems when shaving. To do it downwards left hair as if I did not shave at all and doing it upwards meant irritation  plus ingrown hairs. My dermatologist suggest me shave exclusively downwards. Something ineffective to get the clean shaving quality I want  but effective for avoding said problems. I decided to give this a try because of all the reviews and some YouTube videos on techniques that seemed to be the right ones . My shaving ended up being same as with any other safety razor. Maybe it is the flat lying hair hard to reach and remove when shaving only downwards.,0
"This file works smoothly, with no rough edges on nails.  It is somewhat sorter than I thought it would be, but the length was clearly stated.  I bought three - one for the house and one for each car.  It is extremely frustrating to be on a road trip and break a nail.  My husband said, ""Good job with the nail files.""",1
Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!! The colors are identical and the formula's great!,0
My husband tried this and did not like it. It is a very thick cream and leaves a sticky residue on his face. It was very bothersome to him so he ended up washing his face with soap to remove the product.,0
"I didn't like this eyeliner at all.
It doesn't go on smooth.  It doesn't perform the way a gel-liner does.  It seems very waxy.",0
"Just what I was looking for , no more shinny face ,  ",1
"Worked great for the first few uses, but then it began to crumble apart so it failed way before it was used up.  For the price it shouldn't prematurely fail.",0
"I've used this brand of hairspray for years.  It has a good hold without being stiff or sticky, and it gives my hair a little extra sheen.  It has a pleasant odor that doesn't include a chemical smell like alcohol or varnish.",1
"Enjoyud this soap at a friends house and wanted it for my home.  Perfect for kitchen, bath, whatever; the fragrance is gentle and the soap doesn't leave that dry feeling.",1
really like it but BEWARE USE A MOISTURIZER WITH IT. it can be very drying without it. with moisturizer it feels really nice and non greesy. good tint color too,1
"I am always looking for a good, solid mascara. This one does the trick! I do wish it would last a bit longer, but I hear you are supposed to change out your mascara every month- this definitely lasts longer than that.",1
Was not happy with this dryer. Returned it after just a couple of uses. It does not get hot enough to straighten my curly hair. Was not pleased at all.,0
"This has not cleared up my acne at all and my acne isn't even that bad and I use it exactly as instructed so really disappointed because it had so many great reviews. It also is not a very good make up remover as claimed. I do like that it doesn't irritate my skin like some zit creams do, but wouldn't recommend for a face wash to remove acne.",0
"overall I like this product and it does seem to help the skin both above and below my eyes.

The primary issue I have is that the dispenser pump is difficult to modulate and I usually end up with far more product on my finger than I need for both eyes. That's important considering how much the product costs.
I know it seems like a little issue but its been frustrating to try hard to push down just enough to get the amount you want but then getting too much when the pump goes too far.

The product itself is good.  Goes on easy and disappears quickly.  I do notice a difference from the other eye products I have used.  It seems to make the skin look smoother and lighter.",1
Smell doesnt last long i think i got a fake. However it does smell good just wish it lasted longer,0
Arrived half empty.. trash !!!!,0
"This was recommended to me for my rosacea, but it seemed like it irritated my skin instead of calming it. Going to try a different spray.",0
"I used this for about a month.  During this time, my face gradually broke out worse than when I was 15 years old and working at a fast food restaurant.  I didn't think it could be this product because it has acne medication (salicylic acid).  But, I quit using it, and sure enough it gradually became better and two weeks later, not a zit in sight.",0
"Very nice lip scrub.  I like the wide choice of favors.  Packaging cute, but a waste of materials as it just is discarded.",1
Didn't seem to help my wrinkled neck. It was probably too late for me.,0
Doesn't smell as good as the gel,0
"I enjoy doing gel polish on my nails myself. This doesn't last AS long as getting them done professionally but pretty close. It looks and feels like they do from the salon but usually peel off after a week. They polish looks great. The only reason I took one star away is because at first I had trouble getting the polish to cure. Then I learned you have to do the base coat, cure, 2 coats of CND polish, cure, top coat, cure and then lastly put rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab and rub over nails and that will help them to cure instantly.",1
"this dries up the zit overnight. however, you need to use dark spot remover the next morning to fade the mark.",1
"After reading some of the one star review, I know I am not the only one. This eyeliner is my all time favorite brand, until I bought one from here. I trusted Amazon so that I did not pay attention to the package. But I notice the difference the first time I used it. It's much harder to apply than all my previous ones. Its like an used one that most of the ink is gone, or something like that. I shakes it , pressed it, but nothing helped. I only used for few weeks and it drove me crazy every morning. Stila never had products like this before, so I decided to read reviews to find out why. I guess this is faked product or expired ??? I donot know , but just donot buy it from hete. This is not the same stila!!! Be aware!!",0
"I'm 27, and still suffer from bad acne, as well as some intermittent cystic acne. I've long since stopped hoping for a cure, and just hope to keep it managed. I'm pleasantly surprised by this! I had low hopes it would do anything at all.

While it doesn't completely take away a cystic bump, it shortens it by quite a lot, and keeps it from getting as painful. Instead of hanging around for a week or several, it's more like a few days. Because they don't get as large, they also don't scar as much. The smell isn't great, but no worse than others and is gone very quickly.

I didn't think it was more drying than other acne medications, but it might be if you have very sensitive skin or used it too much. I use it after my moisturizer twice a day only on active bumps. Very happy with it and will continue to use!!",1
"I ordered this dryer because BaByliss has a good reputation, and everyone else seems to like it. So I was kind of surprised to find myself hating this hair dryer...

Pros:
Hot is hot
Good power

Cons:
Heavy
Really loud
Vibrates a lot

Because it's heavy, it tends to slip in my hand until I am pressing the blue cold air button. I feel like I'm fighting with it all the time! Needless to say, I will be looking for an alternative...",0
streaky!,0
"The product is almost a drab gray in the bottle - not especially attractive.  However, it goes on clear, is smooth, dries quickly and lasts far longer than regular polish.  It is matte with just a hint of shine to keep your nails looking cared for.  There is no chipping or flaking, it must just gradually wear off but is really unnoticeable.  For a very natural look, it's the best I have found.",1
"I purchased this tool on a different website but I have to say this tool didn't work for my medium length naturally curly and frizzy hair. Ive tried it several times using heat protector products but each time, my hair came out looking dry and fizzy. I think it might work better for short hair. It makes my hair look damaged, so no its not good for me and I cannot return.",0
Excellent during winter months due to skin dryness.  Expensive but worth it.,1
Arrived broken.,0
"It's a pretty mild formula that works very effectively. It smells nice, unlike most nailpolish removers. The only thing I don't like about it is the pump sometimes squirts too much onto my cotton pad and it can oversoak it.",1
I received it half used!!!!,0
The BaByliss Pro Straightening Iron performs miracles on my thick hair. I love the temperature control and the size is perfect for handling.,1
"I was only able to u se about 1 inch of the 6 inch pencil.  It does not sharpen!  When I emailed the seller, I got no response as to how to sharpen the pencil!  VERY disappointing.",0
"Received a defective item. I have another babyliss ceramic curling iron which I love to death. I bought this as a replacement since my first one was bought overseas (I have to use a converter everytime I use it). The box came damaged, the plastic tip looked dirty, but I smelled it, and it didn't smell like hairspray or anything so thought I'd test it out. Turned it on high and let it warm up - waited 15 min, and it was still only warm. Waited another 10 min.. and it still didn't heat up! This item looked like it was a return from a previous customer. I love my other babyliss curling iron but am extremely disappointed with this one!",0
First of all my disappointment started when I opened the package. The white olaplex package was in a brown one and that was in an Amazon package. Well the white package was wet in one corner and when I opened it I noticed that the seal on the no 1 bottle was just laying on loose and the cup wasn't screwed on properly. Some of the olaplex leaked. It was just a bit and I really needed to bleach my hair so I decided to not send it back and just use it. I regret I ignored that first red flag cause when I wanted to use it I noticed that the olaplex no 1 smells different from the original ( I have used olaplex twice before) it was also runnier than what I used before. Another red flag but I decided to give it a try anyway. It didn't do what it was suppose to do at all. No difference in bleaching my hair. So I came to the conclusion that this is not the real olaplex. I still tried the olaplex no 2 in the hope at least this will be the real one but nope it's not. It didn't make any difference at all. I am sooooo disappointed! I will keep buying from my hairdresser this is a fake product!,0
"This smells nothing like the stuff you buy at the salon. It has a weird baby oil smell to it. It works pretty good as far as reducing frizz and making hair easy to comb through, but the smell is terrible. Very disappointed :-(",0
Very nice scent. Lathers up well. My only complaint is the lid is snap on not threaded.,1
Ordered at the end of March and it burnt out just yesterday (7/14/2014). It didn't even last 6 months and I can't return it or have it replaced.,0
"Worked somewhat, didn't help with pimples or zits but did help with small white heads.",0
Liked cologne smell but doesnt last long more than 4 hours. I had John Varvatos purchased from Macy's which lasted almost all day even when I do laundry I could still smell it.,0
It has a very strong smell and its a medium hold for a mustache.,0
Doesn't do what I expected!,0
Excellent German craftsmanship. Ditch the Gillette and shave like a man.,1
"It was okay. It straightens well. I don't know how to use it, but I got a pretty good deal. I didn't like that after it was delivered, it was left outside my apartment door.",1
not the best,0
Eh I wasn't that impressed I lightened my dirty blonde hair a few days prior and my hair came out with orange tones. I was hoping for better results I used it six times and didn't see much change if any. I had to stop using it due to my hair started falling out o_0 I am now trying to undo the dryness caused from using this product every 3 days.,0
It run off,0
Brush is never the same as described on the image.. a friend purchased it and it didn't even come with a brush ahah.,1
I love this eye cream. It is not as cooling as their antidote lotion that I normally use.  It has a nice texture--pretty thick. It does not irritate my sensitive skin.,1
"This is not glytone essential rejuvenating cream although deceivingly similar packageing.
Much thinner, doesn't absorb as well and no glycolic acid tingle. I thought maybe they had changed their packaging but not the same product",0
Use the product for over two months but didn't see any visible improvements. Still looking for a facial cleanser to help with exfoliation.,0
"I had high hopes for this mascara but was a bit disappointed.  It goes on well. The effect both thickened and lengthened with only a sigle coat.  It wasn't gloppy.  I was pleased upon application but as I wore it throughout the day, my eyes began to feel scratchy and irritated. I wear contacts, and no amount of eye rewetting drops or rinses to my lenses relieved this irritation.  I did not see tubules in my eye area, thinking the tubes might be slipping off into my eyes and irritating them, but none were visibly present.  It washed off in the shower later that evening and I didn't wear it for a week after that.  Then, a week later, to give it a fair shot, I tried again.  I went on well as before.  I'm careful as always not to get any in my eyes, et cetera.  But lo and behold, a number of hours later, there began the subtle scratchiness that would progress into irritation.  Keep in mind I wasn't doing anything on either day I wore this mascara that might have contributed to this irritation. I didn't attend the gym on those days, sweat alot, use a sauna, walk in the rain, rub my eyes (I'd never do that anyway)or anything else that might have caused irritation.  The second time I wore it in fact, I had a new set of contacts in...  Well, one caveat; I found I can wear it successfully sans contact lenses (glasses instead).  But that means I rarely, rarely wear it and it was a waste of money for me.  In short, I recommend it IF you don't wear contact lenses.",0
no comment on this one,0
Its too obvious when worn,0
"Seriously, I am so surprised that there are any positive reviews. I followed the instructions precisely.  I am thin with only a little neck uplifting needed.  NOTHING!  THAT THE RESULTS.  JUST A WASTE OF TIME!  So, perhaps it works only on people who need to lose 10 pounds in their neck.  DON'T WASTER YOUR MONEY even though it is cheap, lol.",0
Broke first time I used it.,0
loving the fresh scent,1
"In the online photo it looks like a dark taupe, but in person it appears an extremely dark, blackish brown; I doubt it would look ""grey,"" or even taupe, on the skin. Since I didn't touch the shadow itself, I was able to return it free of charge by UPS drop-off.",0
"I really don't care for this scent. The jasmine barely registers. It smells too soapy (almost dusty), too.  I'll stick with Lush's jasmine fragrance instead.",0
"Excellent product! I love how this little machine works. My face has never felt so smooth and clean. I use the deep pore cleansing brush only in the evenings to remove all elements from the day to be sure my skin is the cleanest it could be.
Thank you for this wonderful product!!",1
"A little bit of this stuff goes a long way. I use this both with a badger tail brush as well as with my bare hands (both are for shaving my head). Was using the same product (shaving soap) and loved it. Felt like i was wasting some each shave so decided to get this. Just as good if not better. Excellent product, will be recommending to everyone and will buy again for sure.",1
"Since I have green eyes, I like to use purple and pink eyeshadow to enhance them, so I ordered this eyeshadow duo in Shade 06. (For reference, I normally use Tarte eyeshadows, which I love.) The colors are pretty, but I will not buy from this company again. First of all, the compact is very tiny. That may be a plus for travel or to tuck into a small handbag, but then you would also need a brush or applicator because the duo does not include one. Secondly, the product goes on very light, and you have to keep building it up, which takes a lot of time. The pink makes a nice highlighter for under the brow bone, but the purple is barely visible. You have to get your brush wet to get any color to show up. Third, the case is very difficult to open. You have to get your nail under the catch and risk breaking or cracking a nail. For a little more money, I could buy a Tarte eyeshadow quad and get twice as many colors with a much better quality. This product is more comparable to a drugstore duo than a higher end brand. I don't think it's worth the cost.",0
The purple color is great but the liquid eyeliner dries out and it's tough to use,1
"Great price. The fragrance isn't exact, hut good enough for a body spray. It's not as long lasting as I'd like it to be, but other than that well worth the price.",1
"I don't know what the deal is, but this isn't the same kind you get from a beauty supply store.... My hair felt so dry.... I gave it a couple weeks and still am disappointed.",0
"I have the regular curling iron that isn't ceramic and it curls great.  However, I wanted to get a larger size and wanted to protect my hair but no mater what I do, I can't get product to hold a curl.  It does get hot so I can't figure it out.  I ended up ordering the BaByliss Pro Ceramic.  I will be sure to rate it.",0
"I ordered a 1.5"" curling iron and received a 1"" curling iron.  I didn't realize it until my daughter opened her gift (It was a Christmas present which was even a bigger disappointment).  Anyway, I am having the hardest time returning this item.  I followed the Amazon links for returns but they are just one drastic circle.  This vendor does not follow up with you after the purchase which is another disappointment.  I have no contact information for them so I can't contact them directly. I will try contacting Amazon customer service again today but this is exhausting!",0
This works very well on my fair skin! Use a light hand and you can build to your desired darkness. It has a great BROWN (not orange) color that won't make you look like an oompa-loompa. I recommend it for any and all skin tones.,1
"I ordered this in the light blonde color. Right out of the tube you can see that it has a slightly green tint, but I was hoping that it would end up blending in with my eyebrows. Unfortunately, it made my eyebrows glow a soft green color all day, so I am returning it.",0
Nice design and does its job. OK price.,1
Used this once and it made my daughter's KP possibly the worst I've ever seen it. I want my money back. $40 for something I'll never be able to use.,0
"I use and love Stila eyeliner, so I was eager to try the eyebrow color.  I loved it, but it was all gone, in about three weeks.  I couldn't believe that it was already empty.  I don't use that much and in comparison, the eyeliner lasts a long time.  Very disappointed.  I'm wondering if I got a defective product.  Certainly, it should last at least a couple of months",0
"The USL by Uslu Airlines Nail Polish is a brand that I haven't used before but I was willing to give this brand of try since I love nail polish. This is a nice shade of red but I was expecting a the nice and beautiful taupe or olive color but I guess the shipment was somehow mixed up. The color applies well to the fingernails and lasts a long time without chipping and that's a plus for me because I work on a computer everyday and that means this a high quality nail polish.  I love how smooth this polish applies and I love the glossiness of this nail polish.

I will have to try other colors to see if they are the same but as for now I like this brand.",1
Doesn't seem like a mask...feels more like a moisturizer or cleanser. Disappointed...won't buy again.,0
Very pretty color,1
"Not at all what I expected. It seems to straighten only the hair in the middle of the plate. Also, it is constantly snagging the hair as you slide and often breaks the hair strand off. It's actually the worst flat iron I've EVER bought AND it is a non returnable item! Don't waste your money.",0
Love the color and it wears well.,1
"I kind of like this, as it controls my oily skin pretty well. Will continue to use it. Just need a good sunblock.",1
"The only reason this gets two stars is because it has a decent SPF.  As a primer, I hate it.  It's either gone too dry or it's ""normal"" for it to be very difficult to get out of the container.  I do NOT recommend!  I should have returned it.",0
"I could only say limited things because I haven't had it long enough, it seems to be clearing up my daughters face. It seems like a good product , so far so good.",0
Smell doesn't stay with you.  I am having a hard time accepting this as an original.,0
"Fast shipping, but DOES NOT look like how it does in the picture. The one I received is clear, with not even a trace of pink in it. The writing is off on the bottle, the handle is smooth which authentic OPI bottles have a textured handle. There's no OPI printed on the top of the brush (all authentic OPI should have one). The brush is very flexible, which authentic OPI brushes do tend to bend a bit, this one bends WAY too much. I fear I have a fake. Extremely disappointing, especially because I paid almost $7 for it. Buyer beware!",0
Works like dry shampoo. Gives texture to fine hair - makes it 'hold' in braids and twists much easier.  Good product!,1
This product is fantastic! I am a big fan of Paul Mitchell products but this by far is my favorite. A little shampoo goes a long way and leaves a great shine to the hair. If you use it over longer period of times it helps with split ends. Definitely would recommend this product to my friends and family.,1
I did not like the squareness...not sure of the purpose.  I replaced it w/a large round,0
"Ordered the fair one and it looked ghostly. My husband said it looked like a clown because it was so white. I didn't even put very much on. I can't imagine there is anyone pale enough to wear fair. Needless to say, I'm returning it.  However, it was lightweight and felt good. Great idea and I really need this but I'm hesitant to order a different shade for fear of color issue.",0
"I must have missed the boat on this as the other reviewer wrote that the smell was so delicious? I don't think this smells very much at all, and certainly nowhere near delicious? It doesn't give me any volume, but doesn't weigh my hair down either. Not sure what it does, but i continue to use it. L'Occitane volumiser spray much better",0
This is the ONLY face scrub I've found which legitimately scrubs the face. It's got tough scrubbing action!,1
Disappointed to receive wrong product. Discovered after applying to hair in shower. Product with very potent smell of peppermint left scalp feeling tingling sensation. Ended up gifted it to a friend.,0
"I don't know about anyone else, but this peel adhered to my face and felt like i was waxing my entire face in slow motion when I was trying to remove it.  I followed the instructions and put a thick layer on and let it dry.  This was one of the most painful experiences of my life. I've done many peels and have never had an experience like this.  This was the absolute worst.  I will say that, after the painful removal process, and the tingling subsided after about two hours, my skin did look luminous.  I'm suspecting that is because I ripped off a layer of skin.",0
Love the way this soap smells. Not 5 stars because after using it daily for a couple of weeks my skin has become very dry.,1
This product is not cheap but the feel and quality feels really cheap. I have not used it because I do not like how it feels. So light and cheap quality.,0
I love this cream.  It is actually between a serum and a cream.  It is light and it does not weight my hair down.  I love the fragrance.,1
"This full coverage foundation stick is amazing. It could be used as regular foundation, but I have been using it as a concealer. I occasionally have a break out on my upper chest area. I don't typically put makeup on my chest, but when I have a pimple there it becomes really inflamed and noticeable. It remains like this all while it heals too. I just want my chest to look all the same color. So, I have been using this stick to cover up the two red scabs (currently, previously pimples) there. It is so easy and it does a fantastic job!

All you have to do is rub the stick across the area. I personally like to blend it more, so I use a beauty blender to blend it in. Another great thing about this stick is that it is build-able. You could easily add another layer if you need darker coverage. It makes my pimples/ scabs disappear and blend with my skin. It also does not irritate them or make them worse, which is a huge plus. I highly recommend this foundation stick.",1
"No hold. I don't know what Jack Black is thinking with their ""Max Hold"" products, as they all seem to be more like ""a little bit of hold"", whereas their ""strong hold"" products are pretty sturdy.

I mean there's not much else to say. I used more than should be necessary, and I could barely tell I had anything in my hair. The level of hold is almost nonexistant. Even with very short hair and a large amount of product, this did absolutely nothing to hold my hair in place. It's about as much help as rubbing lotion into your hair- sure that'll weigh down the follicles a bit, but that's all you're getting.

But, there's nothing offensive about the product. It smells fine and it doesn't harm my hair. The finish is good. So I can't take all points off, but close to it.",0
Used this five times and it just stopped working.  Piece of junk.,0
the smell is very strong and it doesn't smell like the other mustela products. I never used this on my daughter.,0
"This really works wonders. It seems pricey for the quantity, but really all you need is just a squirt the size of a penny to get the forehead/nose/cheeks. I was really surprised at how my skin stayed oil-free but not dry. Definitely recommending this to friends.",1
Paid way too much for mascara that hardly comes out on the wand.  It is neither an extender or volumizer.,0
Very Satisfied!,1
"Had it for a couple of months.  It was great, then stopped working.  Liquid stopped coming out. Very disappointing.",0
"I had the previous packaged bottle.

The new package smell less strong than the previous one, which is good.
Good moisture and doesn't take long for the skin to absorb.",1
I'm still waiting for the results after a month.,0
"Both my daughter & I have fair complexions. This product is great for neutralizing the redness we sometimes get around the nose during allergy season. My daughter also sometimes uses it for blemishes though it's not her first choice. Also, it's saved me a time or two from looking like a raccoon when I got too much sun while wearing sunglasses. Wouldn't recommend for anything other than fair to maybe medium fair skin. Good product for the pigment challenged!",1
Beautiful color!,1
"I'll start out saying that I did not buy my Mia 2 from Amazon but I'm leaving my review here because I always tend to check out Amazon for reviews.  I purchased my Mia 2 from Herbergers when I had stopped in to purchase more Clinique face wash.  I had been using Clinique face wash for over a year and for some reason it just wasn't working anymore.  The girl at the counter told me about Mia 2 and being a 40 yr old with a break-out that wouldn't go away, I decided to spend the money and give it a shot.  The girl had a couple coupons that brought the price down and made me feel slightly better about spending the money on it.

I've had problems with breakouts for the past 10-12 yrs and have tried countless different face washes without success until the Clinique. Then that stopped working. This latest breakout was along my jawline.  I have a problem with oily skin all month long but its especially bad during my cycle. I've been using the Mia 2 for a little over 2 weeks now and initially I had little extra breakout spots, which I expected as the extra junk rose to the surface. Nothing big.  The breakouts along my jawline, I THINK, are finally starting to heal. Is it clearing up because of the Mia 2 or the cleanser?  Don't know that.  I can tell that the pores on my nose and chin are smaller and I'm sure that's because of the Mia 2.  Happy about that.  We'll see what happens with my next cycle.

I also used this on my 9 yr old who has a problem with white heads on her nose and blackheads on her chin.  After only a few uses, we could already see a difference in her skin.  So for that, we both feel it's worth it.

What I don't like about the Mia 2:
I don't like the timed shut off.  I don't like that I only get one minute to wash my face and I don't see the point in the little beep that tells me to switch to a different spot on my face.  I get that it's so I can get the most out of that one minute but if it didn't have that one minute time in the first place they wouldn't need the stupid  beep.  Most days, I feel I need more than a minute so I'm hitting the button to use up two one minute cycles.  What if I'm having a particularly bad day and feel I need to wash extra or have an extra large face?  Or, in my case, I need to wash my jaw line and part of my neck so that's not included in the spots they tell you to wash for a certain amount of time and therefore I run out of time when washing my face and the thing shuts off on me.  Frustrating.

The second speed is pointless.  I honestly cannot tell any difference between the first and the second speed but I still hit the button twice. I guess it's psychological. It must be going faster if I'm hitting the button twice, right?!

The battery life totally SUCKS!  The instructions say that you should charge it for 24 hrs before the initial use.  Like most battery opperated items you buy, that's normal.  So then I read that I can expect 24 minutes of use out of a full charge.  Serious?!  That's it?!  So if I'm using two one minute charges morning and night (not including if I use it on my daughter), that's only going to give me 6 days of use!  What a crock!  To top that off is the charging time.  It's almost as bad as the initial charge.  I went to use it one night and it was dead.  So, I popped it on the charger before I went to bed, not knowing how long it would take to charge, I figured it would be ready for me to use the next morning.  Nope, it was still charging when I got up! Came home from work and it was STILL charging!  Pulled out my instruction manual to see what it said about charge time and I read that it takes 18 HOURS for additional charges!  Again...SERIOUS?!  Isn't there a rapid charger or something?!  Depending on when I put it on the charger, that's like 2-3 face washings I have to miss for a charging.  I just have a hard time believing that for the amount of money this thing costs they wouldn't put better battery in this thing or give you a better charger!

So those are my thougts on it.  I'm fairly satisfied with the results and won't be returning it but had I known ahead of time the things I know now, I don't know if I would have spent the money on it.  I'm certainly not rich and struggled with the decision to buy it because of the cost.  I will update again in a month or so to let you know how things are going.

Update 12/1/2013...so after using for a couple months but before my 90 days was up, I just wasn't seeing the results I wanted to see in my breakouts and decided this was too much money to spend on something that was going to sit in my drawer and not work so I contacted Clarisonic to start the return process.  To Clarisonics credit, they didn't question my return or give me any trouble. I had to email them a copy of my receipt and within two days they emailed me a UPS shipping label to return the product. So we'll see how long it takes me to get my refund check. They said it could take up to six weeks but hoping it doesn't take that long.",0
I tried this perfume in the Netherlands and loved it because it lasted so long even after going in a hot tub but this did not even last 5 hours very disappointing,0
"This stuff really works-- I bought this four months ago and I have definitely seen a noted improvement in the lines in my face. I use a little bit before I go to work every morning and I can definitely see the difference even just after a few hours of putting it on. Also, the product lasts a very long time, so if you're worried about getting your money's worth, trust me, you will. You only need a little bit to cover the entire face. Great product in my opinion.",1
Ugly color,0
"I never read the ingredients for this and the whole time I've been using it I've been thinking ""I think this is just castor oil, with maybe a little bit of something else."" Sure enough I read the ingredients and the first ingredient is Castor oil! It has a little bit of other stuff but does that really make much of a difference? This tiny 2oz bottle of oil is $25 and a 16oz bottle of castor oil is $13. Now you tell me which is a better deal. I'll just stick with the castor oil. See attached picture. On the left is a dab of this pre shave oil and on the right is a dab of castor oil. Looks the same and feels the same. Don't waste your money on this expensive pre shave oil.",0
Was really wishing this would work even a little but didn't see an any kind of difference. Felt a little tingling and hope that meant it was working some magic but I was let down.,0
don't buy!,0
I love the tinted moisturizer,1
My favorite pomade.  Holds my hair very well and leaves a nice shine. No reason to use another pomade after you try this one.,1
"I'm still not sure if you're supposed to spray on before or after straightening, but doing it before and after seems to work.  I saw some people didn't like the smell, but I found the smell to not be bad at all, just smells like a hair product like you would smell in the salon.  It does make hair shinier. I hold a few inches away from my head and spray real quick cause if you spray too much too close it does seem like it could make hair look greasy. I like it works great!",1
"I really really wanted to love this product. It did apply beautifully, and it didn't budge until I removed it. However, I barely got to enjoy it, because the cover kept popping off in my makeup case, and it completely dried out. I'm very disappointed in this massive design flaw. I hope Stila fixes this issue.",0
This product BaByliss line is actually by Conair.  I think it is a good curling iron for the price range.  I like that it has a red and green light that flashes so you know when it is fully heated when it changes to steady green.,1
"This works on everything with keratin, nails, too.",1
"Like the shave gel better  without  the hot towel.
The hot towel  treatment  caused my razor to drag and clog.
Did little  to soften  my beard.
The other stuff is fine including  the after shave treatment.",1
"I loved this product. I have my mother's large-pore combination sensitive Irish skin. It never looks super-clear because of the oil but -BONUS- it ages so slowly that the ladies in our family look awesome through their fifties. For years, I've used mud masks from Borghese and Aveda to clear pores.

This powder functioned like a MUCH stronger mud mask. Even stronger than ProActiv's spot mask. Stronger not in irritation but in drying effect. It dried so much that it flaked on my clothing near the end of it's drying period. Know that if you're wearing black. This said, I appreciated the strength of it for my T-zone. I wouldn't use it on the whole face, but it would be fantastic for teenagers in the super-oily stage or anyone going through a hormonal change that's blocked up their skin.

I'd also like to put in an unsolicited plug for virgin raw coconut oil for use as a moisturizer by all skin types. It's anti-bacterial and has a soothing effect on my super-sensitive skin, even when it's oily already.",1
Would not recommend.  Did not like.  Still haven't used.  Disappointed.  Doesn't really get hot.,0
"Like many others, I also received what I suspect to be fake Strivectin; it was so different from the other 2 tubes that I had used. The consistancy, color, and scent were all different. When I very closely compared the tubes, they were different too, with small variations in the words, pink stripes, etc. and yes, it was more drying, not as creamy and just did not feel as nice. What made me suspicious though was that when it arrived, there was no box, no brochure like the previous tubes.

Soooo....I called Strivectin. Weeks ago I might add. I began by asking if they had any information on any possible fake products being sold. I was told to always buy the products from an authorized distributor (if it's being offered for sale, how am I suppose to know if it's an authorized distributor and there was no answer for that question). I gave the rude and unhelpful lady the code from the tube and asked her if she could check to make sure it was an authentic code number at least. She took the number and said she would call me back (gave her my name and phone number). Days later I called them again and asked why I hadn't received a return call. The lady I spoke to that time was at least pleasant. She took my information again and while on the phone she said she was e-mailing another department to get the answer expedited for me and I should have a call back the following day. It has since been 3 weeks. I know ED said that he got all kinds of information from them. I guess I spoke to the wrong folks there!  If the formula has changed and this is what it will be from now on, JUST SAY SO STRIVECTIN. Tell all of us who call!! If it will be sold as just a plain tube without a box and brochure then tell us that too!! As it is, we don't know what we have. FAKE OR AUTHENTIC??? They should at least know their own product codes. I WOULD LIKE AN ANSWER FROM THEM. AFTER ALL, CUSTOMERS AT LEAST DESERVE ANSWERS. WE ARE THE ONES KEEPING THEM IN BUSINESS, so I expect a return call as promised.",0

Made my eyes itch terribly. Allergic to something!,0
"terrible idea, buying perfume off amazon when you don't know what it's going to smell like. This was... well, I didn't like it. not sweet or warm enough for me.",0
"Nail polish bottle was broken. Opened packing & nail
polish went all over! What a mess!!!!!! Required star rating but could not give ZERO rating! Do not buy..
cannot return.",0
I like the Jack Black product much better.,0
This soap is fantastic! The scent is absolutely amazing. I do recommend applying some lotion after you shower as this can leave your skin feeling a bit dry.,1
"Aweful product, very thick texture, clogs pores and it looks like a mask on a face. I wish I can return it and get my money back.",0
Don't use this if you have normal hair . Mine got burnt and fell off.,0
This product simply does not work as advertised.,0
Works well when using a flat iron but I certainly don't think it makes your hair shinier.,0
Worked for a year and then bit the dust. My 5 year old revlon from target works better,0
feel that this item is a watered down version of the product. I usually bought it from my hair cutter. It was always thick. The product I received from my online purchase was horrible and I would never buy it again.,0
"I really wanted to like this product, but I ended up throwing it away.  The lotion never fully absorbed into my skin and it left a white glow on my skin.  I am still searching for the perfect spf 30 daily moisturizer and this product just did not do the trick. I have fair skin and thought the ivory tint would be perfect, but perhaps I should have selected a darker tint. I will be trying a different product.",0
"I love this straightener! I have owned several chi's and then I bought the babyliss. I couldn't believe how well it worked! My hair is super curly and coarse and the chi never made my hair silky like the babyliss. With the chi my hair looked damaged. After I accidentally left my babyliss behind on vacation, I tried a croc, which was good, better than the chi, but not nearly as good as the babyliss. I finally have another babyliss pro nano and I love it even more! It takes no time at all to straighten my hair or curl it! It also makes it silky and shiny! I will never go back to another flat iron!",1
"I know the secret to using this. The tube it's dispensed from is a bad design, the plastic is way too thick to easily squeeze the primer from the tube. You can't just toss this into your make-up bag, it needs to sit with the cap (silver part) on standing on end. I have to leave it in my medicine cabinet so it stays upright. It's not so easy to get out but that's the only way it works for me.

Once out of the tube, I love this primer. It's thin, just takes a little to cover my face. Gives a slight glow and hides any redness I may have. I rarely use foundation, but my Physicians Formula bronzer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Physicians-Formula-Murumuru-Butter-Bronzer-Light-0-38-Ounce/dp/B018B8Q66O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Physicians Formula Murumuru Butter Bronzer, Light, 0.38 Ounce</a>&nbsp;looks wonderful applied over this primer and stays on almost all day.

Good physical, not chemical, sunscreen. I'd really like SPF 30 instead, but sometimes when the SPF is amp-ed up, it makes the lotion sticky. This isn't sticky, but it does have a slight sunscreen scent, but I have to press my nose right against my skin to smell it.

Bliss needs to re-think the container design. I'd give this primer 5 stars if I didn't have to fight the tube it comes in.",1
"Goes on smoothly no clumps. Within 8hrs of working indoors there are black ""?tubes"" on my face below my eyes. Worse than smudges. Tried numerous times kept happening. Huge waste of money.",0
Great new scent! Seems to be going over really well!,1
I have baby fine hair and this works great after shampooing to comb out.,1
This curling tools is so big I had to give it away . You have to have super long hair for this size,0
"It made my mail polish last a few days longer without chipping, but mostly what it did was make it really difficult to get nail polish off and make the top layer of my fingernails crack and peel. I was disappointed because I have a friend who raves about this stuff. I guess it's not for everyone.",0
It has been one product that I have had no reaction with my rosacea. It's a bit costly that's why I didn't give it five stars but if it works then it's worth it!,1
First one I received came completely in pieces but I sent it back and got a new one very easily and very fast. The new one works great!,1
I love this product.  I have used it for a long time and it not only works great but it smells really good too!,1
The tint is too dark.,0
prefer unscented products.  This one has a perfume that lingers,0
I didn't get the life-changing shave from this that everybody talked about; I didn't even get a particularly close shave.,0
I LOVE THIS BRONZER.  I have fair skin and this is great for Contouring and Highlighting.  Appreciate the referral for this product on http://www.maskcara.com/,1
First and foremost this cream burns my whole eye area and is no age control crme....didn't send it back because it took 4 weeks to arrive and came from Israel.  Amazon should not support this product.,0
"Goes on like a Crayola crayon - not super smooth, a bit cakey.
Indian folks - the ""natural"" color is not for you - you will look like a Twilight vampire extra.
I wish this brand would upload swatches of colors other than ""Ivory"" and ""Natural"".
I don't think this is a good brand for the Indian (or any melatonin rich) skin tone. The undertones of this color will make you look ill or ridiculous.
For some reason (I'm 37, so this may be why..) this concealer highlights the imperfections in my skin (the wrinkles,..).
If you sweat a lot, this concealer will move on you. If you try to put a powder on top to set it, it will cause creases and make you look old.
There are better brands than this at this price point, honestly even Boots and Maybelline are better.
Two stars.

Update: This product causes irritation to my skin. One star.",0
Love this compact eyelash curler!,1
"Omg this stuff instantly helped my hair. My hair was so fragile and brittle from bleaching and the first time I used it, I can totally see a difference. This stuff works.",1
"I've tried so many lotions for my nasty feet but nothing worked and I end up with a cabinet full of "" sure things"". I had heard about this crabtree and evellyn and, although it was pricey, I decided to give it a go. Well it came in a nice big bottle and plastic feet for those times when you want to condition all night...it worked so much better than any others. I have been using it
For 10 days and my cracks are gone, my 1 callus fell off and I'm still working on my feet sooner I still use it. Smells so good! Give it a try, I think you will enjoy the difference
to big difference

a little pricy but worth it.  Great clean feeling.l,1
"I got this for my mom for Christmas. It looks/works FANTASTIC, until you touch it. AND I even bought the hair spray to go over it. I simply touched her scalp lightly with my finger and it left a scalp-colored finger print. It immediately turns into a paint like consistency when it mixes with any natural hair/scalp oils. It gets cakey and clumpy as well. On the hair strands themselves it looks great, but its pointless if you want to cover bald spots.",0
"Does not fit the Babyliss pro hairdryer it claims it's for, not worth even shipping it back",0
"I did not care for this product. My hair did not hold a curl at all and I have long hair that always holds a curl. I feel like this is not a great curling iron for people with very fine hair. I would advise sticking to 1.25"" curling irons for fine hair.",0
beautiful color. OPI has the best and longest-lasting nail polishes,1
"I spent a lot of money on this device, and bought several extra brush heads. And it DIED after 14 months of normal use. VERY displeased!",0
"Two weeks! I've literally been using this for two weeks and my lashes already are noticeably longer and fuller! I generally use this twice a day; in the morning, I put this on first then my mascara. My eyelashes are long and clump-less all day! Before going to sleep, I put this on once I have removed my make up and cleansed, etc. I swear my eyelashes grow overnight. I love this stuff!",1
"Very thin liquid and a lot of it comes out at once. Made my skin feel extremely dry and tight - actually would hurt to smile because my skin was so dry.  I also use retin-a and had read online that this cleanser would still be okay to use, but I found it extremely harsh for me.  Also, it's not really a gel. It's a very cery runny gel almost like a liquid. A lot comes out at once and you actually need a lot for a lather. I also bought LRP's pigmentclar cleanser and you literally only need a quarter of a pea sized dollop in order to clean your entire face. It's amazing!",0
It didn't live up to the reviews I read prior to buying it. I originally saw it advertised on a site recommending it especially for naturally curly hair that's fine. Better use of $ for fine curly hair = Sebastian Potion 9 and Ion Curl Solutions Conditioning Curl Whip.,0
"For the price, I was expecting bigger sized samples, so I was pretty disappointed when I saw how small they were (except for maybe 2-3 of them). If you are expecting decent sized samples, this isn't the sample box for you.",0
"I bought this to reduce product build-up, rather than after swimming. I never used it more than once per week, but every time I used it, it stripped my hair to the point of it being extremely dry and straw-like! I can see how it might work well for people who naturally produce more protective oil, but it was WAY too harsh for my hair.

My recommendation: This probably works well if you have a LOT of build-up or chlorine to replace, but is too harsh for most normal use.",0
"If I didn't use the product religiously, I broke out in pimples everywhere on my face.  No thanks!",0
"I saw this on Business Insider and is a great alternative to Gold Bond Body Powder . Works as described, but I think it didn't work once when I put it on and then rode my bicycle.",1
This product is so light in color and dries SO DRY that it looks like tinted white out on my lips. I do not believe this color would look good on any skin tone. Did not retain original packaging to return. Disappointed beyond belief!,0
"Not medium blonde at all. This is bright, platinum blonde. Does not match my hair at all and looks stupid. Seller will not exchange or return.",0
Great hairdryer.,1
"I have seen some reviewers got gift as well, so bit sad with the fact that I didn't get anything with the product. I feel fresh whenever I apply it but didn't notice any visible change on my face.",1
I love this product but i was just wondering why I get very itchy  legs after using it.  It totally relieves my muscle aches and pains but afterward my legs itch for about 30 minutes.  It never affects any other part of my body.  I wonder if the lactic acid escapes from leg portion of my body.  it is the only thing that I can think of that would produce this.  Does anyone else have this reaction?,1
It's perfect. It is highly recommended.,1
"really fast, and good product!!!!!............came in the box sealed. like i was espected. really good price. I will buy another one",1
This seems to leave build-up on my hair. I recommend a more synthetic serum over an oil treatment.,0
"I cannot review this polish as I will never open it. I wanted a bright tangerine orange for fall. This polish is the color of a shiny new copper penny. Not orange...  No red.  This cannot be returned so I am out $15 for nothing. My manicurist nor her clients would take it due to the ugly color.  I have brand new Apple devices that display colors accurately so I chose this color expecting what I viewed online. Big mistake.  I am ""awarding"" this product one star as I cannot post ""no stars"".",0
My sons fave!!,1
This does not help in volumizing your hair at all. I was so disappointed. I would recommend gettinga  spray rather than a powder which has a dry shampoo consistency.,0
You really must learn how to use this before purchasing.,0
Worked less than 2 years and suddenly just stopped in the middle of use. I won't be wasting anymore money buying another.,0
"We first saw this at a Vince Camuto store in Maryland. Nice to know that this can be ordered on Amazon.com. A strong fragrance. As perfume preferences are so personal, it might be better to try this in the mall first.",1
Pedi File?  Seriously?,0
I have been using this product for years and I'm never disappointed. You don't need much to do the job. Makes blow drying so much easier.,1
"This smells amazing. I can't say if it has helped with acne or anything like that, but my face does feel more moisturized after I use it. It has such a nice texture and I've been using it every night but it seems like I haven't even used 1/4 of the bottle yet because you have to use the smallest amount.",1
"I tried to use this after showering off the foam as an extra boost of colour and to lengthen the tan. It claimed it would make the tan last 3 days longer. Instead, it made my tan patchy and only last TWO DAYS. Not two extra days. TWO DAYS after applying this product.

Furthermore, when I applied it, it kept leaving these weird brown bally-crumb looking things...

I would NOT recommend if the way I used is how you were intending to use it.",0
Product had different texture than product bought in the store. Writing on product was not english.,0
"I had an Elchim years ago and loved it. After five years it broke, I needed something quick so I bought a Babyliss at a local store. It was awful. Took too long to dry my hair, the handle got so hot every time I used it, I finally decided to go back to an Elchim. I was so excited to get it, it was a breeze to dry my thick hair, until the heating element broke after about two dozen uses. So disappointed. I really loved my old Elchim, but the heating element seems to be a known issue now. Too bad. Now I am left looking for a new brand to try..........",0
Ive used the real stuff. This stings and is astrongent,0
This made my hair feel oily which is what I was trying to avoid.,0
"I had high expectations for this and when my favorite Youtuber described it, it sounded heavenly, however, upon first opening it, it had the stench of mothballs mixed with old socks. Won't purchase again.",0
"I have used the Somme Institute line for some time now. When used consistently, there is a visible difference in skin health and glow. When I haven't been using it I can tell the difference. I used the entire 5 product line. May be a little expensive, but most of the products last a long time.",1
This product did absolutely nothing for me. I drink 2 cups of coffee everyday and followed the instructions and saw no improvement with my stain.,0
"Not as advertised do not blend into hair,
Looks powdery",0
"This color is so much more lighter than the bottle, and what is written on CND's website!  I love the concept, but the color is for a small child, not an adult!",0
"Best face sunblock ever! Been using this for years ! The tint is very light so it won't change the color of your skin but helped so that you won't be white looking from the sunblock , great for men and woman . Doesn't look like makeup at all so don't worry about that .non greasy and won't make you break out",1
Item was as described.,1
"Gentle, smells and feels great.  I am a believer in rotating out shampoo and conditioner and this conditioner is definitely in my permanent rotation.",1
"The curls last a lot longer then my curling iron, the only draw back is that you can get your hair tangled in the teeth of the comb.",1
"Does nothing, too heavy, didn't like it, not for my skin type, who knows, No, i don't recommend this cream. I rather leave it alone after the use of pixie laser pen.",0
"OPI does not approve of Amazon selling this product. My pumps don't work, no smell and on hold for 1 hour to get my money back!!! Do NOT BUY OFF AMAZON!!!!",0
great stuff the best - like the smell,1
It has not worked for me as others have stated or as the product stated it would. Sometimes a visit to the dermatologist is the best bet.,0
Best cream ever!,1
"I would never ever, ever recommend this spray (If I could I would give it negative stars).  I have a medical condition that makes me lose my hair even though I am not even 30.  I tried the Toppik hair building fibers in a travel size and absolutely loved it.  I swear by it, in fact.  My hair has never looked so good since I was diagnosed.  So, when I went to go buy more Toppik, I thought hmmm this looks interesting I think I will try this, maybe it is a bit easier and I will like it more.  WRONG! I went to use it and it is more like spray painting your head then actually getting a nice look to your hair.  It didn't match my color, even though the hair building fibers in this color do.  It stained a new top that I had just bought the day before.  It makes your hair feel like you have just spray painted it, worse than a hairspray feel.  Every time I went to scratch my head or move my bangs I got this horrible paint on my hands, and because it was raining today when I got to work, everyone noticed that something brown was dripping down my neck.  And to put the cherry on the top, when I got home to take a shower, I was washing my hair to get this horrible product out and it stained the floor of my shower and the towel that I was using to dry off.

I beg of you to not buy this product, please instead go look for Toppik's hair building fibers.  That is the best product for thinning or balding hair that I have found, and trust me I have looked all over.  I just wish that I would not have wasted my money on this product, my time, and the items that are now stained.",0
"This was suppose to show a noticeable lightening of pigment in 6 weeks. I've used it on very light to medium tan spots on my face, twice a day, and see no difference at all. IMHO, this is a rip-off and definitely not worth the price.",0
This bottle feels super diluted. The bath soap used to be more concentrated.... Hopefully shampoo was not diluted prior to sale. Gonna buy a bottle from nordie to compare the concentration. Will update at a later time with finding.,0
"Nope. Didn't help my acne. I'm 28 and I break out frequently and I've always read good reviews about this stuff online, but it didn't help me. And it smells like sulfur. Disappointed.

"essie is by far my favorite nail polish! I needed a good green color. While yes, I do like this color, it is not as thick as I would like.",1
"I bought this hair dryer to use at home. I travel Mon-Thursday and take a different travel size dryer with me on the road. I used this dryer a total of about 30 times when it started to sound like there were marbles in the motor and then smoke and a wierd smell came from it. It was past the time to be able to return it so I contacted T3 to let them know what happened. They offered to sell me an extended warranty for $65,pay shipping and handling both ways it would turn out I be spending another $120 to ""replace"" the $100 dryer I used 3 times. The travel dryer I have had which i bought from Walgreens for $29 has been working like a charm for 3 years now. This product is not worth the expense. I expect a $100 dryer to last longer than 30 uses.",0
"EXCELLENT SHAMPOO, AND A LITTLE DAB'LL DO YA...",1
"Fortunately I bought mine at a store that takes returns regardless of the time purchased.  I returned mine after using it for about a year.  I saw no improvement despite using it regularly.  It's an expensive gadget that takes time and effort which I willingly put in thinking it would work.  Not so.  I saw no difference in my skin, sorry to say.",0
"Wasn't very happy with application ,didn't apply as smooth as it should.",0
"I originally purchased this set after doing a ton of research on 3-step acne systems for adults, including proactiv, acnefree, and others. This one seemed to have good overall reviews, so I decided to give it a try. The gel cleanser is probably my favorite from the set. It cleans well, has a nice lather (which I strongly prefer to lather-free cleansers) and my skin is not overly dry afterwards. The Step 2 toner, Effaclar Clarifying Solution, is also very effective. I use it once per day before going to sleep, and again, nice effect to the product, no over-drying, and my skin (for lack of a better description), simply feels healthy after using it. Ever since I was a teenager, my skin seems to react well to Glycolic Acid based products, and this is no exception.  Step 3, Effaclar Duo was the part my skin has issues with. My skin has traditionally been sensitive to benzoyl peroxide products, and sadly I found the same result here. It should be noted that my skin seems absolutely fine if i use it ONLY for very occasional spot treatment, but if I apply on a daily basis, it absolutely makes my outbreaks worse, and gives my skin an oily feel and appearance. If I had to take an amateur guess, perhaps the LHA included does help with exfoliating those tougher pimples, but again, benzoyl is simply not for me.

So to recap, I've found that if I stick to using the first 2 of the 3 steps, and then only occasionally apply a tiny bit of the Step 3 Duo cream to my worst pimples, everything seems to be in balance. This is the only reason I give 4 of 5 stars - if you personally do not have negative reactions to benzoyl peroxide, it very well may be a 5 star system for you. It has to be noted that caution should be used when applying these products in the summertime, but that's true of most acne products out there. Find a nice oil-free sunscreen to use, and you should be fine.

As I write this review, I've been using the system for about 6 months, and although my acne isn't completely gone, overall I have to say that the system has been one of the most effective skin care products on the market for me. Of course, as they say, ""your mileage may vary""!  ;-)",1
I loved paul mitchel until i saw the toxic rating for this. Totally freaked me out. I highly recommend everyone scan in products on the ewg app and learn about what you are putting onto and into your body. This is highly toxic but cruelty free. It was a great purple shampoo option for me before i knew how poisonous it was.,0
The box I received DID NOT have many items in the picture. It comes with a few men samples (which is weird cause isn't that what the men box is for?). Also the samples you get aren't exactly luxury as they are cheap drug store brands.,0
"It is nice, howver i am experiencing pimples on my face post using this; maybe it is my skin reacting.",1
"I've been using Rusk Moist shampoo for years - this was the first time from this particular vendor (NewvoBeauty) on Amazon.
Rusk is normally pink in color and fragrant. This was noticeably darker and smelled a bit 'funky'.
Also - this was the old style bottle (cylindrical as shown in the picture) the newer bottles are tapered like a Coke bottle.
So I think I was sold old, outdated stock.
When I checked the Amazon return policy, it expired yesterday (July2) - and would have only been for a partial refund.
Oh, well. - one of the few times I've been burnt by Amazon - but more so by the vendor.
Last time I'll order anything from NewvoBeauty - that was the vendor.",0
Good,1
"I have very fine here which isn't very long. And I find using conditioners in the shower often promotes greasiness and doesn't do an effective job maintaining my hair and keeping away static electricity.

However, most leaving conditioners are either so watery they are not helpful at all or are so heavy they produce extremely unattractive results.  This conditioner what was surprising because it helped to tangle my hair, keeps it from freezing and responding negatively to humidity, kept static electricity under control, and was late enough that my hair was not weighed down.

Some reviewers commented about sent. I honestly don't know this is sent one way or another. For me, this is good. If I want to use a scent, I don't want to coming from my haircare products.",1
works for a while,1
"I like the product,  but it wasn't the color I expected.  The color wasn't marked & the item was open.",0
"Great product, but not the miracle it is said to be. There is no magic bullet for over-processed hair, but this is a good conditioner.",1
Does not heat quick...,0
Pleased with my order.  Product was as described and delivered in timely manner -- packaged well.,1
Don't like the colored as well as the plain but the same great scent is there and makes skin feel wonderful.,1
Definitely One of the best blades that I've ever used.,1
One of the better tightened on the market,1
"A friend and I saw this polish on Pinterest but couldn't find it anywhere.  We were so happy to see it on Amazon.  It is an awesome neutral color for any time during the year, as well as any occasion.  You can top with a touch of sparkle for a fancier event!",1
It's good.,1
"Really like this brush, works great on many types of hair. DO NOT attempt to use it in any country with different current. Even through a transformer, it blew out this brush and I have to buy a new one.",1
"I was really excited to try this curl wand since my hair never holds curl unless I use some type of ""wand"". However, as soon as I opened this package I had a bad feeling about it. There was clear packing tape over the ends of the hot tools box. Which in my past experience, generally means it was once a returned item and I'm getting second pick at it!  As soon as a plugged it in there was a fine steady stream of smoke coming from the lower portion of it. There wasn't plastic or anything touching it so I'm not sure why it was happening. I gave it a few minutes and it continued on and off....Needless to say, it's unplugged and going back to Amazon. I did try it on a couple pieces of hair though and really liked the look. So hopefully I can have it replaced with a more reliable one.",0
Smells like petroleum,0
Too little for the cost.,0
Anyone looking for a good shade of pink nail polish should get this color. OPI never disappoints me. Their products are amazing.,1
Too much alcohol in this product. Dries out skin.,0
"I never write reviews, but I had to in this case. I love thus product, but DO NOT buy from this vendor. After reading a number of reviews my thoughts were confirmed. I received this product and there was absolutely no color left in it. It appears a number of other people have received product that was partially used or empty as well.",0
"I was really looking forward to using this toothpaste, especially after reading such positive reviews about it.  I love mint, and I love the scent of jasmine, but had never really discovered them used together in any fashion.  Maybe it's me, or maybe not, but the initial smell that comes to my mind every time I use this toothpaste, is...now this is gross, but it smells like minty dog poop to me.  I've never smelled jasmine that smells this way, and I know that mint wouldn't, so I don't know what's in this toothpaste that makes me think of that.  To be fair, though, it is only the scent I'm turned off by.  It does make my mouth tingle afterwards, and my teeth feel really clean and the initial gross scent does subside from my olfactory senses. Maybe I'll try another flavor, but without any floral flavors added.",0
has a very odd smell. Does not seem to last as a deodorant and needs to be reapplied,0
"Smells amazing I love this part if my routine.
I had never faithfully used a toner before. I love what it does for my skin make a big difference!",1
does the job well,1
"Product is good, came when they said it was comming.",1
"A good pencil that makes a nice fine line that can easily be 'smudged' for a smokey look. Stays on a full 24 hours but is not completely waterproof. Having said that, I would buy it again.",1
Didn't do what I needed at all.,0
"This is a cheap, all-plastic brush with stiff bristles.  My understanding is that this particular style of brush should have feather-soft bristles.  Well, these are plastic bristles and stiff. The wand is somewhat flexible plastic, wrapped around with plastic, and at some places the plastic wrap stuck out and was sharp - I had to cut off ends.

I think this is a cheap piece of junk. Made in China. If you want a good brush you will have to pay for it, and be sure to test it first at a cosmetics counter where fine makeup products are sold. Then you'll get a good brush that will last years and years.  Don't waste your money.

Finally, the fan has a large spread. If I used it for blush it would put blush on the whole side of my face. Very hard to do anything put put on powder all over the face with this.",0
"This does add a small amount of very real looking volume. It's easy to apply and blends in easily and quickly, however it does give your hair kind of a funky texture. I'm sure this is what makes it work, but it's more on the dry chalky feeling side. Smells good too!",1
"They have a great thing going with this cleansing cream, you have to use twice or three times what they suggest.  It does not lather at all.  I will not buy it again.",0
"Terrible, did not wok at all. It's messy and makes one look as if one has powder in one's hair.  Don't waste your money!",0
"My daughter loves this, and her friends now wear it...thanks Laura!",1
"I first tried this product because my hairstylist put it on my hair.  I have really curly hair that I normal straighten chi-style.  She talked me into letting it go curly, and put this on my hair.  No frizz, no crazy hair.  Just really nice, normal, settled down, beautiful curls!  Finally I like my hair!  The funny thing about this is that the product is supposed to be used when flat ironing your hair, which I don't do.  It works better than any gel or anti-frizz stuff I have ever tried, and believe me, I have spent a fortune on the stuff.  Try it, you'll like it!",1
"When purchasing the flat iron, it did not indicate that is was for a different wall plug. I was extremely disappointed, so I sent it back.",0
The best!,1
"We LOVE this stuff. It smells great, rubs in so quickly and sand isn't all over us after we apply it. I have a son with ASD and choosin the right sun screen is very important. It has to feel right, not be sticky, not smell bad, rub in fast, etc. this fits the bill. It's worth the cost and I didn't burn all summer even though I am the color of paper.",1
Worked great for 6 months but now has an electrical short and doesn't work. Can't I get a new one sent out?,0
Love it,1
"I brought this after using a milder lotion from a different company with lower concentration of glycolic acid. I tolerated that lotion well with amazing results, so thought of increasing the acid content. I had very high hopes for this one. All glycolic acid products burn  and that is expected. This one burns too but it's not the burning which makes it totally intolerable it's the stickiness. The base on this lotion is so sticky, like applying grease to the body. No way I could use it on my entire body. But I kept it thinking I will use it on legs ,..... But guys please, I have tried so many times to somehow use it ... But it's just not possible. I often put it and after few minutes take a shower agin to wash it off. It is just disgustingly sticky. Very bad product. I wish I can find another 17% glycolic product in a thinner lotion.",0
Does wonders for curly hair. Use sparingly to avoid looking greasy.,1
good stuff does the job better then most!,1
I had a hard time opening this and when I finally did the top of the cream pencil got stuck to the inside of the cap and completely got pulled free of the main tube. I managed to stuff it back in and got my hands covered in color for my troubles. Really bad packaging. At least the color seems nice.,0
Great product!  Smells great and does the trick.  I've tried others but they dry my hair out too much.  This one is just right.,1
Wasn't what I thought I was getting,0
Does not work as well on break-outs as thought.,0
Would not recommend.  Did not like.  Still haven't used.  Disappointed.  Doesn't really get hot.,0
"I bought this in the Patina color. The color is very vivid, but it did not stay all day and it dried my lips out. It stayed on for about 2 hours and when I looked in the mirror, all that was left was lipstick lines around the borders of my lips. The lipstick left stains on the straw I was drinking from. The drying sensation was unpleasant and any lip moisturizer just takes the color off. The COVERGIRL Outlast Lip Color that I've been using lasts longer, even through eating and drinking, and comes with a moisturizer. I thought something more high end would be better, but I'll stick with the drugstore brand.",0
I wanted to love this product based on the reviews. It irritated my eyes. I used it two or three times and my eyes were itchy and felt like they had been scratched.,0
Love love love this perfume i put it on on the morning and it lasts all day. Good size bottle too.,1
"This was a really fun sample beauty box. I'm glad that I found out about it before it was too late to receive one for myself. I loved that a few items for men were included. I've been dying to try those wh this was a really fun sample beauty box. I'm glad that I found out about it before it was too late to receive one for myself. I loved that a few items for men were included. I've been dying to try WEN cleansing conditioner and the sample provided is more than adequate to give you a good idea of what this product will do for you. I went on a vacation and I used pretty much every single in the box. I would definitely buy this box again.
The box itself is quite adorable and I am reusing it",1
"I hate writing negative reviews especially on a product of a company I believe in...HOWEVER...I thought this product was going to be my foundational Holy Grail.  After re-reading several times the claims of what it is supposed to do and re-applying exactly as instructed, I saw absolutely no visible difference.  Granted, my pore-problem is arrogantly non-severe and maybe I expected soap opera star skin but this did absolutely nothing for me--but the fragrance? did!  It made me nauseous.  Sorry to rant but to me it smells something like a mix between coppertone sunscreen and cheap deodorant.  I rant yet again:  the packaging:  Pretty lavender metal cannister top but if it pulls away from the actual ribbed plastic liner---forgetaboutit...anyone who's pull the handle off of a nail polish applicator brush will completely relate.  And finally...god forbid your dispenser valve clogs up--prepare to play dodge the spray when it sometimes decides to spurt.  My personal best was a good three feet on the wall behind my vanity.  I really really wanted to like this product but...not for me.  Try it if you must, but I'll stick to Laura Mercier primer.",0
I love these curling irons. They last a really long time. Shipping was fast as well.,1
"I initially bought this product because Panoxyl was on back order, and i couldn't be happier with my purchase! At first I was afraid that it wouldnt work, but it has proven to work just as well if not better than Panoxyl! My skin has cleared up to the point that I no longer wear foundation (which is a big deal, for me). Panoxyl is no longer on back order, but I will happily stay with Derma Topix. It not only cleared up my acne, but it also keeps my face from getting oily! Great product and a GREAT price!",1
"Im a big La Roche Posey fan, but sadly this product just doesnt make it. Its not waterproof at all and starts smudging all around my eyes in 2 hours! I have high hopes for La Roche Poseys cosmetic line and hopefully this can be communicated to their lab",0
"This is gold! It's fragrant, creamy and deeply moisturizing. I just love it.",1
My favorite gluten free tanner! Does not streak and looks natural. Friends have asked where I went tanning! :),1
"I don't understand the good reviews here. I owned a Hot Tools titanium curling iron that just went bust on me and thought what can go wrong with getting the same brand. Well...there is a big difference in how this handles compared to the previous one. The clamp handle is high and difficult to push down with one finger as the spring is tough, which leads to jerky hand movements when trying to run this through strands to create a curl. In spite of the strong spring, when you reach the end of your strand one of two things happen: the hair just slides out of clamp and you have to start the curl all over again; or, the hair just snags at the base of the clamp in the spring and you just have to tug and unravel the curl to set it loose and start again.
I got extremely frustrated trying to curl my hair several times and just did not get a good smooth experience. It is heavier than my previous curling iron and more cumbersome to operate. If you are looking for a basic curling iron and don't mind getting clamp creases and having hand cramps from trying to open and close that clamp, only to have your strands sliding out as your trying to get the curl set....then get this one. I will return it and look for another one.",0
I like this product- It is easy to use and gives a nice color. Personally it worked better on my arms then on my legs. Only con is it fades quickly.,1
This one is super gentle. I would suggest more for sensitive skin. the bristles are very soft.,1
"I recently ordered the roller, and one out of four rollers had burn out when I tested.  I received my replacement (new pkg of four) few days ago.  However, two of them still burn out.  The remaining rollers are working fine.
Bottom line, the QA check on this product is very poor and need to be improved.",0
Like the way it feels on nails,1
"This product has been getting a lot of attention on beauty blogs and in magazines as great makeup remover, but I don't agree. I bought into the hype and have to say that the Bioderma Crealine H2O is no better than any other drugstore makeup remover I've ever used. I don't wear a lot of eye makeup- just mascara and small sweep of powdered eye shadow for liner- and even so, I have to rub and rub my eyes with this stuff on a cotton ball in order to remove the makeup completely. The worst part is that it caused break outs under my eyes nearly every time I've used it, so in the trash it goes. Bummer.",0
"I love this product!  I won't ever use a ""regular"" polish remover again.  This takes off the polish in literally 2-3 swipes.",1
"JI's products are cruelty-free and this is the main reason I've bought them, though to be quite frank, in this case, I feel that the primer does little to nothing to make makeup last longer. I will not purchase it again.",0
all ill use,1
"Very disappointed. These patches are not really like a gel or soother, they are kind of tough, and hurt when you take them off. The name says Hydro cool Gels, they are not hydrating or cooling, I do not recommend.  Sorry...",0
"The brush is nice but the size is not. It shouldn't be sold as medium sized brush. It is not my idea of medium, more like small to extra small, especially if you have long hair. It is very difficult to tell looking at that picture. Very disappointed.",0
They actually sent me hot curlers instead when I ordered this curling iron expecting to get it. i was a little dissapointed when i recieved the curlers but don't want to go the the hassel of shipping it back and i will just keep my wrong item...,0
"I would not buy this item again because the set does not heat up hot enough even if you preheat for an hour.  Also, the clips cause dents in your hair if you are lucky enough to have them not fall out.",0
This is wonderful product!,1
"Love this product. Fast delivery, and item exactly as decribed!",1
I purchased this new in September and it quit heating within 4 months. That's ridiculous. I'm back to using my 13 year old CHI straightener.,0
"Bought at Macys, worked great for two years, then the non-replaceable battery dies and you have to through it away as if it weren't a $200 appliance to clean your face.",0
Lighter than I thought and coverage was not very thick. Still a good product if you don't want a lot of coverage. It is just the replacement and not in a compact.,1
Wonderful product. I have very thin hair and when my hairdresser put this on my hair it looks like I have think hair.,0
Not the same shampoo as sold in salons.  different texture and smell.  I will think twice before I purchase online again.,0
I USE THIS STUFF MOST DAYS AND I LIKE HOW IT PROTECTS MY HAIR FROM HEAT AS WELL AS SEALS & SOFTENS. I DO USE SPARINGLY BECAUSE I HAVE FINE HAIR AND DON'T WANT TO WEIGH IT DOWN.,1
I was hoping that it would also help enhance curls but it really just controls frizz pretty well,1
"I have used this product before but the towlettes were larger.  These were too small and dried out too quickly.  These are ok for small areas of the body but definitely not for the entire body.

"great product.  have used it on and off for years.  anything from acne to any other type of skin issue, bumps, abrasions.  no skin issue-use it to hydrate facial skin.",1
"I've been looking for a dark glitter polish, I love Butter London, and this price is great so I went and got Gobsmacked. I love it!",1
"I have very fair skin with red tones (which I hate and am working on).  I first thought this would like like a mud mask -- it's really dark.  But, to my delight it really blends into your skin and is a great primer.  It absorbs quickly.  I didn't even notice the smell others noticed. Not sure about the benefits as I've only been using it a few days -- so far so good.",1
"Not the correct product in tube. Didn't smell or feel like what it should. I still had some in my original bottle which is white, smooth, creamy and smells like mint. Wherever you acquired these from, you got scammed as did I.",0
Good pencil - does not irritate,1
"This flat iron burned my hair to a crisp right after a trim. My hair dresser said it's happened to several other clients as well. I have the green one, works great. This one is HORRIBLE! I can't wait until my hair grows out!",0
"I've read much hype about this line and thought I'd try it.  The product performs the same as other less expensive lip moisturizers.  If the price was a third of what I paid for the first tube, I'd consider using it all the time.  But it's not so I will stick to the less expensive products and have the same results.",0
"In my case, this product did NOT control oil, did NOT have ANY effect on my pimples and did NOT prevent new pimples from forming, despite my using it twice a day for about two or three weeks (in the AM and just before bed). I used it after the DDF blemish foaming wash and, in the mornings, before DDF's SPF45 oil-free moisturizer. Obviously, this product worked for some people, because they rave about it here, but it did not work for me at all. I recommend trying a sample before you spend money on this. It's too expensive, in my opinion, for regular (non-wealthy) folks to buy it only to have to throw it away because it isn't doing anything besides taking up space.

I'm a 33-year-old woman. My acne never completely went away, to my disappointment, but lately it was steadily getting worse. I tried several products--including a 2% salicylic acid formula from L'Oreal that came with a soft scrubbing pad and Burt's Bee's 1.5% salicylic acid acne wash and salicylic acid facial moisturizer. None of those things helped. Then I remembered using DDF before and thinking it had helped, so I decided to try it again. There was NO discernible change. In fact, I continued to get new pimples, including whiteheads and cysts. Finally, my mother bought me five items from The Body Shop's tea tree line, which incorporates tea tree oil, obviously. I have been using the tea tree products for about a week now and my skin is softer and getting clearer (cysts drying out). Plus, no new pimples have formed at all. All I can say is this: whenever possible, get samples. Don't believe the hype!",0
I specifically purchased this product for that cotton candy smell most of these reviews were raving about. I wash my hair every other day & wanted to use this on the days I don't suds up my strands. Once my package came I sprayed this onto my hair. The smell was more perfumey than it is of sugar or cotton candy. I have somewhat of a sensitive nose & this product made it hurt. I tried it three times to give the perfume a chance & maybe to see if i'd get used to the smell. I never did & the scent doesn't last very long. I'd say three hours max! I wanted to like this product. I am disappointed.,0
"I love this sunscreen, I look forward to putting it on. I have very sensitive, dry, irritated skin and this calms it down. I also love that it's mineral sunscreen and paraben and fragrance free. I will be a loyal user for life.",1
Cgjmch,1
This gives my skin a glow. I love it.,1
This seemed to me to be nothing more than overpriced Stridex wipes as it has the same smell and feeling on the skin of a Stridex wipe. I used the whole container but saw absolutely no change. I love Jack Black products and will continue to use the face moisturizer and hand lotion but this is an absolute waste!,0
Color is much lighter than expected. Very Matte.,0
The color just makes me sleepy when I look at it on my nails. It isn't here nor there; a translucent wash of nothing and some sparkles.,0
"Expensive but it does a good job. The one thing that I like is that it does not have a scent to it or very light scent. Usually I like strong scented skin products but this one works lighter. My daughter and wife love it but the rest of us have also been using it too. Great when out in the sun and it is not real greasy either which some of these products are. Wife likes using it on her face when we are outside the boys like it on their hands-makes your skin feel soft and young again.

If the price was lower would be a staple in our house-will be watching for sales on Amazon.",1
This stuff is amazing when you need to clean your brushes in between a thorough washing. I use this daily for my eyeliner brush after Im done with it each morning so that the product doesnt dry on the brush. 1 squirt on some Kleenex and a little back and forth wipe and its good as new. This is my second bottle. I highly recommend.,1
Was very disappointed...lotion very thin & runny.  The smell is less than pleasant & item overpriced.  Will definitely not order again.,0
"Fragrant water?  Oh, please. This is just a run-of-the-mill perfume, and a cheap one at that. It's not light or relaxing, and even one spritz left me reeking of baby powder and aging flowers.  It brought on a headache within 10 minutes, and I'm not susceptible to that.  I wear perfume every day,  but expensive ones and this one does not measure up.  Honestly it reminds me most of my daughter's Axe body sprays, which I also hate.  But if you love Axe, maybe this is what you're looking for.",0
"It really moisture my hair everytime I use it! I have a lot of hair, I use a lot of it everytime, it's a small bottle... So it's a little expensive.. But worth it!",1
Have been buying this for about almost a year now and it lasts a long time and it works well. It isn't too heavy on my hair and it holds!,1
"I like the product, but it's just so difficult to find the right color online. Light tan was too light and tan was a bit dark.",1
really pretty color one coat is all you need. Learning to use it correctly is key,1
I absolutely love the color. looks like a rose gold on my lips.  I was a little disappointed in the size of the bottle and i'm sure i'll go through the product pretty quickly during the spring/summer.,1
Not the same. Salon on the left.  This is a clear product. Fake.,0
"I absolutely love this.  I have medium length hair, that normally takes a long time to dry.  It took 4 minutes with this.",1
"I don't really care for it.. It feels grainy. I don't mind the lemon scent, but it wasn't moisturizing and unfortunately held more pigment than I realized, so my lips end up looking brown with the 'Buff'.. should've gone with a pinkier tone. Will not be repurchasing.",0
"This was awful. Curls were cute at first but fell out within an hour making my hair look stupid and disheveled at work :( my hair holds curl really well (2-3 days usually). I thought maybe I didn't have the heat high enough ( I have thick, wavy hair). Turned it up and it smelled like the iron was burning my hair. Even with the higher setting the curls fell out qucikly. Just returned to Amazon.",0
Went to use it the first time this morning. I received it yesterday.  Sadly the pump came broken.,0
"1st time buying a  Safety Razor, but I'll tell you it's worth every penny expensive but you save a lot of money in the long run.",1
"V76 Vaughn Tex Texture Paste is kind of a mixed bag.  It works really well in providing texture but other than that it comes with some drawbacks.  As others have mentioned, it does have a strange smell that really lasts more in your hands than in your hair.  In addition, there isn't enough moisture in this product and the effect is twofold.  First, it doesn't spread well and you have to use a pretty sizable amount each application even with relatively short hair.  Second, it kind of dries my hair our over the course of the day.  I think I will use this for evenings out but not as part of a morning routine.",0
Kind of disappointed.  I first came across this lotion in Disney. My feet were beyond sore from walking and this lotion got me through.  I ran out and was excited to find it again. Its a much smaller package now and seems watered down? Im not sure what happened. The version a couple years ago was much better.  For the price its incredibly small and watery.,0
"We all know that OPI makes a superior product--excellent brush, proper consistency, and long wear.  This color is marvelous.  It does take a bit of nerve to wear it (a brilliant solid metal!), so I first used it on my toenails and could not stop looking down!  That extreme flash of metal peeking out of my high heeled sandals was ""just the thing"".  I felt amazing.  Now that the weather has turned in the Pacific Northwest and I need to switch to high heeled boots, I've tried this color on my hands, and while it's wild, it's also completely neutral, which doesn't take away the flash, but it does make it un-gaudy, if you know what I mean...

This is an amazing color and superb product.  An opaque metal in a lesser brand would show brush strokes, bubbles, and general flaws, but this OPI color goes on like car paint.  It couldn't be better!",1
"This is not to the same quality of other Elizabeth Arden products,  it goes on almost greasy, leaving a wet slippery feeling.  Either the company that sent it to me ruined the product somehow or the product is substandard.",0
I like these bath salts. But I have found other brands that I like better. These salts smell wonderful and I can soak for an hour. I have no complaints just like other brands better,1
This is literally my favorite mousse! Holds just the right amount while still leaving hair feeling touchable and flexible!,1
AWESOME,1
"Very disappointing. The ""sonic energy"" is quite low. This unit does not compare well with the Sonicare. The Sonicare seems to really have a high frequency, high energy brush action. The Issa unit is downright limp by comparison. I really did not feel like the sonic action was cleaning my teeth at all.",0
"Works great, far better than others I have tried, but pricey!",1
"It's very powerful, and I need that because I have really long, thick hair, and I swear the drying time was cut in HALF when I started using this. I love it. And the red/black colors are cool together.  Well-made!",1
Don't waste time or money.  Skip this and go straight to Taylor of Old Bond Street.,0
"I was very disappointed when I received this brush. I have owned two Mason Pearson brushes before, and I purchased both in the 'Dark Ruby.' I received this brush, and it was opaque black... not 'Dark Ruby' ... I compared it to my old brush. Also, when I looked online to see what features may indicate it may be fake... it didn't pass the tests... I am very suspicious this is not a genuine Mason Pearson brush. Very dissatisfied and will be returning the brush.",0
"I purchased this system as a Christmas gift.  If it's as good as my Clarisonic cleaner, I trust this was a great investment towards cleaner, wonderful feeling, and excellent exfoliation of facial skin care for men.",1

"OPI Nail Envy Nail Strengthener peels to easily. The directions states to apply daily, however it begins to chip in less than 24 hours. In addition, I've noticed very little difference in the improvement on my nails.",0
"I usually love Mustela but this product smells way too strong for sensitive baby skin.  I was looking for something more mild and natural for my 7 month old's sensitive and dry eczema prone skin.  The smell of this wash (while pleasant) is very strong and anything with this much perfume cannot be good for baby.  It smells like something a woman's department store brand would make. I am shocked this is a Mustela product.  More importantly, it has not improved baby's skin and I think it's actually made it worse.",0
"I read all the reviews and was a bit concerned about breakouts, but so far I guess I've been lucky.  I've been blessed with ""good"" skin but have begun noticing some deeper lines around my mouth and between my eyebrows so that's where I'm focusing right now.  I do think I see some slight improvement which makes me very happy. I'm not looking for miracles, just improvement.  Yes, it's pricey but no prescription needed, and the tube should last me quite a while.

I wish it was fragrance free because I'm quite sensitive to smells, but thankfully the scent dissipates after a short while.  It definitely appears to be the actual product and not fake as some reviewers have mentioned.  Honestly, I don't know how the tube could be emptied and refilled anyway.  Yes, there are quite a few chemicals in this, and I am careful not to overload my skin with artificial ingredients, but I'll continue to use this if I see results.

UPDATE  03/04/17:
Well, I cannot use this.  After applying nightly for probably two weeks (per directions), suddenly I broke out in burning, red, dry skin where I applied it between my eyebrows.  Researched retinol and discovered mostly recommended to apply every few days to build up for sensitive skin.  Redness has not subsided after 4 days.  And because it makes the skin hyper-sensitive to sunlight, this will definitely not be staying in my house.",0
"Davines Oi Milk is heavenly.  I have never experienced any product that made my hair feel so soft.  The scent is wonderful, not overpowering, and is very natural smelling.  I spray twice on my hands and work into wet hair.  After blowdrying, I use one for spray into my hands and work into dry hair.  My hair is very fine and it gives it some body and control without any stickiness or greasiness that comes from other styling products.  It leaves my hair smelling fresh and lovely.",1
"I bought this to match a manicure in the same color. Unfortunately, this is not the same color. It claims it's ""Mod About You"", but it's more of a neon/Barbie pink instead of the pretty neutral pink it should be. Too bad it can't be returned as it's not the correct color.",0
Great product great price. Exactly what I was looking for!,1

"This is a nice alternative to moose or gel for my long hair.  It is not sticky at all, but puts a little product in my thin hair.",1
Don't even think of buying it since it's fake. You can tell as soon as you open the box and be sure when you compare it with a real one because I got one from Nordstrom 4 month back.,0
Very difficult to apply into hair as it is a very very dry product.  Extremely sticky and impossible to wash out of hair.,0
Item never worked. It would beep intermittently and wind the hair half way then slow down to a stop. Either it isn't authentic or this one is a lemon.,0

This product may work for some but my hair texture which is very fine hated this product. It was very sticky and never made my hair feel drier. If anything it made me feel like I needed to wash it asap.,0
I don't know why they don't make a bigger size but this doesn't work as well as I expected.,1

This product did not live up to my expectations.  I had significant chipping on my nails the same day I applied the product.,0
"This product is for my baby. We tried on her dry skin and seems to work well.

Easy to use an quick to use. Careful when applying it can get messy if not done right,1
"Very nice. Thanks,",1
I'm on my 3rd jar & wouldn't go without these pads. Great product,1
"This liner takes a little finesse to apply, as does most liquid liner. It has great staying power and does not transfer once it has dried. Once dried there is a slight sheen - almost wet looking. There is something a little harsh looking about the line - but that may be due to my being a little older, and I prefer a more natural shadow, so the liner is very bold by contrast.",1
Lasted just over a year and 2 months now it will no longer hold a charge,0

Not that great,0
didnt smell like it should,0
"The product itself is great. My hair is extremely bad, I use hot tools every other day. It really does it job and works as it claim. It soften my hair, less split ends and I no longer have to use fixing spray. It is truly is an all-in-one-product.
Problem was, when I received the product, It was already used. There was no packaging, the bottle looked old and there was already some product in the pump.
However the product itself is amazing!",1
I love Image products. But I don't like this one. I should have listened to the reviews that said it burns and smells like medicine. My skin is not sensitive at all. I have used many products for my skin and even had peels. But I dread putting this particular product on before bed. So unfortunately I wasted money and don't have any results.,0
Maybe I need a tutorial but this stuff is very messy going on.,0
"I bought this shaving cream as a ""luxurious"" gift to myself. It's very expensive, and usually I go for a more basic shaving cream. But, I had had a rough time, and I figured I deserved a little treat.

I'm sorry to say, but I am very disappointed with this product. In my opinion, it is way overpriced, and does deliver on any of its promises. Let me summarise my complaint point-by-point:

1) It's very thin. When you put it on your hand, it just slips through your fingers, almost like water
2) It does NOT make facial hair soft (like a shaving cream is supposed to)
3) The result: lots of razor burns, and the tube of so-called shaving cream only lasts two weeks.

Men all over the world: I recommend you to look somewhere else for your shaving needs.",0
"While this works as well or better than any of the other Reuzel products, the initially very appealing smell is very strong and doesn't fade much as the day goes on. It's a very strong and distinctive smell and you'll have to wash it out to get rid of it.",1
"Doesn't do what I wish it would. My hair is still kind of frizzy.  Thought it would give it more texture, but it doesn't.  :(",0
I've been using this product for a year or so and just love it!,1
A nice light conditioner for someone (like me) with naturally pin straight Caucasian hair that is very thin. It is weightless and adds the right touch of condition. Now it smells like chemicals and there is no fragrance (hint it needs one). When you apply you add a bit of water and it suds up a bit. There isn't soap in your hair that is how the conditoner works.,1
"Wow....I have to think twice about feeling safe purchasing products via Amazon.  This is considered ""Hazardous"" material and cannot be returned.....even if it does not spray out anything (after wrestling with it for about 30 minutes, got few drops out but NO spray).  I guess it is ONLY dangerous when you are trying to ship it back...not when they are shipping it to you and take your money.",0
"not functioning after 35 uses! plus it turned the fine hairs into darker thicker follicles so my hair is worse! get lazered or electrolysis, this is a waste of $$.",0
"Like others, I purchased the applicator thinking that I might get more even coverage than just using the container.  Like others, I realized that it was not necessary or useful to have the applicator.  Don't bother buying this.  It works -- it's just that it's very focused on one area, so you get heavy amounts of fiber in a line instead of in a diffuse manner over the scalp.  I'm sure if I practiced I might get a better spread of fibers using this tool  but why would I try, when the original XFusion container does just as good a job?",0
Always works perfecty to elimate my frizz.,1

"I have sensitive skin.  I have to use the oil free formula of basically everything, but I've been using the Zirh eye cream and have been very happy with it.  I thought maybe I could get away with using their anti-aging cream.

No such luck.  Broke out real bad about two days after I started with this stuff.  I can't tell you whether or not it works.  I couldn't get that far with it.

If you've got sensitive skin, this is not something you want to play with.

So very nice - creamy and smooth. A staple for me. I just ran out of it and bought some Trader Joe's cocoa butter in a tub to hold me over. My wife says I smell like the inside of an awful taxi. I am now the butt of her jokes until Prime kicks in and I get mah replacement.,1
"This product was light weight and did not weigh down my super fine, fragile post menopausal hair. It did keep flyaways from  However, it provided minimal shine. Keep in mind that my hair is super problematic and fragile. On more normal hair this might work better. I liked the product and it was less expensive than others of this genre yet worked equally well.

Overall, though, i am going to resume using the least expensive drug store hair oil spray. If I use just a smidge of that (any brand) on the ends, and work it through, it gives a nice shine, manages flyaways and seems to be nurturing to my hair",1
Not worth the money,0
I wish I could give this awful item less than one star. After one use only it stopped rotating. Avoid this at all costs. $80 down the tubes. Live and learn.,0
Musgo creams are great. The scents are a little unconventional but they have some performance aspects that are great. If you are used to other creams like the Taylor of Old Bond Street products or Truefitt & Hill these work a little different. Musgo requires a little more water and tends to dry out quicker. Its a little more work to get as much lather as well. However the lanolin in Musgo provides excellent skinn conditioning and cushion during the shave. I actually prefer to mix a little Musgo with a TOBS cream with a complimentary scent to get the best of both. For instance the Musgo Orange amber goes great with the TOBS grapefruit. The oak moss mixes well with TOBS  sandalwood. The mixture provides a nice smelling comfortable shave. Like I said the Musgo scent are unconventional. Not bad just unconventional. That's less noticeable once it's lathered if you are using it straight and not at all if mixed. I think the lanolin is the unusual smell. Every wet shaver should try Musgo though. It's really good stuff.,1
Dries hair very fast. Nice that it has three different heat settings. Allows you to dry hair quickly without using excessive heat. Great for controlling frizz.,1
I do. It like this head at all.  Its too soft and I am used to the other heads.  It doesnt feel like its cleaning its so soft.,0
The product seems fine but the tube I received seems to be dried out. This item will be returned.,0
"I previously used this item while staying at a Hotel resort and spa, and I absolutely loved it. When I found it on Amazon, I was excited to put in an order, however when I received the item, the smell of the content was unbearable for me. I have not and will not use it. I will make another purchase, but only at a local salon.",0
Absolutely a beautiful color.  You won't regret your purchase.  I was very pleased with how prompt the seller was in getting the merchandise out and it was as described.,1
"Overall, I love this shave cream. It lathers very well, smells pretty good (not great) and it doesn't leave a huge overpowering sent behind.

The lubricity is much, much better than most other brands of shave cream ( I think it's because this is glycerin based), but it does tend to leave a film build-up on my safety razor which then starts to drag and hop across the face as opposed to gliding. To remedy this, before each shave I take the razor apart and give it a good cleaning. I've heard that soaking it in vinegar works as well, but I think it would corrode the metal. Compared to Proraso, the build-up isn't quite as prevalent. With Proraso I noticed the build-up to be much worse.

I much prefer the sandalwood scent over this one, but I think this was cheaper and more available. In case you have never tried it Truefitt and Hill makes the absolute best shave cream on the market. You cannot find any better. If you want to experience the best and closest shave of your life, give it a shot.

These creams are of course not cheap, but you already knew that and you probably already know that quality lasts longer than the cheap stuff.  Finally, if you have sensitive skin or break-out or get razor bumps, these types of shave creams are a must-have!",1
"This is an on and off product. Works for some, doesn't for others. I have sensitive skin. I really did WANT to believe that this product works MAGICAL WONDERS. But no. It did not work too well for me. It did irritate my skin a bit. It only worked on only one pimple. But that pimple took 4 days to actually even show signs that it was working.",0
"Love this product.  Use sparingly at the roots of your hair and to refresh or reactivate, just push your fingertips through your roots.  Absolute essential product!",1
Same problem as everyone battery not hold the charge!!!!,0
"I saw this in a catalog and thought I would give it a try.  I am not a make up wearer.  A little lotion and lipstick daily.  Mascara and eyeshadow only on special occasions.  As I am getting older-40 next month- I wanted something with a little coverage.  I saw this in a catalog and immediately went to amazon.  The second day I wore it I walked into a parent meeting at school and another mother said- ""Wow, look at you looking all fresh and pretty!""  The only thing I had done differently was use this.  I am now on my second bottle.  The first lasted me about 7 months of daily use.  I do 2 small squirts plus a squirt of moisterizer.  I find it to be a little dry to spread by itself without the moisterizer.  The thing I like about it most is my skin color varies greatly throughout the year.  In the summer a get rather tan quickly, yet in winter I am rather pale, but this foundation is usable for me all year.",1
"Guess I should have just bought any regular hair serum for way less $$$$. I don't understand how people say this smells good. Second, it makes my hair greasy if I put too much but if I put a little I see no change. I had high expectations because this brand is pretty popular but I ended up giving it to my daughter since she doesn't blow out her hair. She uses it after shower to somehow reduce tangles, but I didn't pay that much to be using it as a leaving-in conditioner. I wash my hair every two days and blow out my hair every time. I was looking for something to protect and help with frizz and style. This is not the product for that purpose.",0
Adequate self tanner but smells strongly of old pennies. It's kind of gross.,0
"Even though it is advertised to fit Bbayliss hair dryers, it Does NOT fit on a BaByliss Pro Ferrari Red Volare V2 Blow Dryer.",0
"I suppose for very specific types and (tiny) degrees of hair loss/thinning, this might, MIGHT, be useful for certain circumstances. Medium to low resolution (or somewhat distant) photographs and videos, for example. But if your thinking this is going to make you look like you have a full head of thick hair to someone you're having a face-to-face conversation with, think again. Up close, it looks exactly like what it is: colored dust in your hair and on your scalp. It does cover fine hairs and make them look thicker, but it does NOT cling or adhere enough to be practical. It barely adheres at all and you can brush it right out with your hand. It's just dust, after all. It also mottles your scalp and makes it look dirty. I personally think I look better with out it. YMMV.",0
Definitely NOT Biolage Hydra Source!,0
"I can't even begin to explain how amazing this stuff is! Thank you to my hair dresser for introducing me to it!! Wish I'd have known about it years ago!! If you love ""big hair"" and/or love to ""tease"" your hair, this stuff is for you!! Amazing stuff! Def recommend this product!!",1
The mascara smeared during the couple of hours that I had it on. My lashes didn't look special and it was expensive. I returned it.,0
Nice smell without being too strong.,1
It isn't Latisse but a great substitute. I am allergic to Latisse and this is so much cheaper,1
as advertized,1
"You may be curious because this product is extremely cheap and also you see a couple of bad reviews. Let me tell you from my experience. This product is amazing! At my mall, 6.4 fl oz of Chrome cost $85! I used to always buy it from here but when school came around and money was tight, I resorted to Amazon hoping I wouldn't get a fake product. It came in extremely fast and right when I got it I tested it. I had did three sprays, one on the chest and one near the stomach and one inside my shirt. The cologne still smells amazing after an 8 hour shift so it is not weak nor is it diluted with water. It is (as you can tell by the image, held up by a full size laptop mouse.) this product does come in the right size.  So please don't listen to other people and save some big bucks. This product smells good and it's very cheap online. It is the real deal. I hope you guys take my advice and enjoy smelling good while you save big bucks.",1
"I really loved the way the brush felt on my face and it left my face smooth and soft.  However, it definitely caused broken capillaries on my cheeks.  I started with two small ones, then when I used the brush, it went to like 5.  After that, i avoided those areas.  Then I bought the cashmere brush thinking the softest one would not damage the capillaries, but one use of that and I got more! I don't press hard and I do not stay in one area till it beeps, I work much more quickly.  My face is a wreck now even so.  Only laser treatments will get rid of them.  I bought it from Clairisonic directly.  I will either return it or use it on less sensitive areas like my feet.",0
I think it's a great product,1
Love this product to freshen up smelly babies after a dirty diaper (when the smell lingers) and for washing their faces. They love the feel of the cool liquid on a cotton pad rubbing on their faces. It's one of the few things I don't have to bribe them to do.  It leaves them smelling nice and fresh.,1
"Excellent product. My new favorite, for long, thick hair.",1

"The English-language portion of the polyglot silver label of the box of Vichy Liftactiv Supreme says that a user's face will look relaxed and freshened after seven days' use, twice a day.  I have been following my normal pattern of moisturizing my face after showering in the morning and after I clean my face before going to bed.  My face does feel smooth and fresh, but I cannot really judge whether its condition has improved because I'm using this product.  My ""normal"" skin that has been covering my face for many, many years, just feels very good.

The cream itself has a mild fragrance that I didn't notice once I'd applied it.  It did not burn my eyes.  A very small amount goes a long way, and there is no feeling of gumminess that I've experienced with other products that claim to minimize fine lines.

I tend to be very skeptical of some claims that I read on labels and websites, and that applies to the superiority of water from a volcanic spring in France when used in a facial moisturizer.  The product itself, though, passes the test, whatever its claims.  Very pleasant product, soft, moisturized face - that's good enough for me.",1
Use Pert Plus and save your $.,0
"Expensive and over-hyped. Doesn't really even smell unless you stick your nose 3 inches from the flame. Oh and you get to keep a glass jar after. That's actually what you're paying for. I have yet to find a candle similar to Banana Republic Beach House candles they discontinued long ago, but will keep searching...this one isn't it.",0
I have had problem skin my whole life. I have tried many skin care products. Obama has given me the best results.,1
Was not happy it did not hold my curl.,0
love it,1
"while the smell is not entirely unpleasant, it does not smell like the normal Clean Skin I have purchased repeatedly from Sephora, which smells better.",0
thanks,1
Iam so glad to have purchased this keratin treatment the smell is like cotton candy and my nail in the first use look amazing I just got it and I will post another review too see the result in one month time,1
"The fragrance is very nice, four roses essences mixed in honor of four French queens(view my review of the bigger bottle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rose-4-Reines-Eau-de-Toilette/dp/B002B4SSSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rose 4 Reines Eau de Toilette</a>. In general I like L'Occitane, as the fragrances are kind of retro and natural, made of distilled natural oils as in old days. And they don't evaporate so quickly like some ancient-formula fragrances.

It is s nice travel bottle, delicate fragrance even for traveling, not overpowering your nose or the noses of your neighbours, (even on the plane, I hope, if not too much of it is sprayed).But there is a problem with cap. I bought this bottle November 2010, so, maybe it improved already, I want to give the benefit of  doubt. The bottle is simple and retro, yet the tiny cap is so loosely fitting it falls off when the bottle is turned upside down. This makes me uncomfortable in a travel bottle, but is is a spray, and so far never had any accident, to L'Occitane credit, I am not taking the star off from evaluation. Maybe I am just being too picky after all. In travel bottles I prefer snap, click, screw or whatever secure caps are there for non-solid beauty/grooming products. Maybe it is just me. And solid fragrances differ from the liquid formulations. Anyway, the bottle's juice is worth the price.",1
I thought this item was heated but it is not. Maybe that was my mistake. I cannot get it on more than a few eyelasshes so no curling.,0
I don't like giving bad reviews but this doesn't work. I tried all the options and the result was the same: nothing.,0
Great product,1
"This was my first ""upscale"" blow-dryer. While it is a step above any of my previous Target-purchased dryers, I guess I was expecting a little more. I feel like the medium heat setting could be a little warmer, and that the lowest speed setting should be slower. But overall, I am happy, as it dries my shoulder-length hair in less than 10 minutes.",1
Good product.,1
Excellent,1
I like this product but I found the Elemis Sp@home Musclease Active Body Oil to be more helpful.  I was working on a muscle problem I had for a number of years.  I liked the Musclease so much I thought I would try this product.  Both are great products.,1
Product is good and does what it says it's meant to! And obviously great for sensitive skin! Another good Elemis product!,1
"I've had this for maybe a month or two, since having to replace my ten-year-old Conair. I was wary of this style of straightener, as opposed to the scissor-style hinge of my old one, but believe me, this is superior. No more catching your hair in the hinge! What really sold me on this was the removable comb on one side. I was at my wits' end trying to find a model that had a comb like my old one, which is really useful for keeping everything taut and not slipping out from one end of the plates. I'd initially wanted a 2"" wide plate (again, like my old one - can you tell I was attached?) for my thick long hair, but the 1.5"" plates have done a fine job. A little easier to work, even, with when trying to catch the flyaways near my hairline.

The only downside is that the comb is maybe a little TOO removable. My old model's sturdy comb clipped into place. This one just sort of slides into its track and ends up working itself out a bit if you're not paying attention to which direction the hair is pulling from. It's a bit of an annoyance to pause a few times while straightening to push the comb half an inch back into place. Overall, though, a great product.",1
"I was looking for a duo chrome in purple and green. As an allergy sufferer, I like the short ingredients list.",1
"I heard raging reviews from ladies who work at salons, and amazing feedback online about the hot tools curling irons. I was very excited to receive mine. Everything looked normal, packaging was great.. Heated up quickly. Just when I tried it out, I noticed how it would always leave those crimp marks on my hair. But the worst part, it wouldn't even curl my hair! And even if I did get a curl out of it, my hair wouldn't hold it. So idk if it's just my hair, how I curl my hair the way I do or if it's the curling iron. Didn't work out for me so I can't completely say it would work out for you.",0
"I love Shellac, but I'm not paying that price for my pedicure.  This is a great product if you want to match the Shellac colors.  Frankly, it's just a great product!",1
I finally decided it was time to get a more professional hair dryer.  This one does the trick. It has 3 temperature settings and 3 power settings with a cold shot. It comes with the concentrator nozzle which I always use. I don't have issues with it falling off - it's pretty snug on there but easy to pull on/off.  If I use the hottest heat setting it is definitely HOT. I am not sure if it blow dries my hair faster but I think it does. It gives me volume when I use a round brush and lift my roots. I would highly recommend as an affordable more high powered hair dryer. I have not had any issues with it.,1
"i used to use the shampoo and Con from Pureology
i give this a try. Is super expensive and No worth at all
Pureology is half of price musch bette product
i regret put my money on this",0
Great product,1
"I bought this dryer from bed & bath. It's very light, not loud at all. Compare to BaByliss Pro Porcelain Ceramic Hair Dryer this one is much quieter and much lighter. I have thin and frizzy hair, after drying my hair on a high setting I was very pleased with the result. I'm only giving 4 stars because I just bought it couple of days ago.",1
"When my wife attempted to use this product, she found that the spray did not work.  I contacted the company but never got a response.  I took the spray assembly apart after noticing that it was not connected to the siphon tube.  I was able to properly seat the siphon tube and now the unit works.  My wife and I like the fragrance but won't be buying this company's products due to their lack of interest in their customers.",0

This hair dryer was puchased in 9/16 and is already broken .  I have no way to return it or replace it and it was NOT cheap!,0
"Despite all the good reviews I wasn't very happy with this product. First of all, I need a lot of it to wash my hair throughly and I don't have a very long hair... After I rinse it, it feels very very dry so you will need a good conditioner. At first my hair looks shinny and nice, (but that's also because I use a great conditioner and hair treatments from the same brand). What I have noticed since I started using this shampoo is that 2-3 days after I wash it, my hair gets greasy, specially in the scalp. And this is very new to me because it never happened before. I'm a huge fan of Davines, so I will try another shampoo.",0
Not as good what I was using previously,0
I didn't notice a change!,0
"Love the product and what it does for my skin, however, I also ordered a different brand on groupon for less than half the price and that has proven to work just as well.  Quality seems to be the same.  Jury is out on the cost vs. other brands.",1
Love it!,1
The bottle looks like it was already used or a return that was recycled and the top came off and spilled shampoo in the box.,0
Love love love it!! I had the older model of this for 5 yrs and it just quit working so I bought the new updated version. Worth the money far better than any chi,1
Great hairspray but the nozzle broke after two weeks.  Definitely not worth the price as it is unusable.,0

I've had 2 and BOTH lost the teeth at least 75% of them.  I purchased the last one on Amazon and don't remember where I got the first. I called Calista and they will not stand behind their product unless purchased through their site. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE for a product that cost more than most on the market. I've read many complaints about this very thing.,0
"In a moment of craziness, I spent $70 on this product. I think it is WAY overpriced. I soon afterwards found out that Vitamin C products are hard to stabilize. Once a product oxidizes it turns a yellowish brown color, and it loses potency. Well, this product comes in a yellowish brown color the moment you open the bottle. Plus, the packaging is bad. When you squeeze out the serum by pressing down on the spout, it squirts forcefully out of the bottle and splatters everywhere. This stains clothing and furniture, and is annoying on a $70 product. It is impossible to press out the serum without this splatter occurring. I will be trying Cffectives next, it is clear not yellow, and I am more confident about its stability. Plus it comes in an eyedropper so it won't splatter.",0

"A lot of hype and a bit overpriced. A booklet I have from the brand shows thermal imaging of a face three minutes after spraying with this water. However, they don't show pictures of a face sprayed with cool tap water, which would likely show similar results. I guess it's a guilty pleasure. I've used it for a long time to moisten my face before moisturizer, treatments, and makeup. I've just started using it as a toner by spraying it on a cotton round. Haven't noticed a major difference between this and two cheaper brands I've used in the past. But it's much more useful than a plastic spray bottle of water, as the mist is far finer.",1
"This product absorbs moisture and is helpful for no shower days.  However it

excellent product!,1
"I would give this product five (5) stars for being AWESOME but the nozzle stopped working after less than 10 uses and now I have a lot left in the bottle that I can't use.  When you depress it, only gas/air comes out.  Shame on the manufacturer for bad engineering!",0
"This is a lightweight clear oil/serum.  My wife has been using it on her d&eacute;colletage to try and erase some of the sun damage done in her earlier years.  She has been using it daily for about a month and has not noticed any real improvement.  At first she was using it on her face too, but got worried that the oily consistency would make her acne prone skin break out and switched to the C complex for her face instead.  The product claims there may be a slight tingling sensation when applied, but that continued use would remedy this, however she did not experience any at all.  The bottle will last for several months as you only need to apply 5-7 several drops to your face, neck and d&eacute;colletage. For the price I would hope that it would work.  Perhaps it only works on mild sun damage and aging skin?",0
Nice long big barrel for my thick long wavy hair. Easy to use & comfortable. I wish it had an automatic turn off. Pretty sweet tool for the price.,1

I have a fair/medium skin tone and it seems a bit bluish, on a more olive complexioned person it would probably look better.

What I've taken to doing is wearing butter's foundation coat (a nice matte neutral color) either alone or with a coat of clear over the top.",1
Be ware this is not an actual product size but a free tester you get .  The product size is like a small salt shaker.  It didn't work on my thick medium length hair.  I ordered hundreds of products from Amazon. This is  baby powder in a tiny bottle.  This is the most deceitful product I ever purchased from Amazon.,0
I have used this product only twice. I went to use it again and it wouldn't even turn on. I am past the return or replace point but I would never buy from this company again. A complete waste of $200.,0
Didn't work with me at all. I use clearasil but I was on you tube a day and a youtube said helps to peel off darkspots over time so I tried it and my acne got worst so I went back to my origanl cleansers and a couple days the acne cleared up bit I got more scars to deal with though,0
"I've always been curious about this stuff, since I have been losing my hair for about 25 years now.  I never bought any because of the price, and, I am not all that self conscious about my balding anyway.  However when a good friend of mine got some for his thinning hair I was so impressed by how it good it looked that I begged him to let me use it just once.  The color wasn't exactly right but that didn't matter since it was only a test... Unfortunately I have to say that even though it worked very well on my friends hair that is only thinning, it was a total bomb for me who has a real beach head coming in on the top.  Quite simply, one has to pay very close attention to the description of how this stuff says it works.  It clearly states that it needs or works by bonding with your existing hair.  If you have either no, or hardly any existing hair, it just comes out looking like a lot of very homely fuzzy stuff.  I tried it all over the top of my head and it simply stuck to it, and then ended up looking like some kind of very short, fuzzy, sparsely covered type dog hair.  Very ugly and fake looking and not at all worth the price or the bother for sure....

As for how it worked for my friend I have nothing but praise.  It was amazing the way it blended in and stuck to what thinning hair he had and combed out looking completely natural.  If you really want to see how this stuff looks in use, type the name of it into google and go to videos.  There are several online that depict a true demonstration of how good this stuff works on thinning hair.  Even on very thinning hair.  But not a one I found showed someone with a real Dr. Phil look, or even just a completely bare bald spot.  Without some minimal hair to cling to you are like me, fresh out of luck and too late.  If my hair was only thinning I would consider the hefty price of this worth it I believe.  Just remember for the truly bald, its a bust...

In conclusion, I decided to take off one star on the rating simply because I feel that despite this working very well on thinning hair, I believe that the description should more forcefully state that its not for bald heads. I don't think it does clearly enough to satisfy me. Not even the manufacturers web site that has a more detailed description says anything about bald heads.  Personally I feel that the majority of the negative reviews of it comes from those that are too far ahead with hair loss and just came out with a big fail on their part.  It was with me for sure.  Highly recommended only  for those with thinning hair that this stuff can cling too, and that feel hiding it well is worth the price... : )",1
"As a bath and shower wash, it's as good as can be. It's easy to generate a lasting lather. After washing up, there is no residue or dryness. One just feels clean. However, it doesn't smell like grapefruit in my opinion. It doesn't smell bad, but it doesn't smell good either. It's a ""strange"" smell. The scent should be tweaked just a little more. One thing I didn't like was the short stroke of the pump. I prefer longer and fewer strokes.",1

"This device is honestly just a little odd, and I am not sure what to make of it. For the price, I would expect a bit more, but it comes off as one of those ""As Seen on TV"" devices that you play with for awhile and soon put away. It is supposed to emulate a two-finger massage for under your eye, but that's not what it feels like. The ""fingers"" are rough and mechanical (Obviously) and it actually kind of hurts. It's also not the most comfortable thing to hold while moving it around your eyes.

My wife and I tried this for a bit before giving up. The next day we didn't see any results for all our fiddling with it. I think she is going to give it another go, but for me this was a bust.",0

It MUST be worn ALONE...if you try to put makeup on top, this product starts to ""ball up"" little pieces on your face...probably because of the zinc....It definitely works to keep you from getting burned...but the product is difficult to manage. Should be in a pump container, not a squeeze type.",0
I've been a fan of Mario Badescu since I was 19. That being said I started using the facial spray as setting spray and or as a refresher for the last 5 years (sometimes I use it with the urban decay setting spray to set my make-up if I know I'm going in for the long haul for the day). It smells great and you feel refreshed and skin feels supple after a few spitz. Highly recommend for face and hair! Plus it's less costly than most refesher sprays sold at Sephora.,1
"Love the color and that it's less toxic than most polishes, but I've worn it twice now and both times it has chipped almost immediately. Definitely not long lasting.",0
"Have been using for 2 years. Was recommended by a dermatologist for some large pimples. When the spot starts to get a little swollen or puffy and I apply this to the red or puffy area a couple times the pimple does not grow the white head and puss. Instead the pimple gets neutralized, the extra bacteria from the pimple dries up and flakes off like a super thin scab. TMI??
I try to use it daily but sometimes when I am in the clear I stop for a couple days and the pimples come back and I reach for this because I can rely on the formula.
However it burns, and I do think that the line should include a soothing gel.
I know that there is water available from this line but sometimes I want a moisturizing facial from this company as well.
Acne is not something that can be cured  but mine is being treated really well thanks to this product.",1
"My skin is pretty hardy, I've used plenty of various products and never had an issue (I use to work in a derm office).  But the first time I used this product my skin felt stingy and burny.  The second time I used it same feeling.  I tried this product 3 days after the last incident and same thing.

The product seems to be creamy and should be relatively mild but for some reason, it didn't do well with my skin.  Pity.",0
Bummmmmer. Literally broke me out with lumps on scalp. Sad because my hair was on point! Another review mentioned it contains lyeI like some had a horrible reaction.,0
"I was disappointed when I opened package and found gold top all dented.  The bottle is so pretty and I was hoping to leave it out on my vanity. But, I must say the polish is great! It went on smoothly and I only had to use one coat. I would have given it 5 stars if not for dented top.",1
"This product line was recommended to me via a medi-spa when I had an IPL facial. As a 38 year old female with combination acne prone sensitive skin, I was scared to try a product I thought might either make me break out or react negatively. I had tried other products in the past from the drug store (Neutrogena) or beauty counter (Clinique), or online (Paula Begoun) all with mixed mediocre results.

The price was a little steep, but the three week trial kit this came in let me test drive it. I used each product in the trial kit as directed. After the three weeks had passed, my skin was clearing and managing the retinol very well! The brightness, tone and texture of my skin improved daily with very visible results! I decided to invest in all the full size versions of the products in the kit, and though it was pricey, it was completely worthwhile.

After two months of use, my skin is possibly the best it has ever been.  I have very minimal to no breakouts. I don't have to wear much makeup at all beyond a little foundation or concealer to even out my color.  Lines by my eyes and mouth are reduced. Redness is gone.  Old acne scars and discolorations are fading. the texture is GREAT.  I have gotten compliments on my skin lately. (You look healthy / are glowing! / look so young! You can't be 38!) I almost wish I had taken before and after photos. I cant believe it, but I actually threw out all the other non-PCA skin care products in my cabinet without hesitation.

Anyway, PCA Skin is an awesome line.  It does not disappoint. It is gentle yet effective. No greasiness or icky perfumes.
You get what you pay for with PCA Skin.",1
"The best for my skin, I need it to hydrate my skin",1
"Sorry, this is just not a good product in my opinion.  Not only is the product very small but it's so transparent that it hardly adds color.  I am redhead and very light skinned, and it's still too faint.  It also has an almost ""oily"" texture and just sits on the cheeks.",0
"Um.. they're being sued because people are losing their hair and going bald from using this product. The list of ingredients they provided doesn't include ALL ingredients. They claim to be sulfur free but actually contains sulfur, for example.",0
"I was hoping for something akin to the VL lip stain.  This is NOT it.  It's a creamier type base, doesn't stain. Doesn't stay either.  Another item to go to the bottom of the drawer...",0
Great curling iron at a great price. Doesn't fry your hair. I curl my hair everyday with it and it doesn't dry it out.,1
"It's great for everyday use. You won't get salon quality results, but for the price and time you spend the results are excellent. Two important tricks I've learned are 1) make sure your hair is 90% dry and 2) try to take smaller sections-you'll get better results. Go for it,it's a great product.",1
Stuff really works!!!,1
I love this product but it arrived totally smashed up the base colour i use the most was totally crushed and it's dust lying over the other two colours .  I'm so disappointed.,0
MY GIRLFRIEND LOVES IT  !!!,1
"this stuff is gross, smells like it's been in this bottle for 25 years.  If you like old perfume smell mixed with grass this is your cologne.",0
I really like the roller set but there are just not enough rollers to do all my hair at once.  I have to wait for the first batch to cool and then reheat them and finish using them in my hair.  Why don't you sell a set of extra rollers for purchase?,1
"Unfortunately, the candle was crammed in a box that it just barely fit into, with just one small piece of paper. I pulled it out of the box when it arrived, and the glass was cracked all the way down one side. Smelled wonderful. I'm sure it would've been great had it been packed correctly.",0
It works GREAT! THANKS:),1
"This makes your hair shinny, but that's about it.",0
"I don't really know what this stuff is supposed to be. It's too runny for a hair gel. It comes in a big bottle, but it's pretty much unusable in my opinion. Paul Mitchell has some other gels that are better than this garbage, however I like Redken's hair gels much better than any of the Paul Mitchell ones I've tried. Try Redken For Men Grip Tight Holding Gel, Medium Control - it smells great and has the right balance of hold and natural weight.",0
VERY GREAT PRODUCT INDEED. NOTHING BAD TO DECLARE. I would order it again.,1
The formula for this product has changed. It doesn't work for my hair at all! I'm returning this product. It's now a thick gel consistency. Totally different from how the product looked before.,0
"It is a TINY bit too greasy, but nice to combine a moisturizer and SPF in one step. I really like this product and use it every day.",1
Smell is great but it has done nothing for thinning hair or scalp care. And I refuse to pay for whole system. So that may be on me but I've been sucked down that rabbit hole before with hair care.,0
"Bright color, looks amazing!",1
Perfect but the price...,1
I was so excited to get this so as soon as it came I popped it open. The packaging was covered in sticky glue. (And still is because I can't seem to figure out where is coming from) It totally dried out after only two weeks. Turned clumpy and hard and won't go on smoothly.,0
"Pros:
1. The brush is ultra light weight, and hence very easy to hold.
2. It is made of boar bristles, which softens hair.

Cons:
1. Because the brush has cork where bristles are attached, I struggle to get my hair to glide, so I end up pulling, and pulling, which hurts, and pulls out hair.
2. My hair gets tangled when I try to glide.
3. Dense bristles make it hard to grip my wavy hair.
4. Expensive",0
didn't like to runniness of it,0
"Would love to have a pump foaming cleanser but my favorite, Skin Effects for Sensitive Skin, is no longer available.  Tried a few new ones, including Aveeno Ultra Calming - all of them caused an immediate reaction. Toleriane is the only one that didn't irritate my skin.  It's also great at not drying out my skin and leaving that tight feeling along with flaking skin.  Skin is nicely softened in addition to being clean.  I've got dry to normal skin, not sure how this would be for oily skin.  If you suffer from rosacea and have trouble finding products that don't cause a flare up, I highly recommend trying this one.  Much more expensive than the Skin Effects I used to buy at CVS, but worth it to prevent the dreaded red bump breakouts!  I follow it up with metrogel 1% (only at night).  Seems to be working.",1
This is the only way I can have fingernails. Use as directed and  it works!!!!  I get compliments All the time on my nails!,1
"I wonder if this is not a knockoff from Stilla products? The one I received patina 03. You can never pull the wand out and not have the sponge applicator completely too saturated with product. I have tried scraping it on the side of the tube, but that does not really help much. Very disappointed. I will from now on only order make  up from the store.",0
Solid.,1
I have used Prevage before and this is NOT it. It came in a convincing bottle but has a smell too it that real Prevage does not. There is also a hole in the bottom of the bottle that looks like it has been tampered with. I am worried now what I have put on my face!,0
"I didn't expect to like this, thinking it was Just Another Basic Moisturizer (but with organic ingredients - yawn). But color me impressed.

Shea butter is the 2nd ingredient after the ""juices"".  Because of this, the texture is actually a delight -- imagine shea butter diluted down to an emulsion, creating a thin, flexible, protective film on your face that acts as a barrier/primer.  It has that matte drydown often found in shea, but is much thinner and lighter -- the slight firming sensation acts as a temporary ""freeze"" while filling in pores and fine lines. Amazingly, I found it effective as a wind chafing barrier, cushioning my face from the biting cold. I love that it is non-oily in texture, allowing me to layer stuff over it. No pilling at all -- compatible with your other serums/sunscreens/foundations.

Now, a moisturizer that simply hydrates is not good enough! we demand more from our products these days. To show truly efficacious results, this cream has to DO something else. That's where the AHA's come in. The fruit acids to act as low level AHA's (i'd guess it's 5% or less), so you won't see visible brightness overnight -- but over a few weeks, you'll feel your skin texture getting smoother, more refined.

The AHA's are crucial in this product because without them, your dead skin cells would just accumulate, and the lipid ingredients in this cream would simply bind those dead cells together, causing dullness and clogs. Also it is silicone-free (silicone is notorious for causing clogs), and it has other ""good-for-you"" nutrients like antioxidants and DMAE. But really--it's the AHA's that do the most.

In summary, this formulation is a good combo of light AHA's and hydrating ingredients while steering clear of the ""no-no""s. If you are looking for an immediate refining/ brightening effect, only a professional peel or IPL/laser treatment would do that; i'd recommend this cream as a good ""maintenance"" cream that gradually further refines skin on a slower basis, albeit much gentler.",1
a little hard to squeeze the liquid out. But like the shampoo,1
just ok.  makes your hair sticky and doesnt have very good holding power.  waves fall out soon after spraying.  big diappointment for how much it costs.,0
"Good color, looks like natural nail. I ordered this when I was out of town and really needed natural and it fit the bill.",1
"FAKE BEWARE. Been using for years, this is definitely not the real product.",0
"I'm 31, and suffered with hormonal acne after going off of birth control over the summer. Now that I've got my acne reasonably under control with antibiotics, I have been left with a lot of post inflammatory hyper-pigmentation and being 31, am extremely self conscious. I have always had great skin, and now I look like a teenager post-puberty.  I had read about Effaclar in New Beauty magazine and decided to give it a shot. This product is really great. While it burns a little bit, it's great for plumping up the skin and smoothing out the overall texture. I haven't noticed a drastic reduction in my PIH, but the redness is somewhat reduced and this product is one of the only products I can use for fine lines that is also effective on active breakouts.  My mother even commented on the improved texture of my skin and wanted to know what I'd been doing.  Overall, a nice little serum.  Will be purchasing again.",1
i will definitely repurchase it!!,1
It doesn't work me at all!!! I wish I had never bought such an expensive and useless shampoo.,0
I really like this product. La Roche Posay is a great skin care brand. Serozinc helps me with redness on my face and razor bumps on legs. It just feels like plain water when sprayed on and dries quickly. I will definitely repurchase. I have ordered from Apothekary before and had no problems.,1
"I got this for my husband who needs to wear a high SPF sunscreen. We both prefer the mineral type but in high levels, it leaves a white ""mask"" effect.  This does, too, but not to the degree other brands we've tried.  It's also not too greasy and absorbs well after a 10-15 minutes.  At that point, if you blend it in some more, the white cast is almost invisible.",1
"I've been using OPI Start to Finish for quite a few years.  It's not cheap, but it's the longest lasting two-purpose product I've found yet.  In the past year, OPI introduced a ""formaldehyde-free"" formula, and since I've always read how bad formaldehyde is for our nails, I tried it. At some point while using it, I started having problems with my nails peeling! It was horrible. It never occurred to me that the ""healthy"" product could be the cause, so when I ran I out, I bought a second bottle.  The peeling problem continued, and finally the light bulb went off.  I went back to this ""Regular"" formula, and guess what?  The nails are healing.",1
"Works well, but expensive for a brush.",1
"My wife loves this:I have had the opportunity to try MANY salon hair oils for shine and damage, and this one is the BEST.  Im currently dealing with massive breakage due to over-drying my hair and overuse of a flat iron.  This oil in conjunction with the Lanza Healing Oil Shampoo and Conditioner is bringing hope back to my life.  The combination of these three products has made my hair feel like it hasn't felt in years.  I forgot hair could feel this healthy.  I don't care if its expensive This stuff is worth every penny.  For those who are concerned that its a fake product, I can tell you that mine wasnt.  Ive taken a picture of the bottle I purchased about three months ago at a reputable beauty supply store and the product I received from Amazon yesterday.  They are exactly the same; the text on the bottle, the aroma, the feel of the product.  The exact same.  When I use this product, I usually dry my hair slightly, let it air dry a few minutes, put about a quarter size in my palm and pull it through my hair.  If you put the oil in while your hair is damp, itll speed up the dry time, and then if you want to add a little more at the end for shine, you can do that.  I use it pretty liberally, and its taken me three months to get through half of a bottle.  The only caveat I would have is that I don't love the aroma.  Its hard to describe perhaps a little powdery, a little old-lady perfume-y.  That being said, the product is so good, Im willing to overlook that.  Give your hair a treat!",1
"I found this to be a very HEAVY fragrance and I didn't smell anything that resembled cotton. The packaging is nice, and it looks like a great gift as long as you don't mind a very heavy, strong scent. The smell wasn't exactly unpleasant but it wasn't what I would imagine at all from reading the description and being highly sensitive I found it overwhelming. If you are expecting a ""soft sensual"" fragrance I believe this is mislabeled!! Beware!",0
"My husband first tried this product as part of a gift set that I got for him. Of course, this was the first thing gone.
I bought this bottle for him for Christmas and he absolutely loves it!

Scent - As some of the other reviewers said, it does have a scent, but it is plesant. May not be as suitable for sensitive skin. It also lingers.
Texture - As it is an oil, it is very smooth and liquid. You just need a small dab to do the job. A little goes a long way
Usage - My husband claims that this make it easier to shave. He gets fewer cuts and it is very very smooth afterward. I don't think you even need to use after-shave as the oil is moisturizing and keep the skin hydrated.
Price - this is my only complaint. The price is a little high. It is a good product, so you are truly getting what you paid for!

I would definitely buy this again.",1
"I don't believe this is the real product.  My hair is beginning to fall out after use.  It is not the same product, the real cleanser 3 is pearly, this is clear.  Also, the label on the front is pasted on.  Manufacturer on the back says Wella Corporation and made in Mexico.  That is not on my 'real' bottle.  Not happy with this purchase.",0
Easy to apply and the 0.5 oz bottle will go a long way as you only use a few drops.  Softens nails to make it easier to remove ingrown portions.,1
Seems old,0
I have skin allergies and this is the first cream that has not made my skin sting!  I love it!  I just wish it came in a bigger bottle.,1
"Love the color- could have broken in poor packaging, was fortunate it didn't",1
"Did not like the scent, moreover, it does not last for more than a couple of hours at max. Would not buy again!",0
"This may be a knock-off Jurlique product as there are many, many discrepancies in the design of this tube to the original including the material for the tube, the ingredients listed and the ""cyclone"" icon used by Jurlique.  Just saying......

"Great product, great size for traveling.",1

"I have received compliments on the smell from friends, but it is really pricey for kiddo shampoo. If you can afford it, go for it.",1
"The color has separated, so it isn't all one color green. My advice: don't buy nail polish online. Buy it in stores.  This nailpolish seems old.",0
"I got this as a sample from another order. I like how it moisturizes well, it's not greasy at all and absorbs really well. The one thing I don't like is the banana smell, it smells just like ripe bananas but a little sweeter. I'm not a big fan of bananas in the first place so it's more of a personal preference, but if you like bananas, go for it!",1
"Used this for the first time the other day..The shower cream is nice, creamy and it smells pretty good..I didn't use the puff that came with it though, I used a washcloth, thinking it may do a better job at exfoliation. Used it on my arms, upper and lower. Afterwards, used the lotion. It doesn't take much. I could tell right away that it worked really well. I used to just use The Body Shop's olive body scrub on my arms, but that really took a lot of scrubbing.  This product is amazing in that you don't have to scrub yourself raw and the lotion is really smooth.  The day after, I noticed my arms are a lot smoother and don't itch or feel dry like before and this product is made to break down the keratin..regular body scrubs don't. I will purchase this product again !!",1
Not a fan. Impossible to remove and I didn't even get the waterproof version. The brush is okay. The coverage is okay. Not worth the money,0
Best perfume ever!,1
"This hairdress had an awful smell and tried to do a deep condition with but couldn't get passed the smell, so washed out.  Gave to someone who liked it.  Wouldn't recommend to nobody who don't like musky harsh smellls.",0
Does not work at all for covering dark roots.,0
This is also a moisturizer has soft texture. I use this in the morning. My skin went really dry after using La Roche Posay skincare products. I wish I can get my money back,0
"Very disappointed, scent does not last long at all. Must be old",0
"Adds volume to hair.  My hair is very limp after washing, and this product is very helpful for styling.  I have to use another more holding spray afterwards, as I live in a very humid climate.",1
Great product,1
A+++,1
"I did not like it, it did not stay on it flaked off.. Had a glossy finish,,",0
The cologn smells good.,1
The color is very pretty but after applying all 3 layered steps to this polish I was very disappointed that it didn't last past a day.,0
It fried my hair. It doesnt protect that well. I had to stop using and bought something else,0
Nothing special. Found this product harsh on color treated hair.,0
"Very nice texture for lipgloss, not too moist or gooey.  Will definitely order again",1
"Only four stars because I've only used it twice, but I am already seeing some very good reduction in redness.",1
"smell was ok, pine scent. Wore it once and my armpits were itchy because of it. haven't tried it since. Think it's just my body saying no...",0
This polish is not nearly as light an aqua color as the picture on Amazon. It is pretty and is OPI sonis hreat quality but wasn't the color I had hoped for.,0
"I had used Latisse in the past, and thought this might be a less expensive solution, but it did not made my lashes grow like Latisse did. I am going back to Latisse.",0
"I wear my thick, shoulder-length hair in a layered bob, and I like styling products that boost volume and give definition to the layers.  This is a good texturizing paste, though I think the whole rigmarole with clapping your hands to create fibers is kind of gimmicky.

I use a pea-sized amount then I clap my hands ten times (while rolling my eyes), and then I work the paste through my hair starting at the roots.  I like to wear my hair with a bit of wave to it, and this product does a great job of lifting and separating the waves, giving my hair the messy/tousled look that Im trying to achieve.  This product does not make my hair sticky  in fact, my hair feels clean and soft.  If I finish with just a bit of hairspray my hair will hold its shape for hours without requiring a touch-up.

Some things to keep in mind

*Use a small amount of product (you can always add more)
*Make sure the product is clear before you apply it to your hair
*Expect to experiment a little; if you're not used to working with a paste there is a learning curve",1
So far I love this stuff! I have 10 weeks to go and not a single stretch mark!,1
I have bought my third and final Hot Tools purple coated curling iron.  I returned one of them already and realize it is a product defect: the heat destroys the purple protective ceramic coating within a month of daily use and then fries the hair. Very disappointing product and I will be searching for an uncoated well reviewed heat protecting but effective curing iron.  I am surprised the company has not addressed this product defect.,0
No discernible improvement. Don't waste your money.,0
Love this scent!,1
"I used this product for two months with the cleanser and can't say that I was real impressed. My hair is thick, curly and color-treated. It felt clean and soft but was still frizzy on the lower third of my long hair.",0
I have had the luxury of taking 3 baths with this product. It turns the water an ocean blue while the aroma has completely made all the stress from my day go away. I'm not sure if it made me that much more tired since I'm always sleepy after a long bath but I can definitely see it being effective if stress is something that keeps you from falling asleep.,1
"Arrived with out a top on and not in box, did not like that. Product seems to work fine .",1
"I've long been curious about StriVectin products.  I also tend to splurge on facial products so I liked the notion of something that would enhance the effectiveness of what I've already been using.  I've been also using the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clarisonic-Mia-2-Sonic-Skin-Cleansing-System-Lavender/dp/B00B9UE8P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clarisonic Mia 2 Sonic Skin Cleansing System, Lavender</a>&nbsp;which claims to improve your skin's absorption of Vitamin C, but this was the first topical product I've seen that claims to boost performance of your skin care routine.  To give context to the rest of the review, I'm a 30-something with skin that is acne-prone but also sensitive and dry as a side effect of two rounds of Accutane in the past.  As a result, I look for products that make my skin look soft and hydrated, while avoiding things that overly irritate my skin or aggravate breakouts.

When opening this product I first appreciated how well packaged it is.  My bottle came tightly sealed in plastic and not a drop was unaccounted for.  Given how expensive this is per ounce I much appreciated that none is wasted.  The instructions, however, leave a lot to be desired.  It seems to be one instruction sheet for many StriVectin products.  In fact, at first I thought it was a sheet for the wrong product until I realized the Booster Oil was mentioned, just for only a couple of sentences.  It's a shame because with a product this expensive I always want to better understand how it works and how to best apply it for maximum effectiveness.  Here the instructions were simple and straight forward.  Apply 2-3 drops to my face with or without moisturizer and then follow up with my usual serum.  It didn't specify that it had to be StriVectin Serum so I used&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ole-Henriksen-Truth-Serum-Collagen-Booster-1-7-oz/dp/B007W0JA70/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ole Henriksen Truth Serum Collagen Booster 1.7 oz</a>&nbsp;because that's what I'm using at the moment.

When I went to apply this the first thing I realized was that I didn't love the application process.  Essentially you screw off the lid to reveal a dropper.  I like that the dropper gives you a precise measurement of how much you need, but I don't like that the rest of the container is essentially open making it easy to spill.  All the other pricy serums I've used have had more of a pump-type dispenser which makes it harder to spill or waste product.  Applying it to my skin was also tricky because 2-3 drops didn't seem to go very far. Adding it to moisturizer does seem to make it easier to apply to the entire face.  However it does make me wonder if it will make this booster lose its effectiveness and potency because many of the topical prescription products I've used for my face have specified applying it to a clean face and letting it absorb fully before adding lotion.  When applied without the lotion it feels lightweight and absorbs quickly.  Even though it is an oil you are applying so little to your skin that it doesn't feel greasy.  The scent isn't overly pleasant but thankfully is also not noxious and seemed to dissipate quickly enough.  I then followed up as directed with my serum.

Generally I find these things take a couple months to fully see the effects so I plan to report back after I've had more experience with this product to see whether it does seem to be boosting my skincare routine and how long the bottle lasts.  (Yes, it's pricy but similar products I've used that have only required 2-3 drops have lasted me for months.)  To date though I do think it works with what I'm already using to make my skin feel soft and supple.",1
"Love this product, definitely feel a difference in my hair when I use it, but the lid broke the 1st day, it's very cheaply made.",1
dried out my skin,0
"Loved this cream, however, it has parabens, thus the 2 star. I will not use anyting with parabens. So sad because I would've loved to purchase a large bottle of this.",0
I haven't notice any major difference in the appearance of my hands. It made them very soft though. I cant comment on the decolletage yet as I haven't tried it there yet. I didn't have any reaction/irritation from it as warned by others and the product. The only place that can get irritated is under my rings if it gets stuck there. I do like it for the softening effect and will wait to see if I get changes in appearance. If not I am not sure Id spend the $$ again.,1
Works fine but it's falling short of Tweezerman engineering precision.,1
"An excellent razor.  I found a late-20's Gillette old style open comb in an antique store, and it became my absolute favorite razor to shave my head.  Okay on the face too, but I prefer a mid-50's red tip for that.  Anyhow, using a 90 year old razor when I can get a near exact replica didn't seem like the best idea.  I'd like to keep my antique razor nice.  This Merkur Razor proved perfect.  I use it almost exclusively for my head, and I am very pleased.",1

I don't know if the stuff goes bad, or if the ingredients separated, or if its a bad batch or what, but it smells very strongly of chemicals.  It's not the normal smell of the stuff as it has been for the last 2 years.  It's too bad to use.  I'm thinking I'll try Trumper's?",0
Loved my samples could be bigger.  I should have VIDEO my samples.,1
Don't like it.  Just gives slight shiny tint. Almost no color.,0
"This is a very good shave cream as long as you can get it out of the container.

This shave cream is thick, smells nice, and is super slippery. It rinses cleanly and does not leave your face feeling overly dry. I feel like I get a closer shave when using this shaving cream vs other lower end brands. My skin is more on the sensitive side and I have had no reaction to this face wash. A small dab goes a long way, which means this bottle will last a long time.

My one gripe with most of Billy's products is the packaging. These white bottles are too stiff for a thicker product like this. You really need to work to get this product out of the container and its worse as the container gets more empty. Down near the bottom it is almost impossible to get the rest. I contemplated cutting it in half and just scooping it out, but I shave in the shower and that may present a problem. This could deter me from buying this product in the future.",1
my fave,1
"So, let me start out saying that this stuff smells great and I guess that's worth a star. Unfortunately, it doesn't do a thing to protect my face. I have to use pre shave lotion or my face hurts for hours. Also, since I bought this in a Sephora, I thought I was getting more than what is actually in the tub. It's double walled with a large gap between the bottom of the tub and the bottom of the actual container. The inside is tapered as well. I'll stick to the much cheaper and much better (for me) Taylor of Old Bond Street cream.",0
"* Note * I reviewed this cologne already, but I wanted to note that this is about doubled the price over the other, exact same, item you can easily locate when searching.

Every Tommy Bahama Cologne I've tried, I've liked. St. Kitts Eau de Cologne Spray was a Father's Day gift, and I love it. It's refreshing yet manly, clean yet spicy, it reminds me of the tropics, especially after I've worn it for a little while. Everyone I know has commented about how good it smells on me. My favorite Tommy Bahamas scent is the signature amber one, but this comes in a near second, followed closely by the other colognes in the line. It lasts for 4-5 hours before needing a refresher. It is also priced right for the quality and quantity of cologne you get, just be sure to shop around because some sellers jack up the price. Also, if purchased in store, you make be able to score other goodies. I got a classy insulated bag from Belks, and a leather wristband.

Lightly scented.  I like the Art of Shaving shaving creams.  Seem to lather and work well.,1
"I think this is the perfect lotion for mixed skin. Sometimes my face skin gets really oily, so not using the right face-lotion could be a disaster, plus I would look horrible. on  the other hand, sometimes it get really really dry, specially during winter time, so it start hurting. I have been looking for the perfect lotion, and definitely it is not created yet, but it does not mean that they can't be close to it.

To summarize, I would say this is not the perfect lotion, but it is the closest one. Therefore, I do recommend it.",1
"As I woman trying to age gracefully, I'm always trying new creams that are meant to reduce the appearance of fine lines and smooth my skin, so I was eager to try this anti-age regenerative face cream by Skin & Co (made in Italy).

The 1.7 oz glass jar with screw off lid arrives in a nice package and the scent of the medium weight cream is really appealing to me -- yes, it does have a hint of coconut and citrus. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly so I have been using it after washing my face before putting my makeup on in the morning. It eradicates the dryness so makes my foundation glide on more smoothly. It does actually seem to plump the wrinkles so they are not quite as visible. It's not sticky. It does not produce any hypersensitivity reaction on my skin or cause breakouts.

I guess the ultimate question -- is this worth the money -- is a difficult one to answer. Unlike most of the other daytime moisturizers I use, this does not contain SPF to protect against sun damage, but then again, my makeup already has that in it. It works as well as my other products (and does smell better than some!). I like it, and I will definitely use it up, but not sure if I would spend the money to order it again. I guess time will tell. I will continue to use it as a daytime cream because I need a much heavier cream at night.

There are so many products like this on the market and I absolutely prefer it over the serums and oil based liquids. It says it uses organic ingredients and is not tested on animals. I do like it.",1
So greatI will keep using this. The conditioner is kind of useless when I have it. Just like magic on my hair.,1
Color was good.  Not too orangey.  Got many compliments on this one.  GReat color for spring or summer . cross between orange and peach.,1
"Loved the feeling of my face, so smooth",1
"I love this product line. Im not in denial of my hair loss, about 12 years ago i decided to shave it clean and have kept it that way since. I have used just about every shave product available. No joke, every shave product that google can provide has been on my head. Needless to shy ""the art of shaving"" is the best I have ever used...pre shave oil, shave cream applied with the badger bristle brush and the after shave lotion.

Nothing else compares...it's pricey and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the shave cream receptacle is deceiving. The container that its in appears to be much larger than it is. The inside of the container is much smaller than the outside.",1
"Look for replacement to Fat Hair that is no longer in production.  This worked okay, doesn't smell very nice.",1
amazing! does wonders to my hair,1
Hate this blow dryer.  Too much hot air and it fried my bangs. Should have returned,0
"Really not a good iron.  I had the Chi for MANY years and when it died on me I searched for a solid replacement.  This iron was not it - left my hair looking fried and did not give me the straight, soft, silky hair I was used to getting from an iron.  Try the HTC instead - it's awesome and half the price!",0
"I have finally found a scent that is light and fruity, without making me smell like a teenage girl!
The only thing is that the scent doesn't really last too long. Perfect for a date night. But if you want an all-day smell, I'd suggest getting the little roll on to put in your bag.",1
"Not a bad product but just don't like the way my skin feels after I apply it.  My face feels sticky for several hours after I use it, regardless of how much or how little I use.  Like it never really dries or absorbs into the skin so it just sits on the surface of the skin for hours and feels tacky.",0
I use Neocutis serum and love it but this Broad-Spectrum doesn't go on smooth.  I like EltaMD UV Daily better.,0
"Smallest blush I've ever purchased but also the BEST blush I've ever used.  I apply in the morning and don't need a touch up unless I am going out for the night.  Will not be without it.  Love ""Flawless"" and I've ordered it twice but now I'm trying Honey, which I am sure I will love too.  Excellent product.",1
Arrived today and bottle was open with most of its contents spilled inside the packaging.,0
it is a must if you are using the nuface,0
"Item shipped fast! & my dermatologist suggest I use this, my skin is very sensitive I burn easily on my face and get so many sun spots in the summer I hop this helps. Only problem is the product is small",1
"This is my second BKR bottle; I love them. I gave it 4 stars, only because it looks more than 1/2 a size smaller than my 1 liter BKR bottle. I do like that it fits my car cup holder and is nicer for flights and carrying along in a handbag.",1
Covers my sun spots very well.  Some areas need a little more than others.,1
"First of all, it's important to note that I have been using a DE razor for about two years now so I have become proficient at wet shaving using DE razors. I decided to give this razor a try as I wanted a razor with more weight that would cut more efficiently. The adjustable factor was nice too. Everything I read about this razor would suggest it is well built and indeed the build quality is very nice. Having said that, a few shaves in and I am not happy with the design of this razor. I get nicked and cut really out of nowhere even on a setting of 1 or 2. I believe the issue has to do with the following:

1) The front blade guard doesn't actually touch your skin when you are using the razor at the proper angle. That makes it more difficult to keep the correct angle and also doesn't provide any protection against the blade. The blade is basically scraping against your skin unguided. That seems unusual to me for a safety razor. It might as well have no guard at all in that case.

2) The blade gap on the lowest setting is still quite wide. It doesn't get down to a blade gap that you would see on a convention razor like the Merkur 34C, it is much wider than that making the razor more aggressive even on the lowest setting.

3) I don't get much audio feedback as my other DE razors, meaning I can't hear the blade cutting the hairs very well. This makes it difficult to judge whether or not you have the correct angle.

4) The head is huge. Maneuvering on your upper lip will be challenging.

I really wanted to like this razor but can't recommend it because of the aforementioned shortcomings.",0
It doesn't really give you curls its way way too big.... Not good for the price at all be careful.,0
This color is perfect. It goes well with anything you wear. I get lots of compliments when I have it on my nails. It is a soft color.,1
"Did not hold my curl at all. Was really hot and i thought it'd do a great job but it didn't. Using the clamp part hardly curled my hair at all, i had to use it like a wand in order for it to do something. I do have really long hair though, maybe like 3-4 inches past my boobs but isn't that what the XL barrel is for? For people with long hair... A regular curling iron works better than this.",0
The best product ever.,1
"UPDATE #2 - Just manually sharpened for the first time and it sharpened well. A very tiny bit broke off, but is OK in the end. I still wish it was a ""twist up"" style. Nevertheless, I use it often and like it. Seems like it may last longer than I originally expected.

UPDATE - I just realized that this eyeliner pencil has to be sharpened, not twisted, to expose additional product. I guess I shouldn't try new products when I'm tired...In general I prefer automatic (twist) eyeliners to those that need manual sharpening. I'd give it 5 stars if it was self-sharpening.

Original comment: This product itself seems to be very good. Works on lower inner eyelid perfectly. However, the one I received might be defective, because it is impossible to twist the pencil to expose more liner. I'm thinking that even though the pencil is about 7"" long, the liner is only about 3/16 of an inch...I used it once and it seems like I might get two or three more applications before the pencil is depleted.",1
Super pretty sparkles!,1
Receive it today intact and well raped... But I did not receive the mini lipstick as advertised! Insteady I receive a VERY small trial size of the Mary- Lou manizer which I already have the full size ,0
my first time buying perfume without testing it in person first. this one smells like a vacuum cleaner bag.,0
I am over 60 and this cleanser is perfect for me.  It works well for me in the SW Florida climate.  I had originally purchased 2 yrs ago from a Salon here in Fort Myers.  This time purchased from Amazon at better price.  This is a keeper.,1
"The product is probably good but unfortunately, the smell is entirely to strong for me. Every time I put it on my hands, it gives me a major headache. I cannot take real strong smells and so I will just have to give it away. :-(",0
"I used this cream for three days. I woke on morning 4 and under my right eye was extremely swollen, bumpy, and itchy.

I immediately discontinued use of the product, but It's been three days and I still have the rash. I had to make an appointment with my dermatologist to (hopefully) get it cleared up.

Not for sensitive skin!",0
"No trials or evidence of effectiveness for women, yet a woman is pictured in the adverstisment.  Mentions some negative side effects in trials, but does not describe them.  Item returned. Way too pricey to take on such risks.",0
Inferior product. Does not foam well. I ended up throwing it away.,0
"Has a sticky feeling, does not even make your lips soft",0
I am using this product for a different kind of use......for my show dog's hair and it's working just like I expected. Great!,1
"I probably should've ordered a smaller size- originally I had, but changed to this one after reading reviews. I have fine hair that is past my shoulders by maybe 2 inches. It is colored and hi lighted but this is too big- no curls stay- product itself is very nice- I will give it to my daughter with different hair type and longer hair.",1
disappointing performance. Not worth the money,0
This gets a lot of hype about how it makes your skin glow. WRONG! It is a glittery mess.  I've ended up using 1 spray of this with a few sprays of body oil to try to get some use out of it.  The glitter gets on your clothes to. NOT SUBTLE!,0
great,1
"I bought this and used it once in the shower. I saw improvement in the areas where I wanted to see change, immediately. But at the same time, this soap accidentally got into areas where the sun don't shine and baby, let me just say, it was not a pleasant experience. I'm talking red, burning, itching for three days, up in the GROUT, if you know what I mean. Once I realized this was the source of irritation, I went to the google machine and saw that MB has been called out for not being transparent about ingredients. I know everybody's skin is different. I am not a stranger to chemical exfoliants. And I have even used MB products before with great success and no negative effects. But this experience was bad enough that I don't ever see myself using this stuff again, except maybe to clean my tub or something. Lord have mercy.",0
Perfect!  I'm rocking teal toes in order to support Ovarian Cancer which now has new and special meaning for me. Polish hasn't chipped or faded. Looks just like when I painted my toes the first day. Toes got noticed and complimented!!!,1
"Different consistency than others I have bought in the L'Occitane boutiques. Either they changed formula, or it's a fake version.",0
"the material is not welcoming. hard to get on and off. if the lining is not the right temperature (I haven't figured that out yet), they are difficult to remove from either hand. And not so sure about the application of cream and then wearing to soften skin. Maybe it has worked for others but not for me.",0
slow improvements,1
With extended use this made my child break out in little bumps. It also burns when we put it on her dry skin. We won't be using it anymore.,0
Maybe  missing something??  I thought I would splurge and get a great dryer for shiny hair and faster drying....  Hmmmmm...  Its not any better than my old clogged up cheapie dryer...  And it doesnt get very hot.  What am I missing??,0
I had only used this curling iron for a month and it stopped working. Now I'm outside of my return window and can't return it. Do not recommend this product!,0
I really wanted to like this cleanser but I had a really bad reaction to this. I started having massive cystic acne all over. Once I stopped using my face started clearing up.,0
Such an amazing product for dry winter skin! This is by far the best moisturizer I've ever used and a little goes such a long way. I would definitely recommend this product!,1
I like how it covers smoothly over the face...a little pricey.,1
"Did not care the smell of this product.  It also made my hair a bit drier than I like but it may be the same Obliphica shampoo that I used with this product. After using the conditioner, my hair just did not have that protective glide when I combed my wet hair through.",0
The seal was broken on this item and was like water,0
"Thought this product was damaged somehow, so I ordered another. Both cans dispense a very runny liquid which only foams once it is in your hands.  It makes my hair feel stiff, instead of manageable.  Truly one of the worst hair care products I've used; very surprising for Paul Mitchell, since I've been using other Paul Mitchell products for years.",0
"not worth the money, it pulls and rips out your hair. does not get as hot as i would like",0
hair fell out,0
Happy with purchase.,1
Not sure why I don't like this anymore...did they change the formula was Onesta bought out?  doesn't seem the same.,0
Really disappointed with this product. The banana scent was slightly over powering. After a weeks use my skin began to break out.  I thought I would like this as much as the lotion but was disappointed overall.,0
It leaked!!!,0
After few weeks of using I have not notice any positive results.  My face does not even feel clean after washing with it. So far very dissatisfied. I used this brand product about 8 years ago and loved it but now it seems to be different. Why?,0
"Great formula. I can peel CND brand gel off  after a week or two with no damage to my natural nail. I find this MUCH preferable to other formulas/ brands that must be soaked off. I worry about soaking my hands in nail polish remover chemicals for 15-20 minutes. With this brand, I just run a fingernail under the edge of the gel and,most of the time, I can peel it off a nail in one piece. I have zero damage to my natural nails since switching to this CND brand. I use OPI top coat gel. The thinner you make your coats, the longer I find this wears. When my professional nail lady uses CND my nailsmlast for two weeks or longer. Obviously, when I do them myself, I am not as good as she is, but if you have your own light to set the gel, it takes less than 10 minutes to do both hands. I use the Mally light I purched from either HSN or QVC. The Mally gels are horrible, so don't waste yor mo ey buying the entire kit. You just need the light, alchohol, lint free wipes, and a light activated top coat. i am sure there are You tube videos on how to do the process.",1
Love this because of the SPF and the anti-aging ingredients. Gave it four stars instead of five because it could be more moisturizing.,1
Used 2 months for about 6 times so far for my underarm hair. I'm Italian and have a lot of folicles and dark hair. Definitely saw a difference after 3 uses. Finer and much less hair!  But I can only stand the second level....it definitely hurts. But the sting lessens after the hair stops growing.,1
Nice product highly recommended,1
Bought it because I had been suggested a witch hazel for toning after cleansing. The witch hazel dried my face. Finally got my skin back to standards and this dried my face even MORE than the witch hazel. Rated 2 stars because of the scent (smells delicious) and because it's suggested you use it in your hair as well. I might try it but am not sure yet.,0
not as advertised,0
"Very nice base coat that I've been wearing without polish! Good staying power, although it does tend to ""yellow"" after a few days. Look forward to using it with my new OPI polish to see how it works with a less expensive nail polish that those offered by Butter London.",1
I have used Nioxin for over 10 years.  If your looking for a product that leaves your scalp feeling clean then look no further.,1
I've been using this cream for over a month and see some improvement,1
Item was okay.,1
"I'm 33 and purchased this product to hep with dark circles. I use it religiously morning and evening, but other than being an excellent moisturizer for the eye area, it did not help with the dark circles or any puffiness. I will not be purchasing this product again.  I suggest Philosophy 'Time in a Bottle for Eyes' as an alternate. I have been using the Philosophy product for 9 days, and it has made improvements since day 2.",0
"Havn't had a chance to use often, but don't need much to apply to my hair I know it will go a long way...",1
"This is a very nice color for me. I found it at my local nail salon; it had been left by a previous client, but I did not want to try it until I had same at home for touch up. Does leave a pink residue on nails; had to be buffed off, but otherwise, fine.",1
"Can't be without this....I usually wear acrylic nails, but I decided to take them off.  I had been using
OPI Nail Polish Original Nail Envy on top of my acrylic nails, and my nail bed is healthier than if I had not used it.  Try it, you will not be disappointed.",1
Not good. It started with a small to at the seam and tore all the way down the side in just a few uses.,0
"I can't believe I paid nearly $40 for this tiny thing.

I bought this in the hopes it would cover the awful bug bite scars I have on my leg from a trip to Puerto Rico.

Nope. Doesn't cover them at all...

and this is supposed to cover tattooos? Really? I don't think so.",0
The flat iron by Babyliss works great! My daughter uses it everyday. It heats up quickly and she's ready in minutes.,1
Nice razor but I am adjusting slowly to it - have to be careful.,1
"I have been using it for a few months now. I like how it has sunscreen and applies very easily. I feel that I protects my face from the elements. I work outside everyday and use this product everyday. I would put this on par with or just better than Jack Blacks Men's SPF Moisturizer. It has an initial smell when it is applied but quickly goes away. It's a little expensive, but I've been told that if you buy products for your face you should spend your money on good moisturizers; I would purchase the product again. It also comes in an awesome container.",1
My hair dresser used this on me and I went 3 days without washing my hair. That's a miracle so I ordered some from Amazon even though its expensive for dry shampoo. The paste I received actually makes my hair oily immediately. I wash my hands before applying it so it's not the oil from my fingers. You can actually see a shiny film on my fingers after spreading it in my hand. I've tried wiping that film off before applying to my hair but it still makes my hair look dirtier than before (I do this on one day old hair.) I wonder if they sell lower quality batches to Amazon.,0
"Maybe I'm incompetent, but I could not make this thing do anything except spin around at high temperatures in a terrifying fashion",0
"Very pretty lilac nail color. Went on smooth, in my picture just one coat! On top, I used Seche quick dry top coat.",1
"I love the flavor of this, and while it's a bit pricy for a balm it really does last for ages. It's got a nice shine, and it leaves my lips feeling super hydrated.",1
Soothing cream for my recent eye surgery.,1
Very awkward in the mouth due to thick neck and handle portion of the brush...actually clashes with your teeth,0
Makes the spot you are covering look dry and dull.  Not a natural look. I will not buy this again.,0
"After reading tons of reviews, I bought the Luna 2 as a replacement for my Clarisonic Mia. What a mistake. It was very difficult to get the brush/cleanser part of the device into smaller areas of my face (sides of nose, next to and under eyes) and I ended up breaking out a ton as a result.  This went back to Amazon quite quickly and my Clarisonic was returned to its rightful place in my skincare routine.",0
"Oribe is speedy fancy hair stuff but it really is worth it.  Works wonderfully and I have really annoying hair, so when something works, I spend the $$ for it.  The whole line is superior quality and if you have the money and problematic hair like mine this stuff will work very well to help you.",1
not sure if product is doing anything :-(,0
It is a great product with some sun protection.,1
Works great at keeping ph and moisture at balanced levels throughout the day into night.,1
Essie is my favorite polish ....... love all the different colors.,1
"Second time I used it, the spray came out in white globs as if the liquid had coagulated inside the can.",0
"This polish was not the color it appears to be. It is more of a purpley skin tone, as opposed to a pink. Otherwise, it seemed ok, tho it chips easily.",0
Very happy with this hairspray. Has a good hold without being too stiff or crunchy and has a good smell. Currently growing out my hair and the akward stage it is at requires a lot of baby pins and hair spray and this spray has a good staying power throughout the day.,1
"EltaMD makes a great sunscreen. It is gentle on my skin, which is very sensitive.",1
"I bought this in hopes that I could paint my nails clear and have them look wet and shiney. Well this little product left them pretty dull and this chips pretty easily. Let me explain. When you paint your nail with this, it dries very thin, so thin that it chips very easily. So please, don't wast your money with this. There are better clear polishes, i would recommend Essie's clear nail polish.",0
Love the candle ,1
Not impressed. No noticeable new hair growth.,0
Product had different texture than product bought in the store. Writing on product was not english.,0
My Dr's office charges $20 more for this.  I have tried all the over the counter products but they always felt greasy or didn't protect that well from the sun.  This product is great!  This product leaves my skin feeling soft and non greasy.  Even after 10 hours at work my skin still feels great.  Works well under makeup also.  I am in the sun a lot and Elta MD protects my skin better than anything else.  The tinted is also great for days you don't feel like wearing makeup.  Tossed all my other products.,1
It makes my hair sticky.,0
I feel like I cannot get the powder out and almost feel like I am grey now,0
"There is a silver-lining to this story, so keep reading....

Amazing matte texture but not for everyone. I've tried a great many sunblocks (I have sensitive skin, prefer natural products) in the last 12 months and finally landed on the Tizo brand. This Tizo 3 Mineral sunscreen is spectacular in a lot of ways - the mousse lightweight texture is pretty amazing - like they found a way to make ""whipped Titanium Dioxide"". However, it is still ""Titanium Dioxide"" based and, for whatever reason, this seems to go deep within my pores and get nice in cozy -- resulting in an ""enlarged pore"" appearance on my face after about an hour of wearing it.

As I mentioned, there's a silver-lining and for me it was that I realized my Esthetician carried Tizo products and was surprised by my experience with Tizo sunscreen and hypothesized that it was due to the formula being a bit ""too fine"" as to settle into pores. She gave me some free samples of another Tizo sunscreen ""TIZO Ultra Zinc Body & Face Sunscreen Tinted SPF 40"" and I've tried it for the last two days and LOVED IT. It goes on and it's invisible - plus it doesn't give me enlarged pores.

As soon as the ""TIZO Ultra Zinc Body & Face Sunscreen Tinted SPF 40"" arrives from Amazon, I look forward to writing a glowing 5-star review!",0
"This is a great moisturizer, but I wish the tanning was a little deeper.  Especially with washing my face twice a day, it doesn't have a chance to build up any color.  There's very slight color, but it seemed to slightly emphasize my sun tan and now that that's gone, I don't notice much of a change.",1
leaked on delivery. Has a strange shape/ european cap ...hard to get the product out & no pump fits.,0
Way too clumpy and lashes are not as long as I expected. Disappointed after reading all the good reviews.,0
"Works great; nice smell, too.  Wish it wasn't so pricey.  Still, this was the cheapest place I could find it after WEEKS of checking various online and brick-and-mortar stores.  If you love Pureology, this is the place to get it.",1
"I've been using the Glycolix pads for over a month now. I have yet to see any difference at all in my skin tone or texture. I was so hoping these would give my middle aged skin a boost of radiance, but nothing. I am super disappointed.",0
nice design,1
I should've looked further into how much product would be coming with this item. There was no plastic covering and the surface had a dent so who knows if this was even brand new. For 26.00 it was not worth it. It's pretty ridiculous actually.,0
"This product is OK at best. Received as a gift after reading lots of positive reviews. The smell is nice and the plastic bowl is convenient. The big problem is residue and lack of lubrication. I have a water softener and I still get lots of residue on my razor, in my sink, anywhere this soap touches. I have used other shaving soaps and never experienced this amount of residue. It does come off with any bathroom cleaner/soap scum remover, but what a hassle. The second issue is that it is not very lubricating. It pulls badly even with a fresh blade. It is like shaving with cheap bar soap. I will definitely try something else next time",0
"I went into this purchase with high hopes of a wonder compact and at first it was ... until it wasn't :(
The color was fine and I appreciated the sun protection, it applied well in the beginning and then became thick, cakey and difficult to apply. Instead of retaining a smooth cream product texture it lost that. I'm VERY careful with my products and they are never left open, exposed to sunlight and never exposed to heat of the day. ALSO I used it ONLY 4 times and then it became thick.
I do not have dry skin and it looks cakey and It looks horrible on, adding moisturizers doesn't help.
I'm very disappointed and cannot recommend.",0
"Can't live without this product! Ihave thick long curly hair and use it after every ahower. Makes my hai soft and healthy, detangles it, and keeps it shiny but not weighted down. Delivered on time.",1
"My hair is very fine and smooth, almost too smooth to ever style in any way that stays. I always love how my hair feels after a day at the beach, and somehow this product captures that moveable texture, making my hair seem thicker and wavier. It adds just enough texture without adding grease too. It smells alright - more fake fruity/soapy than salty beach though. You do have to blow dry your hair as instructed for the full effect too. Air dry does very little.",1
I love the SURFACE AWAKEN line. It is the only hair product I use now.,1
"This is a good mascara. The applicator is a narrow wand, which I find works better than the fat ones.  I rarely get smudges on my browbone with this, and I often do with other mascaras.  Doesn't crumble and fall, either.  About equal in volumizing and lengthening.  I haven't found a better mascara.",1
"I have been using Elemis Eye Revewal Cream for a while.  It is very expensive, but doesn't last long--maybe a month using it sparingly.  I used only one bead of product at a time.  Just can see paying so much for so little product.",1
The smell is medicinal and it doesn't last very long. It also irritated my skin and burned when I used it-- like when you put perfumed lotion on your legs after you just shaved. I also did not notice any heat. Other scrubs take way more dead skin off than this.,0
I wouldn't recommend for use with multiple blade razors.  Found shaving with this very rough on my face.  Thought this would be a good alternative to a travel shaving gel - I'll have to keep looking.,0
"I did not receive the dropper in the package, and one of the polishes did not have a brush inside.",0
Nice scent but doesn't last more than a few hours.,1
Did not work and was all spilled out in the bag the bottle didn't even have the lid on it at all,0
"Great volume, but you loss shine and manageability -- that said, I still love the volume I get, I just have to work with my hair a little more to style it. The volume achieved it very noticable but I don't feel or see any long term damage at all.",1
Love this stuff!  Not too sticky or heavy.,0
Does not fit the end of my Solano 3500Lite. Instantly falls off. SOOOO disappointed. Unable to return since outside the return period. Who knew that I should have tested to make sure a Solano product actually fit on another Solano product as advertised?!?!? What is it that they say about assuming?...,0
The perfume smell is way too strong,0
"I have tested this product for about two weeks now and I haven't seen any drastic change. I have used this in addition with my normal skin care routine and my combination complextion does have slight uneven texture from the lack of good skincare routine in my teens, but this product has no produced any visible changes to me, yet. I'll continue using this because it does have a nice light/normal consistency with UV protection and it is paraben free. Paraben free is one of the top necessary requirements for me and I will continue using this product. I will update back when the whole bottle is gone. Thankfully it has not caused any adverse reactions and it does not sting my eyes, so I would definitely keep using this product, especially since it touts antiaging properties. It can't hurt, right?

My normal skin case routine is cleansing, exfoliatilm a few times a week, and moisturizer and eye cream at night. In the morning, I cleanse, toner, moisturizer, primer and then my normal makeup routine.",1
"Okay but given the long time it lasts, invest in a more up-market brand like Taylor of Old Bond Street. Better lather and more interesting fragrances.  The container is a bit small making it harder to lather with the current product.",0
"It's okay.  I think overpriced for the product.  I have used it now well over a month...not sure it is any better than regular department store, less priced conditioners.  Don't plan for  a second purchase. :-/",1
"I love this product, but there were some issues with it this time.  There were several empty packets and dry pads inside the packet.  So, it was a little disappointing.  I think I will purchase direct from Ulta at the store next time.",0
"This scrub is similar to the consistency of a body/facial scrub. I was unfortunately misled by some of the raving reviews. It simply isn't fine enough, the scrub is too heavy and thick to do a proper job. Did not work for me dispite smelling really yummy. Too bad I'd really like something that works for the approaching winter weather.",0
"I've had this nail strengthener for about 2 months time, and yes - the reviews are correct, it really is a superb nail product. My nails were really strung out after having gel-coated nails for the past 5 years or so. Did not have time for monthly nail-technician visits so grew my gel-covered nails out and started using Nail Envy. My nails more sturdy than ever, even when I accidentally bump my hand somewhere, my nails stay intact, whereas, before using nail envy - they were sure to break, chip, tear.

This is how I used it:
- put 2 coats on clean nails
- one coat daily for 7 days
- removed everything on day 7
- rubbed olive oil on my nails/cuticles on day 7

Repeated the cycle for a second week.

Now I use it as a top coat.",1
"I ordered OPI red, I gave it 2 stars because it did come within the time range it said it would however it's not red, it's more of a dark pink.",0
Love it!,1
"Great product! I would buy again. I really liked the ""that's incredi-peel"". I could tell a difference in the fine lines on my face and felt my skin was firmer overall. This product did make face red and dry. I tend to be more sensitive than the average person, so I just used the peels once a week. I still feel like I got a great result and spacing the use out really helped my sensitive skin. I would give the peels 5 stars. The other included products worked as advertised, but didn't feel like anything special to me.",1
Beautiful long lasting color.,1
"I bought this from Ulta and am glad I saw it on here and for the exact same price because I'm definitely going to purchase this product again. It has worked for both my husband and I. He has sensitive skin but we both have normal to oily skin and get breakouts every once in a while. I've been using it for almost 5 months now and learned that it works best for me when I apply it immediately after I see a pimple appearing. It works on red bumps, and white heads however, I've had to get rid of the pus in the pimple (if any) to get it to dry the pimple out completely. I always applied it at night before bed and washed it off in the morning. It is really light and never wiped off on my bedsheets because once dried, it kind of 'sticks' to the skin until you rub it off.
Love this stuff! Super easy to use.",1
I've used the original blinc mascara and loved but was looking for a buildable product so I gave this one a try. When layering it looks spidery and does flake off. I'm going back to the original product.,0
Great product. Easy purchase from Amazon,1
Bought it because I read somewhere it works like pureology power dressing. Similar but not as good. I still would buy again though.,1
"Love this stain. Layer it on for very sheer, natural looking pink lips.  Add a balm once dried & your good to go.  I get lots of compliments on how light & natural this looks",1
"This stuff is awesome. Goes on easy (or have your partner put it where you need it) and hides my stupid bald spot.
Best money you will spend today for sure.",1
"This product is good, it smells good, however, the ingredients should be stated boldly out front on the label, this has aluminum. It lasts throughout the day. It should be stated: Antiperspirant deodorant so everyone would know it has aluminum in it, I would not have purchased it, aluminum is not healthy for our brain. All in all it smells great and lasts all day.",1
"It's totally fake! Don't buy, it's smelly after you put the oil on hair, the smell is totally different from the product I brought from the official website before.",0
Used it for years.,1
the Best!,1
"It left a horrible residue on my hair. The first couple washes I thought maybe I hadn't rinsed all the way so I continued to use it but nope, it was definitely the product.",0
"Stuff works fantastic. Alongside the Gel, my face and scalp had near instantaneous positive results. I bought a dozen more for stock.",1
"a miracle!  Covers my bald spot in the back.  Had to get a darker shade though, but gave the other to my husband.",1
"I bought this for my husband to use with his straight razor and disposable razor for daily shaves. He complained that it was sticky and didn't allow for the blade to glide across his face and neck. He is back to his Shave Secret.
The smell of the product is pleasant and seems like a great value. Now I will be using Elegance Plus on my legs and will update this review.",0
I have used this for years and I love it! It keeps my face moisturized and protected from the sun.,1
"I got this treatment done at a salon professionally (don't remember the exact steps wait 5 minutes, plastic cap, under a HOT dryer etc.) and I was sent home with a 15 ml sample to use. Problem...""Wheat Amino Acid"" and I have a wheat intolerance/allergy. I have not felt well ALL day. Very dissapointed.",0
Wife is a professional hairdresser and asked me to reorder this exact model after the last one died after hundreds of clients over a year and a half. That's enough proof of the usefulness and the effectiveness in my view!!,1
"This product is always good for me. It suits me best than ever. But once you started using it, then you can't stop.",1
"Beautiful long lasting enamel
Love it",1
Highly recommend- use it daily....great moisture and sunscreen... won't leave home without applying.  use it as a foundation so saves me money on makeup.,1
"Whatever the make up of this product is, it does not feel like a 20% glycolic acid and there were zero results after using up the whole tub. And I used it daily. Waste of money.",0
Good polish,1
"Love my CND Shellac, but this is the ugliest color I have ever purchased ( I wasted my money on this one).  The bottle is a pretty bright yellow, but the color is actually more of a burnt mustard.  My husband has always loved my nails but this one he kept saying take it off!  It was disturbing it was so ugly.",0
"Really disappointed with this colour. It lacks something. While the tone is ok, it needs a bit of depth. It's very flat, almost like using a marker to paint your nails. A hit of shimmer I feel would have lifted it a lot. It's very flat and I really dislike wearing it.",0
I'm not sure how moisturizing it might have ended up being because I only used it once or twice.  Did not care for the scent at all.  Ended up throwing it away instead of passing it on to someone else because I couldn't find anyone who liked the way it smelled.,0
dont use it with other face products! it will make your face break out even more and then it will be very dry.,1
product as described. No issue with delivery!,1
"I have very sensitive skin and this is perfect for me. Not too hydrating to give me break outs. It's light, not greasy or heavy yet it diminishes my nose to mouth wrinkles.",1
Works well but pricy.,1
I really love this spray it is great for setting makeup which is what I use it for but sometimes it gets a little bit tacky if you use too much which I do. Lol. But if used sparingly it looks very nice. I am only giving four stars because I find the heritage rose water better for setting my makeup and looking dewy but this is also a great choice.,1
"arrived all dried up, but was easily returned for my money back",0
"First I must say I am writing this review for all of my girl friends. I have been used Strivectin eye cream for 3 years, since age 39. You can get a sample at Sephora, just ask and they will make one for you. This is how I first tried it. As for being expensive - Bull- you get OVER an  1 ounce of product for 59.00, almost ALL eye creams are for .50, half an ounce! This cream is amazing, I put it on my friends, just one eye and not the other and their jaws drop! It takes care of puffiness, dark circles, fine lines and wrinkles. Now, if you have abused your skin and you have MAJOR wrinkles, I don't know if anything on the market can help, be realistic....
I only use mine in the morning when I really need it, lasts all day and one tube usually lasts me over a year. The only place I use it, is under and around my eyes not my whloe face. I have not tried the other products, but I am sure they are just as amazing.",1
Love this mascara! Extends lashes and no smudging.,1
"I was in Israel and tried a sample at the Dead Sea. My ""old, tired"" skin is always dry and flaking but this cures it immediately and it smells so fresh too. You can't beat the price here on Amazon.",1
"I don't like the polish because it ""falls off"" very easily.  It doesn't stay on well nor is it durable.",0
"I bet it helped a lot of people with their hair, but for me it did the opposite. I got major hair loss from using it only 3 times. My hair texture changed into a weird texture... like a wig texture. I regret spending so much money for a product that literally ruined my hair.",0
I didn't notice any difference will not try again,0
Doesn't leave a smooth finish. There are better products out there,0
Not worth the money!!!  Wow was I surprised when I opened my package of lotion! The tube was so small it was ridiculous. My bad for not looking at the ounce size. Definitely a rip off for the price!!!,0
"I have acne scars on my chin, and have done hours of research on ways to fade these ugly red marks without going as far as laser treatment. I found this product in a Refinery29 review of ""products people can't live without"". The reviews were amazing, this stuff sounds like miracle gel. Better skin, acne scars begone, blackhead vanishing.

I am soooooo disappointed to not have any of these said miracles happen. I have used it 3 times a week and it doesn't do a damn thing. My face doesn't tingle, no redness afterwards. Essentially I sit with some nice cool jelly on my face for 10 minutes, rinse it off and voila. Presto! Nothing changed. Maybe buying on Amazon isn't coming direct from the producer, perhaps it expired or something?

I regret purchasing a $45 jar of goop. I could go to the store and get organic raspberry jam for like, $6 to smother all over my face... it would definitely smell better.",0
"No sculpting or shine, in fact I don't think it did anything. I can control my fly away better with a leave in conditioner or oil.",0
Nice color!,1
I love this product!!,1
Best product for fine hair. Lifts without making my hair look like a helmet,1
Very good.  Quick service.  thank you.,0
This has some kind of different formula to it because my hair isn't the same as the salon purchase. This is a Knockoff and not worth the money.,0
"I just love the Mason Person Brush!  I have used Mason Pearson Brushes for years, and they are just wonderful!",1
Cleared up my babies acne in 2 days! Amazing!,1
"This is the CHEAPEST HotTools product I've ever seen. When it arrived, it would only work on the high setting (while fluctuating between hot and cool). If I put it on the low setting, it would turn bright red inside and not blow any air (SCARY!). Ultimately, it stopped working all together after getting very hot and smelling like it was melting. Do not buy this product!
Fortunately, Amazon was very good about refunding me and there wasn't any issue on that end.",0
"It's a little streaky/thicker when applying, color is nice.",1
"This brush is horrible, I bought it after my denman handle broke and I liked the fact that it was made out of wood.
But the bristles are hard and not even in size so they rip your hair rather than smooth it out. Unless there is some way to soften to bristles I would not bother purchasing it. It is made in the same way as the Sibel 74 but costs 6 times the price and that was an awful brush.

Save your money and buy a denman instead",0
"love this, and always buy it, but it came to me unsealed, and crusty around the top when i opened it. not happy with that, someone had obviously opened it up before me.",1
i have been using this for about one month now on top of the elta md face cleanser and between the 2 my face is soo dry and peeling and i am breaking out soooo bad!  this product was highly recommended by my dermatologist and i am very disappointed they are not performing well,0
"Love it!  Quick shipping, great price.  Thanks.  A+++++",1
nice but a bit dull,1
I bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday present. I definitely see and feel a difference. His beard is softer and looks smoother. The soft side of the brush flattens a lot of flyaways. The only complaint I have is the other side of the brush is too rough.,1
"I got this in a kit I bought from Lorac, and I wasn't blown away.  It's not a bad mascara, but it's far from the best I own and not as good as I've come to expect from Lorac.  It's acceptable, which is not really what one wants in their makeup purchases.  I used it 3 times, and each time it took forever to dry so I'd get little black flecks of transfer on my lids/under eye area, a problem I don't have with other mascaras.  I also noticed I had a fair amount of darkness under my eye after wearing it all day which was probably from the mascara, or because overall it's hard to get it all off at night.  Aside from the drying and transfer problems it just didn't have any ""wow"" factor that made the downsides worth it, and the only positives are it didn't clump up and I really liked the shape of the wand.  If I'm going to wear a hard to remove mascara I'd reach for Dior or Lancome which actually has made people stop and comment on my eyelashes.  Alas, even though I adore Lorac, this product isn't one I can recommend.",0
Bad,0
"Beautiful coverage.
Love all of the LaRoche- products.
Never disappointed.
Blends smoothly and only uses a very small amount for a superior coverage, the tint matches the description given.
I am very pleased with the Teint Hydrating liquid.
Recommend",1
"The Beat is my all time favorite fragrance, hands down.

So why the one star? Because simply, I don't believe this to have the Burberry quality.

1. The bottle. The tag that is attached to it should be actual leather or a leather-like material, but the product I received is cheaply made with a plastic-like tag and poorly-traced ink designs on the bottle.

But, I can deal with that... so long as the actual perfume meets the standard of the authentic one.

2. It does NOT spray like the authentic Burberry bottles.  That misty spray that you get from high-quality designer perfumes? Yeah, not going to find that here. Instead it rigidly sprays out so you're left with one heavy spot of perfume.

3.  The scent is extremely weak and lacks the true Beat scent, if you're familiar with it.

Note that this is the Eau de Toilette, not the Eau de Parfume.  The Eau de Parfume is more concentrated, so naturally this product is bound to be on the weaker side... but I wasn't expecting it to be so weak.",0
"i have oily skin and the red spots were killing me, i tried so many products until a pharmacist advised me with La roche posay fluid and it works, non oily and light texture... if you have oily skin then give this one a try.",1
Great facewash.. perfect exfoliation for every day use. The bottle came damaged and customer service gave me a discount. Probably purchase in person once I run out.,1
It's one the best I've had,1
I thought I would give a different product a try and this was not for me.  It made my hair feel stringy and even more thin than it was when I started using it. I used this product for over 4 months and didn't see any difference. If not it was worse.  I ended up going back to Nioxin and noticed a difference within a week.,0
Smells amazing!,1
"Since using this product I have come to a sad realisation.  It is nowhere near as good as the old Xtah Crude Clay, not for people with hair like mine.  The old Xtah Crude Clay was a revelation.  After years of searching I couldn't find anything and then Xtah Crude came along.  I loved my hair after that.  Now it is always limp.

I am staggered they discontinued such a fantastic product.

Can anyone help me with a possible proper alternative or anywhere I can buy the old stuff?",0
Gets hot quickly and stays hot.  Works great on thick hair!!,1
"I ordered this palette it's came broken and the shadow sparse all over the palette, but I used it anyway. I'm very disappointed.",0
It doesn't dry my hair which is a major plus! Most hair perfume are extremely drying!,1
Only hair product that can hold my stubborn Asian hair,1
I never could get the polish remover into the pen; a Qtip dipped in polish remover works just as well!,0
"I love the smell, and it helps to clear up my skin nicely. A little drying, though.",1
"I was expecting better coverage from this item since it is advertised as a ""4 in 1,"" but it's basically just a very chalky pressed powder.",0
"I have very hard water, and have been told to use a clarifying shampoo a few times a week to reduce build up on my hair. I also have colored treated hair, so I was excited to find Pureology has a line of clarifying shampoo. I did not notice a huge difference in my hair after using this, unfortunately.",1
"Love it, just expensive.",1
Favorite gel polish.  I will buy more.,1
Works well,1
The product package was opened.,0
"Men's colognes often fall into one of two categories: musky or fruity. Neither of these appeal to me. Boucheron, though, is a clean, sophisticated scent.",1
"When I opened the package, it looked like the product was previously returned or used. Not completely sure. Tried the product this morning... Appears to be working correctly. Very much like the size and weight of this Torino model than the Portifino model. More lightweight.",1
I do not use hair products often I really hate them actually but when I need too this stuff works well. It gives a good hold and is not itchy. A little goes a very long way.,1
"i thought it was navy blue, it is purple.",0
Went totally dead after 5 months! Just wouldn't turn on.,0
Worked well for a weekend weeding.,1
"The bottle cap is not fixed.
It was badly delayed.
2/3 of the oil has leaked into the box with other purchases.
As for the liquid - it is beautiful!",0
Makes your hair tangly and doesn't really steve a purpose. Very disappointed,0
Really good coverage. I think it's best if you apply and let it dry and then apply more. It was a little too oily for my skin and caused some breakouts.,1
"This product is effective. Leaves hair thick. Only problem is that after 24 hrs, hair becomes a bit oily.",1
Not even 4 months in the flat iron stopped heating up,0
"I was hesitant because I have never spent so much money on a blow dryer. This is worth every penny. My hair used to take 25 min to totally dry, I am now dry in less than 10min. My hair is smoother and shiny. I don't even have to straighten it as much as much.",1
"I tried this after really enjoying and seeing results with many Anthony Logistic products. I have fairly oily skin on my nose & middle brow. After twice daily use for about 3 days it turned my skin into dry, flaky, super tight feeling and irritated. As someone who doesn't normally experience skin side effects from anything dermatological I can say that this is highly irregular.

However, (without yet testing) I could say that this product may be good for intermittent use of treating skin that has become out of control. Maybe once a week to help with tone & balance regulation (again, assumed).

Went back to the normal white A.L. cleanser and skin quickly revived.",0
"I've been using the Bahama Mama for years now, they recently changed the formula and I'm not a fan of it. The undertone is very red and it's super powdery. When I applied it on, my skin just looks blotchy! It's such a shame because I really loved this bronzer, it was the OG bronzer, now no one even talks about it. The original formulation was very smooth, there was no fallout, and the undertone was yellow but taupe enough to contour with. The new formula works as a bronzer but as a long time user, it's just not the same. I am v upset and v sad. Now I have to find a new bronzer.",0
"I searched for a long time to find a facial scrub that worked well on skin with stubble and didn't leave an after scent.  A friend recommended Baxter of California and I've been hooked ever since.

First off, if you have sensitive skin I don't think this product would be right for you.  At times it can feel like rubbing sand mixed with shards of glass all over your face.  However, that may be what makes it so effective.  After using it I feel like I've taken not only the dead skin off, but probably a few extra layers as well.  This is great if you have a beard or stubble since other facial scrubs don't seem to penetrate beneath the hairs.  It leaves your face feeling refreshed and skin feeling smooth.  It also seems to help with in grown hairs after shaving.

I would recommend using it only once or twice a week.  More than that and you run the risk of scrubbing your face off.  You would also be wasting a very expensive product.  At $17 its not cheap, but in this case a little goes a long way.  I use a pea drop sized amount once a week in the shower.  It also pairs well with Baxter of California face wash to help cleanse the skin you just scraped clean.

I would highly recommend this product.",1
Good sunscreen! Nice feeling!,1
Credit for sample box can only be used to purchase full sized versions of the sample.  The system is confusing to me and not a good value.,0
"It's an awesome product.  It leaves my hair light and not oily.  I recommend it. If you're looking for something that is relatively inexpensive and effective for dry, damaged hair then this is it.",1
I love the smooth even color on my nail.,1
"I have used this eye concentrate intermittently now for a month or more and feel that it has helped reduce some of the less attractive age related appearances of my skin. It's nice to wear under makeup, especially, and I've used it before bedtime as well. I do feel that it can be slightly irritating to my often dry, sensitive eyes, so I don't use it all the time.

It doesn't take much product when just using around the eye area so this small tube lasts quite a while. It is quite expensive for my budget so I doubt that I'll repurchase it unless I'm more impressed as I continue to use it. I don't believe that it's a permanent solution to wrinkles and darkened areas, but it does make them less obvious to the ""beholder"", so that value may be more important to others than to me, at this point in my life.",1
"I wear extra large gloves and this razor is small in my hands, the handle is comparable in size to  an average tube of chapstick.
i was going to return it becuase of this and order the long handle version, but after a test shave  i found it just to good to send back,  it glides acroos my face easily  and  removed my thick stubble. the included merkur  blade did an acceptable job as well.",1
"I enjoy using this cleanser.  It's for Babies, and I found it using an app called Skin Deep, which rates cosmetic products by how many dangerous chemicals they contain.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and nice and I'm happy with it.  I've tried many products and I don't know how many facial cleansers I've thrown away.  This one is a keeper.",1
This exfoliator is great.,1
Pretty,1
"I was looking for a great alternative shampoo to brighten my natural light blonde hair (Nordic heritage) and my hair gets that ugly brassy yellow tone. This shampoo did not take away the brassiness, but definitely made a darkish purple tone. If you want to have purple tone hair, this is a great product! If you want to brighten your silver or blonde hair, look elsewhere. I gave two stars because it didn't dry out my hair like some clarifying/brightening shampoos.",0
"it works for me. However, it will take some time to recover.",1
great face wash very soothing will buy again,1
"This product is frustrating at best.  After having used the Christian Dior heated eyelash curler - nothing compares! I can only hope that they will start selling it again.  As for this one, its going in the garbage.",0
Really happy with this foundation. Good coverage and very comfortable to wear . Great every day foundation.,1
"This is gray, not gray green, just gray. Not as described or pictured. Not eligible for return. Buyer beware.",0
This is a review of the packaging which was awful. Just recieved and this conditioner was spilled all over the place. Severly disappointed.,0
Nice matte finish.  Doesn't have the greasy bluish tinge of many other facial sunscreens.,1
"This is a very nice gift package of baby lotion, shampoo and more, made with all natural ingredients and no chemical additives. This is so important nowadays with so many of our ""health and beauty"" products that contain cancer-causing ingredients, that have been removed from many other products but were ""grandfathered in"" by the FDA for some unknown reason. We especially want to protect newborns and babies, as our skin is also an organ. Anything damaging or dangerous goes straight into the rest of our body and causes prolonged harm. These products are dermatology tested to be free from anything not natural so are very good for babies skin.

The products are plant-based, with Avocado Perseose, a ""patented natural ingredient to help protect and hydrate a baby's delicate skin."" They are Paraben, Phthalate and Phenoxyethanol free, and hypoallergenic.

It's a very nice gift set for any newborn and mother. Recommended.",1
I like it,1
Color was almost peach and not what expected.,0
"Like most women purchasing this product I have fair skin. I initially tested my stomach area and left it for 1.5 hours, my tan was barely noticeable. The next time I applied the mouse all over my body I left it on for 2.5 hours. The bottle says that 3 hours will give you a deep tan. And my tan was not deep at all, it was natural-looking and lightly bronzed. My husband still barely noticed the tan until I showed him a portion of skin that I did not use the product on. So for fair skinned girls I would say don't worry about leaving it beyond 2 hours, but again, test the product on a small area first.

The other point that I'd like to mention is that prior to using the mousse, my arms were already pretty tan--unlike the rest of my body. I didn't want to tan my arms because I didn't want them to get even darker than the rest of my body. So I actually skipped tanning my arms and just blended the product in on my upper arms where my natural tan slowly disappeared. I was a little nervous about doing this but the result was great. The tan blended incredibly well with my natural tan and the rest of my body was the same shade as my darker arms which I was pleased about.

Lastly, the first time I used the product for a test area I wore a mask (this was the first time I had ever used a tanning mousse). However, the second time I applied the product I forgot the mask and ended up with a massive headache for several hours. The product doesn't smell bad, but i would recommend covering up your nose and mouth especially if this is your first time using a self tanning product.",1
"I bought this nail product based on the positive reviews. In the beginning I clearly saw an improvement in the way the polish looked and the condition of my nails. I had been using Nailtiques #2 for yrs and it began making my nails peel. This is a great product however for the money it should not change consistency so quickly. After using only 1/4 of the product it began to thicken and just generally become a thick mess. This is not what I would expect or hope for in a product for $19.00.

I would not recommend this product unless you are not unhappy about the prospect of throwing half or more of it away.",0
"Wife likes this a lot... it's slightly darker than her normal foundation shade.  But, it gave her a warmer glow, if you will, which is perfect on those gloomy fall days here in NYS.

It lives up to its claim of velvet touch.  I like the way it looks on her.  I'm too dumb with these things to know if this is priced well or not.",1
"Smells great, holds strong. As a guy with thick Asian hair, it's hard to find gel that works well with my hair. But like other reviewers, the squeezer gets clogged and arrived cracked...otherwise I'd give this 5 stars.",1
I gave this as a gift and she loved it!,1
"I love this cleanser. I use it daily and it is not too strong for me. However, I do not like how it is packaged. When I use it for traveling, it always spills out and all over my other products... Disappointing packaging but good product overall.",1
It's pricey but works well,1
"The box reads:
1.  Contains Formaldehyde.
2.  Avoid contact with skin...may cause skin sensitization.
3.  Protect cuticles with grease or oil.
I tried to return the product but was informed that I can't because it requires special shipping.  It arrived via USPS in a standard padded envelope.  What special handling?
This is fingernail strengthener to be painted on the fingernails but I am required to protect my skin and my cuticles!

2 weeks later I reduced my rating to the lowest possible.  I used this stuff as instructed.  After two weeks three of my nails have split at the quick.  I bought this stuff to strengthen my nails for classical guitar playing.  I am now about to lose my right thumb nail which has split at both sides and is moving towards the center.  I am no longer unhappy, I am angry.",0
"I have combination skin with an oily T zone. This moisturizer works to perfection on my face. First of all, I love that it has a non-greasy, matte finish. Additionally, it balances out my oily T zone against the non-oily parts of my skin, leaving my skin looking balanced (an overall matte look). I still have to blot oil off my face during the day but it's not as much.",1
"Good product. Warm tone is a bit ""bronze"" but good for summer on medium tone skin. I squeeze it on the back of my left hand and apply with a brush to get best application. This is the only CC cream I have tried. Used the natural late fall through winter and bought warm to try for spring- summer.",1
"The shipper must have added water before it was shipped.  It has a pleasant smell, but is ~99% water?  Not very satisfied with this as an aftershave.  I expected more from Imperial Barber Products.",0
"I am not great at shaving, so I constantly try new products to see if they help.  I often prefer shaving cream for men, so I wasn't afraid about the fact this was marked as a men's product.

I have never used shaving cream from a tube before.  You squeeze out a small amount, lather it in your hands, and then apply.  The tube looks small, but there's enough to last a decent amount of time.  The lather is nice but not overwhelming, and I got a pretty good shave with it.  This is pricey for shaving cream, but works well.

There is a smell (juniper), but it isn't overpowering.",1
"The other reviewers are too kind. This product leaves your face with a greasy white look. Virtually unusable on the face. I recommend the SPF 15 product which had none of this effect. Must be too much titanium dioxide.

Overall: Unless you want to look like a Geisha, skip this product on your face. For how much it costs, it shouldn't be this dreadful.",0
Very impressed with this product!,1
I would find another product,0
"Mario Badescu is my favorite skin care brand by far. this product works well, but it is very thick, consistency like butter. i just add a little water to it when i use it and then it works just fine.",1
"This product keeps your hair in place all day if you have short layered hair.  I love it.  when it needs refreshing during the day you just ruffle your hair again and restyle with your fingers.  If you are a head sweater or it is humid, it gets sticky.  That is the only con to this product.  I do recommend it highly!",1
"I really prefer a foaming soap (so I can use my brush and involve hot water and soften my beard more) over creams, but I found that this cream is quite wonderful and actually works very well for me. It smells great, goes on easy, is friendly to my sensitive skin, and leaves me feeling refreshed and nifty. It also helps the razor (I use a double-edge) glide over my skin and shave off that terrible beardiness without incident. Good stuff!

(I am also quite sensitive to any weird scents, perfumes, florals, etc., and this does not bother my allergies at all)",1
My son likes this product it actually works for his ingrown hairs. We have tried many things for his face and this one seems to be working well.,1
Its a good foundation but honestly you can get the same coverage from a $10-$20 foundation.  I'm glad I only paid half the price this foundation normally runs ($40).  It also runs out a lot quicker than my other foundations.  Overall I would not recommend because of the expensive price.,0
"It works.  Wished they'd come out with a in between medium and light brown.  Medium is too dark, light makes your hair orangish.",1
"I love this product. however, I threw it away since the bottle was dirty. black on both sides and not sealed. I will not put anything in my hair that looks like that.",0
Love the wallet but the zipper broke for the coins. I haven't even used it for a month :(,0
A great opportunity to try new products that surround a dry shampoo I love.  I now am a fan of the shampoo and under eye gel pads as well -- will likely order those separately when I run out. A happy customer with this anniversary set!,1
"No smell and looks good. But, the tube was almost empty like it had been used.",0
Great!,1
The Ion smooth Iron is wonderful...as expected! You get what you pay for with this product.  A bit on the pricey side but all the way worth it!!,1
This item was sent with the pump already attached. It had popped up and pumped shampoo into the box. I would recommend it be taped down or the pump be separate with a cap on the shampoo bottle until it is ready for use.,0
"I am a big fan of this stuff, it's really nice. Dries quickly. It smelled good when I first got it but after a month it got kinda rank. Kinda price, but I like it.",1
"This is the only mascara I wear.  I keep my under eye hydrated and every mascara I tried smudges within hours.  Due to the fiber techmology, I never get black, under my eyes. It also has really good lengthening and provides fullness. I recommend it to anyone.",1
"It didn't work, couldn't get anything out of the bottle",0
I love the dryer except for the fact that it DIED after 7 months. Went to plug it in one day and the ground fault plug suddenly won't work. Way too much money for something that did not even last. So disappointed. Wish now I had not bought a second as a backup.,0
DIDN'T WORK ON MY NAILS,0
"this product is fake from amazon, do yourself a favor and buy it from costco,
bought it from amazon first used it for 3 months and NO result
then bought one from constco and my stretch marks we reduced in 2 weeks :) amazing product",0
Just not for me..,0
"So expensive and came opened and spelled, how can it be sealed and unscrewed if it's new? Return it",0
"Not only that it did not work for me (50+), it actually considerably worsened the skin condition - it became extremely dry and irritated, pores more visible/larger. There was no tightening effect whatsover. You definitely shall test this before wasting any money on it!",0
"If you haven't used an ""open comb"" design, they are a bit of a challenge.  I cut myself a lot.  I switched back to the Merkur closed comb design.",0
"2 start only because it fits my blow dryer, so I kept it. Be advised that Solano sells 2 different diffusers and the one I received is different than the one pictured and different than the one I wanted. I should have spent the extra money and ordered directly from Solano",0
"This curling iron is very heavy and hard to use. I have straight, fine hair that needs bounce and wave, but this curling iron does not do the job. It is very hard to hold this curling iron AND try to roll the hair and keep it in the clamp. My hair just falls or slips out. Maybe I should have ordered a smaller size. Several times I burnt my fingers when the iron slipped in my hands. I would recommend a smaller and much lighter curling iron for anyone interested in trying these out. I'm very disappointed I wasted my money on this product. I would probably go down to the 1 inch size if I ever decide to get another product similar to this one.",0
I bought three of these candle based on reviews from other Customers.  I love the Diptyque line of candles from John Galliano but the $60.00 cost is prohibitive.  My fault....bought them without smelling them first.  Not a fan of the scent since it came across as more perfume like then previous reviews had stated.  My biggest complaint is that I can't keep the Wickes to lit and have to through them away.,0
"GREAT PRODUCT, MY SECOND TIME PURCHASING THIS ITEM.",1
"Liked for 11 months, then stopped working and will no longer heat up, the return process is rediculous, so a complete waste of money",0
"It stopped working after a week
So disappointing. I waisted a good amount of money on this piece of modern trash, you do have to buy this separate from the main hand held power
I wish I could get my money back",0
"I wasn't sure I liked this at first, but it works for me now. I have curly frizzy hair. First, I flat iron a little bit to calm down my hair, then I use the Curling Tool to straighten with a curl at the ends. It works. The only think I do NOT like about this product is it does not have an automatic shut off. Big mistake. Maybe they will fix it for the next prototype.",1
COUNTERFEIT! I bought this brush in the large and medium. Both handles have broken off after about 15 uses. DO NOT BUY! I should've listened to the other reviews. I'm going to do everything I can to get my money back.,0
"Reuzel makes great men's grooming products. This does have some fragrance to it but it is light, smells like cologne but not strong. Doesn't have that greasy oily smell like other pomades. Great medium hold.",1
"Makes my hair frizzy and course.  $8 dollar conditioner at the store by ""OGX""  called ""Renewing + organ oil of morocco conditioner"" does a much better job at 1/5 the price.  Don't buy this crap.",0
Love the scent. Very cooling at first but you get used to it and after a few days you don't notice it as much. Whips up into a fantastic lather.,1
"I've been using this product for almost a year and have seen an improvement in my skins appearance.  I don't think anything is going to completely make crepe disappear, but this cream/lotion does help.  I'm 58 and have tried many products..  I use the Intensive Body Repair Treatment during cooler months.  I live in Arizona and during summer heat the intensive cream is too heavy.  I use the Hydrating lotion during the warmer months.  It's just the right potion for my skin.  And the nice thing, a little goes a long way.
It leaves my skin supple, moisturized and.feeling great.  The scent is wonderful.
I've never found any oiliness or staining to my clothing, as some have mentioned.  Overall, I think it's a great product.",1
"This brush is not as soft as the one that came with my exfoliator, feel dissapointed",0
"Definitely covers rosacea redness well but the color match was off for me. Also, it wasn't a smooth finish. It brought out every skin imperfection I have. It would be great as a tattoo cover but not a great daily foundation for my rosacea skin.",0
"The contents in the jar I received were more of a balm than a cream.  It had hardend and looked to be old, dried out product.",0
Great product but not much of it.,1
Don't know if I like this product. After researching about dry shampoo's I read that this is one of the best ones so I decided to try it. I applied it on my bangs one day and after some hours my bangs felt a little oily. I'm a little disappointed.,0
"This is a repeat order. I have gray hair and I only use this about once a week and regular shampoo this rest of the week and I get compliments on the color of my hair. I didn't get compliments on the color of my hair before I let it go gray! My hair has a nice amount of shine and life It really does keep the gray from getting dull and yellow. Even though it is a little pricey, I am really glad I tried this shampoo.",1
"It tore up, and I think it should have lasted and not tore up for the money i paid for it. I got this iron in Feb.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paul-Mitchell-Protools-Express-Ion-Smooth-Iron-1-25/dp/B0041TGNCU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paul Mitchell Protools Express Ion Smooth Iron 1.25""</a>2013",0
"I just started doing my own nails after having them done in a salon for over 17 years. I had Acrylic but  decided I needed to try to save a little money - my nail tech, who has been doing my nails for 17 years, was charging me $40 every 2 weeks. My nails always looked fabulous, and I wouldn't let anyone else do my nails, she's that good, but it was time to do my own!
I read lotf of reviews about lots of Gel products and decided to try CND. I'm glad I did - it's a great product. I purchased a UV Light from Amazon and CND's Top & Base Coat, a few colors and was on my way! I used all as instructed and my nails are beautiful! I apply the gel polishes right over my own nails - and they look like they were done in a salon!
I will continue to buy this product and I would definitely recommend!",1
"Great hold but tends to live the hair stiff. Similar hold and application to Layrite Superhold.
Very masculine scent that is not overpowering.",1
"No fresh smell like my original purchase. It has an odor like it might be out of date, but no date on it.",0
Sucks! Broke within a few months..purchased since it had one year warranty but no way to replace or contact seller,0
Autntico. Muy bueno,1
Forgot my razor at my sisters.  Luckily I had been using this for a few weeks under my arms.  Had to wear long pants for a couple days but didn't have to worry about short sleeved shirts!,1
"I don't like this.  i wanted to use it in between washes, but it just makes my hair sticky and i need to wash it sooner than normal wear.",0
"Pretty good product. I can't feel the first four settings and the highest one isn't too bad either. It's only slightly painful really.
 I've had it for only a month and the treated areas already show slower and reduced regrowth.
Non issue really but it makes an annoying beep every time you zap it (which can be a LOT). Not a big deal because it works.",1
Expensive and I love it.  Use 1x per week.,1
Good stuff.  Smells great...and is high quality.  My wife swears by it for our daughters.,1
"waterproof, really!",1
Excellent product,1
"I love the Paul Mitchell tea tree special line.  I love the smell of lavender.  Why not put Paul Mitchell and lavender into my basket and wash my hair?  Alright!  Bad idea.  I'm not impressed.  Unfortunately, this shampoo didn't give that awesome ""clean"" feeling, nor did it smell like lavender.  In fact, my hair still felt dirty and smelled like a wet dog.  It isn't a shampoo I will be trying again.  Think I'll stick with the tea tree special shampoo line.",0
"This is a pleasently scented lightweight lotion for the prevention of newstretch marks and to help reduce the look of existing ones. As a new mom I'm using it for the latter purpose. The cream itself is moisturizing without stickiness or oiliness but it does take awhile to soak in and leave that nice matte feeling. I've been applying it to my stretch marks and while I feel it will be awhile before I know how well it works to fade them it is deeply moisturizing so I can definately see this going a long way towards preventing them.

The breast firming serum is the reason I'm giving this set as a whole four stars rather than five. It's thick and not nearly as pleasent to apply as the cream. It takes so long to soak in that I can only use it when I'm pretty sure I won't be nursing the baby soon. Even then I have to keep on an old shirt after I use it since I'm not comfortable getting it on the inside of my nursing bras. That said, I does seem to have a firming effect. For now I'll be saving it until my little one is older and I don't have to worry so much about timing the application of it.",1
"Ordered this for office use and let me say it is wonderful. So many comment on how good he smells.
I spray it around the office. So wonderful!",1
10x better than a Chi! So happy I made the switch. I haven't had any trouble with the rubber piece everyone talks about - it's not going anywhere if you're somewhat gentle.,1
"I was very excited about the reviews and I like to buy the same line and follow the manufacturer`s instructions, so I bought the shampoo, the conditioner and the leave in. I used them all and my hair is sticky and without movement. I did not approve the purchase, but I will try one more time to make sure I still have to keep trying to find the best products for my curly-fine hair.",0
"I purchased this machine and it worked great for about a month or two... Of course right after the return period expired it stopped working.  Obviously I can't get my money back but I am at least expecting an exchange for a unit that actually works.  I even tried calling the manufacturer, maybe they can repair it? Well good luck at even getting a hold of a human.  I am currently waiting to hear from either the manufacturer or this Amazon seller... I rarely write reviews and wanted all of you to know before you get ripped off!! I  I believe this is great technology but the actual manufacturing (cost's) hasn't caught up with this idea to be beneficial (FDA will only approve a certain amount strength for home users) or reliable enough for home users.",0
Great quality and fast shipping.,1
"Not real. Smell is wrong. It's fine shampoo, but what I got was likely a fake.",0
"It straightens and protects your hair, and smells amazing. I used to love this product until I realized that it doesn't do anything spectacular aside from that. The problem is there are much better products out there. Moroccanoil and Kerastase are two better brands that come to mind. Still, a good straightening serum.",1
"I've tried just about every hair oil on the market and this one is pretty good.  I have lots of fine, straight colored hair prone to frizz, fly-aways, and expansion (you know, when your hair puffs out like a marshmallow in the microwave).  Anyway, this oil definitely makes my hair softer and shinier, but I'm not sure it was that great at smoothing the puff.  Great smell that's pretty light and overall a decent oil...although Moroccan was just as good and smells to die for.",1
"I purchased the 1.5"" model as a Christmas gift thinking that I was getting her a salon quality curling iron that would last a long time.  It quit working after less than 5 months.  The seller offered warranty replacement if we pay return shipping.  But for the cost of shipping we can buy a Revlon curling iron at Walmart.  Her last Revlon lasted much longer than this so-called salon quality curling iron.  Thanks but no thanks!  Do not purchase this curling iron and expect it to last a long time.",0
I was surprised to receive RED nailpolish. This picture is deceiving. I was expecting a pink color. It shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate.,0
My hair is fine and frizzy. This stuff makes my hair soft and smooth. It smells great and doesnt have the common ingredients I try to avoid (parabens etc). The bottle lasts me for months.,1
"OK, I ignored the other reviewers' warnings, expecting that no face product could possibly smell that bad.  I was wrong!  The consistency is also very greasy -- really an ointment.  Some people do swear by the stuff, though.  I'll keep it as a cold weather hand cream.",0
"Poor hair pressure, green sparks
Dont buy it",0
"The picture shown is not correct! ABBA discontinued the Moisture Shampoo Yucca, geranium wild mint and now have a newer one available in the stores. I don't care for it so I was told by Ulta to look on Amazon and when I searched online I ""thought"" I found it. The picture was deceiving because they have the discontinued as the image. However, when I got my shipment in the mail it's the newer one that ABBA has available. I was very disappointed.",0
"I would love to post a review of this product, however I am unable as the product was completely gone when I received it.",0
I did not like the fragrance because I think it overpowers the potion I use after the shave.  I keep trying to findafragrance free product that Amazon Prime covers.,0
"Hair type:medium-thick, wavy, not super dry roots. Product: feels like conditioner. Use a very small amount, then build up as needed. I have fairly frizzy hair (especially in humidity). This is the best frizz tamer I have found, but don't apply too much at once or you'll end up with greasy looking hair. After showering and towel drying, I usually gently dab my fingers into the jar, rub the souffl all over my palms and fingers and lightly run my fingers and palms through my hair, working from ends to roots. After my hair dries, I apply a bit more to tame my hair. When it's not too humid, these two applications are enough to tame the frizz until the next wash. I didn't give it a full five stars because it's still hard to tame some of the baby hairs without adding too much souffl and making them look greasy.",1
"I really like this color, but it is kind of thick, so I don't know if I got an old bottle of if that is the way it is. I don't know how to thin it out a little without ruining it. It just took some time and patience to get it to lay right, and once it did, it looked great!",1
"A review from my wife since this was one of our Vine items and I don't wear makeup or use products of this nature....

A lot of plant based or all natural treatments contain aloe, which Im allergic to.  So I was very glad to see that this treatment for lips didnt.  It does promise a lot, though.  Its supposed to visibly reduce the appearance of vertical lines, smooth, soften, and plump the delicate lip area.  Also, lipstick will glide on beautifully and you can say goodbye to lipstick bleed!

This lip treatment is different than anything Ive ever tried.  Its neither a balm nor a gloss and its not in a tube.  Its a very light cream (the box describes it as delicate) and its in a tiny little jar. It has a very light, very soft feel to it as it goes on.  Unlike practically anything else Ive ever used on my lips, this product absorbs into the lips really quickly.  And while it doesnt leave a waxy or greasy layer on the lips, you definitely know its there  lips are moisturized, soft, and rosy (even though its not tinted at all). A little goes a long way, which is great considering the price.

I haven't been using it long, only about two weeks.  So I cant really say if it will ever really reduce the signs of aging around my mouth.  But I have noticed that my lips look healthier. Ive always had a huge problem with chapping and peeling  I have lip balms stuck everywhere because of it  and that has not been as severe since Ive been using the VENaffect.  In fact, I don't reach for the lip balm as much as I used to.  Lipstick does go on smoother when using it and it stays truer to color because the balm isn't watering it down. Actually, I prefer to put it on before any other makeup and smooth it in the area around my lips, too.

Its not exactly the type of thing Id want to carry around in one of my nice handbags for fear it the lid would come off  it would take up more space than a tube of balm anyway.  I try to use it at least three times per day: in the morning under my lipstick, before I go to the gym, and then again before bed.

The only sticking point for me, and the only reason I didn't give it five stars, is the price.  Eighty five dollars ($85.00) is a lot of money to pay for a tiny jar of lip cream.  As much as I love the product, I cant imagine paying that much for a lip treatment regularly.",1
Great way to clean your face if you need something for super sensitive skin. Smells great & I rarely get a zit anymore!,1
The product for your hair ever!,1
It is really nice and good to use and I always order it in different sizes to take with me if going to hair dresser or to travel and it has different  shads of color and that will help to choose,1
I bought this for a trip o Europe. I used it twice and it started to act funny it would turn on but the turn itself off after a few minutes. This continued for a couple of uses then refused to turn on at all. I had two weeks without a curling iron which was not fun. I can't return it as it is over 30 days so will just throw it out.,0
Saw absolutely no visible change's in my skin at all. Don't waste your money,0
It works great!,1
"I love this product! I was first introduced to it by my esthetician. I have sensitive skin and was having acne issues when I went to see her. I've been using this product for almost two years now and I haven't had any issues. I accidently ordered the non oil free moisturizer once and was nervous that my skin would react, but it didn't! I definitely recommend this product.",1
May be it's me.  Not crazy about this deodorant.  It actually makes me smell sweaty after a while - it seems to intensify that sweaty scent.  It may be due to the lavender fragrance.  This does not mean that this applies to every one.  Probably more to those who are not crazy about the lavender.,0
"I have been using this for 2 months to eliminate the dreaded Menopause Mustache and it has worked great! I have only used it on my face (upper lip and chin) and am so pleased with the results. I read and watched many reviews before purchasing, and followed the advice of others who said to use it a couple times week on stubborn facial hair (this is not what the manual suggests, so use at your own risk). I started at the lowest setting and worked my way to the strongest. I saw results after the second use. It does take time to see results. It will not happen immediately and the hair loss will be a bit patchy. Two months at using twice a week,  I am now free of annoying and embarrassing facial hair.",1
I love this stuff. I bought it from Amazon because Ulta doesn't do a good job with stocking up. This adds texture and manageability to clean hair. No need for hairspray. Spray it on and run fingers through.,1
not enough heat returned for credit,0
Not what I thought. I purchased this on a recommendation from my hair stylist.  About 2-3 weeks after I get my highlights/color I need to have some 'added help' with the nagging grays that work their way in.  I tried WOW and it was less than WOW.  It doesn't seem to cover up and I have to use a lot to make any progress... then it's too much.  Honestly I get better results with my $6 brown eye-shadow as it covers better.,0
"I love the Klorane shampoo for my silver hair, but this conditioner did not really condition my hair. It did not leave my hair feeling soft and manageable.",0
It's very pricey for the scent and product quality.  I personally like Biosilk's quality and scent A LOT more than Davines.  I initially  bought it because of everyone raving about how great it smelled and how nice it felt on their hair.  I won't be buying this again...don't really care for it.,0
Broken after 3times used... Never and never buy again.. :(,0
"At first try the color is pretty but its really clumpy and hard to put on. It looked like oatmeal when I put it on not at all like the other colors of these brand, maybe it was just me but I threw this out and for the price it was hard to do it.",0
"I bought this in nude pear and LOVE the creamy, almost buttery feel of this. I have been using MAC Lipglass for decades and this feels so much better. If the peptides and Benzyl Nicotinate have long term benefits, all the better.
I'd love more color and pearl and am going to order Santorini Red.",1
"I had high hopes for this considering the cost,  but it is overwhelmingly disappointing. It bleeds too easily and wears off on cups. Personally I love NYX and Lime Crime.",0
"After several tries, I could not figure out why this iron will not curl my hair. So I exchanged it for a new one. New one will not curl my hair. Makes curls, curls go straight. My hair is not difficult to curl, and I can make it curly just by twisting it around my finger and waiting for it to dry (takes a long time to dry, though). My old, broken curling iron that burns my fingers when I use it will set a curl into my hair that does not come out. Supposedly this one gets hotter. On a whim, I tested it with my Raytek Infrared Thermometer. The hottest part of this iron was 325F at the very center. Which should still be hot enough to make a curl that holds. Most of the rest of the wand was 285F. Since I've had it too long now to return it, I may just take it apart and see if I can't ""fix"" it myself.  Waste of money.",0
I absolutely love this stuff! So refreshing and I love the bigger bottle!,1
"After reading so many wonderful reviews on this product, I ordered it right away!  I must say though,it didn't do much for me.  It didn't give me the volume that I had hoped it would.  Plus I didn't like the very sticky feel to it. Therefore, only 2 stars.",0
So bad i order 2 and I received only one !!!,0
No visible change yet in the eyebrows.. have been using it for past 20 days.  Their eyelash product is gr8 though!,0
"I've been using many different pomades. This one is Terrible. It would  harden up my hair as if I applied a gel. Extremely disappointed, and I've never touched it since the first time of use. Also, it was very hard to apply on my hair and comb-thru. Bought a trash that I'd never buy again.",0
Great for that Michigan hard well water problem:),1
I NEVER get zits. I can try any new product and I won't break out. That being said- I got this item and I am breaking out. Very upset.,0
NICE.,1
"I was so excited to pick out my very first bottle of Butter 3-free nail polish. There were many gorgeous colors to choose from. I chose this one (Kerfuffle)...and I wish I hadn't. It didn't go on very nicely. It was obvious I couldn't even possibly get by temporarily with one coat. But mostly it reminds me of a colored ""White-Out"" I used years ago at my job. Every time I look down at my toes, I cringe because it's obvious I won't be happy until I remove it and put something else on.

I would be willing to try another color by this brand, but I can't recommend this one.",0
"After having a spot on my arm diagnosed as basal skin cancer, it was suggested I go through annual skin checks by a dermatologist. Besides obviously limiting my overall sun exposure, my dermatologist recommended that when I do go out in the sun to use a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher and one that is broad spectrum (protects against both UVA and UVB rays). This Nia 24 Sun Damage Prevention 100% Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 meets that criteria.  In addition, it contains Pro-Niacin, which according to their labeling, is clinically shown to visibly improve skin tone, texture and hyperpigmentation.  It has a light scent, is color and dye free, and is made in the United States.  All of this is good.

Now for the negatives.  Their labeling also states, This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, NOT skin cancer or early skin aging.  In addition, this product is not water or sweat resistant.  If not rubbed in all the way, your skin appears white.  I was able to receive this product free of charge from the Amazon Vine program.  When it arrived, I was surprised at just how small the container was, especially considering its price.  I personally cannot justify spending that much money on a sunscreen that may or may not help my skin look any younger than considerably less expensive sunscreens.  I will stick with more affordable brands.",0
Not one I really wanted.  Returned for refund...,0
"After it dries, it gets crumbly and flakey",0
Product had been opened prior to receiving and it smelled funny.,0
The hair spray is wonderful. It gives my hair volume without using much of it and no flaking!,1
"I have curly hair and live in an area that gets a lot of moisture. Regardless of what products I use, frizz is ever present. I have been using a CHI for years, but bought this BaByliss b/c my stylist recommended it. Perhaps this just wasn't the model for my hair-type- I found it to be flimsy and did not tame the frizz overall. I had to go back over my hair many times, and again the next day. I used a heat tamer protective spray, but the problem with that is, when I spray it on, my hair begins to wave and fluff up.",0
did not give volume to my fine hair,0
"I love love this!!! It is more like a cream with strawberry seeds then a face scrub. I used to have strawberry body scrub from fresh body market and was heart broken when they closed. This is exactly the same! smells great, real strawberry scent. I use this as a full body scrub.cleanser. It is also really great to shave your legs with. My skin feels so soft when I use this. I use this about once or twice a week. It seems expensive but mario's website always emails coupons and has sales. Try this for sure if you love the smell of strawberry!",1
Scent is still quite strong!,0
"Sadly, was disappointed with this OPI product.  The lacquer did not go on smoothly, and even after two coats, was streaky.  I have always loved the regular line, so hope this was a glitch.",0
"Bought two of these and there was no lip gloss in it, they were both dried out.  I wanted to return it but was not able to because the time was up even tho I just bought it a month ago.  I've bought these from Jane Iredale before and they were awesome.",0
This product is horrible.  It does not heat up well and worse than that.....it feels like it snags my hair as I straighten it.  Worst nightmare when using a straighter is when it feels like it is snagging my hair when pulling it thorough.  Worse feeling ever so do not recommend this one.,0
"I have fine straight hair, have been using various pomade type products over the years and like this one the best.  Compared to other products, this one is dry, so it doesn't leave you with a waxy wet feeling.  I like the hold it gives you, when ever it gets flat you can just run your hands through your hair and get volume back.  It is expensive, but you don't really need a lot of product in your hair for it to do its thing.",1
"I did use this product as indicated on the box and like every other young man that is losing his hair I am willing to spend any type of money to keep my hair, but his product is definitely not the solution. It just doesn't do anything for your hair the only result I obtained was less money in my pocket and a very dry scalp. Don't waste your money; you are going to regret it.",0
"Don't buy it, my face turned red and itching a lot",0
one of My new Favorite fragrances,1
Best shampoo I've ever used. Great for dry frizzy hair.,1
"First off, let me say I did not order this from Amazon but bought it at a dept. store.  My review is on the smell of the perfume.  It's very heavy and I didn't like it, but that's my fault for not trying it before buying.  I never took it back and it sat for years on my dresser and just recently I started using it as a bathroom air freshener.  It works great for that! I just don't like wearing it on my person! :-)",0
"This is a pretty decent moisturizing lotion, though it is a bit pricey. The good news is that it is nearly scent-free (when dry) and doesn't leave your skin feeling oily at all. It dries clear, of course, and leaves your skin feeling nice and smooth. I have been using it on the roughest, driest spots on my body - hands, elbows, knees and feet. It seems to work just as well as some other moisturizers I use (from Milk & Co, Neutrogena, and Eucerin). Because it is significantly more expensive than most other brands, however, I probably won't be ordering this again, and this is the main reason I am giving this a four-star rating, as opposed to a five-star rating.",1
"I got this mascara due to many positive reviews for contact wearers.  This mascara is great as it stays on ALL day.  I use an eyelash curler, and it stays put until I take it off for bed.  My eyes do get a little sensitive during the day though, like with any mascara I have tried.",1
I have been using Strivectin for years - I am 79 - use it in morning and at night just a dime size on each cheek - - get many compliments,1
Extends your tan!,1
"It's nearly impossible to find a 1"" curler so I bought this even though it cost twice as much as I wanted to spend.  It gets hot enough - I don't use the maximum temperature.  I wish it had fewer bristles.",1
"This product is a toner not a lotion. But that was not the problem for me. When I first sprayed the product, it was very obvious that it is highly fragrant. It smells like a mixture of cologne and lemon, but the smell of cologne is MUCH stronger than the lemon. I would appreciate it if Amazon would start listing ALL the ingredients on ALL skin care products for people with allergies. I really appreciate the good customer service that Amazon provided me with and gave me my money back.",0
Love this porfection powder! Helps complexion even out,1
Would not buy twice.,0
"Can't say it detanglerd all that great but had a little slip so maybe
 Still not so sure",0
Bought this for my girlfriend she liked it!,1
These make my lips dry and peeling.,0
"Very odd product.  Little to no scent, but slightly off in any event.  Seemed slightly moisturizing.  I love other Sabon products so surprised about this.",0
Great product and value,1
"I purchased after observing my hair stylist use this on my hair before blow-drying. The results were fantastic - changed my texture - making hair shiny, flowing, and smooth.  The price here was about 1/2 of what my salon was selling for and the 4.2 oz bottle will probably last me for a year as only a few drops are required for each application.  Only down-side is the product has a slightly unpleasant odor, like cabbage, out of the bottle. However, it goes away after applying to hair and completing drying and styling.  I plan to purchase again as this is best de-frizz, straighten, style serum product I have tried.  Thanks, Rusk!",1
"Rinse did not do anything to make my teeth whitier. In fact, I ended up with a mouth infection that causes brown tongue.",0
"By Boots No 7 T Zone rescue for $10...same product, save your money. We've all heard the hype about the magic French wonders of Bioderma but you can find great lower cost alternivtives",0
These razors barely shaved my face and left my entire neck razor burned it was horrible. As sensitive as my skin is i thought these would work so well and the price was way better than Gillette and what sold me initially was the rave reviews on how great they were..... Well needless to say i'm back to using Gillette these razors were horrible.,0
"Love this product. It is lightly scented, and best used for evening because it is a heavy cream.",1
I'm in my late 50's and I'm an aesthecian so I am always searching for the best for my buck to prolong the aging process.  I find this product has met my needs.  My skin looks healthier already and Ive only been using it at night for a week. The smell is more medicinal (than herbal what I am used to) but its still worth it for me.  I find it too heavy for daytime.,1
I love this product. I will be ordering more soon! Awesome stuff. I feel much better since Ive been using the product.,1
Way overpriced.  I lasted only about 3 weeks with once a day use.  I would recommend going to Trader Joe's and getting a nice bar of milled soap for about $3.30$,0
"Still like the idea of the combination compact and like how it goes on.  I do not carry this with me and use a ""poof"" style brush with it.  Be careful about dropping it though--the pressed powder just turns into dust.  Guessing it has less ""something"" (oil?) in it and it doesn't stick together as much.  No one intends to drop their compact on the counter but it does happen.  This one takes the hit really badly.",1
"Really good stuff, great coverage. It is a bit pricey however and I'm not sure that I've noticed a big enough difference in my skin to justify buying it again.",1
Use it every day! No breakouts!,1
"Clear solution dries out too quickly, cant effectively say it helped neither",0
"Wish I could give this ZERO stars. I paid a lot for this to get the name brand curler. Gave it to my daughter for her birthday. We were so disappointed. It barely curled her hair. A curling iron did it faster and so much better. Then, disaster!! It ate her hair. A huge, tangled mess. It took a lot of work to get her hair free. Not worth the risk of her hair getting burnt or stuck in the curler. Getting a refund.",0
Smells great!! Love it!,1
"worked great for a while. Then it stopped spinning... for the cost, found this product to perform poorly. FYI, I do have other BaByliss, which my family loves.. must have about 4 blow dryers by them..",0
Good,1
excellent,1
"Great, but very dusty around the house. So , I am wondering if it is healthy ? But great to hide bold spot!",1
"The smell of this shampoo is incomparable! Great! It really is!
But when I buy a shampoo I need a great quality, not a great smell.
First quality, then the smell.
And, for the quality, I won't buy it again.",0
"This product was not as expected. While it is still very nice, the color just isn't as metallic and gold as I would imagine.",0
"I have been using the Macadamia Professional's Weightless Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner for some time now, I tried this two-in-one and did not like it at all. It is not like their Flawless Cleansing Conditioner that comes in an aerosol can--which I love. This one leaves my hair greasy and does not spread or lather well. It works well as a conditioner if you shampoo after, but not as it should (IMO). I wouldn't buy again.",0
"Not strong enough.  If you have soft manageable hair, this indeed, is the gel for you.  If you have thick wavy hair, then look  somewhere else, this gel is weak.  I would compare it to got4b ultra.

I thought I'd try this gel due to the many good reviews this product has.  I've read they reformulated this product, probably all the good reviews were written before this product got changed.  I guess they screwed up this product just like the folks from moco de gorila screwed up when they reformulated their product.",0
This color is the best! Very sheer with a tiny hint of silver sparkle. Also it does not streak like some of the other CND shellac sparkly gels do. I will buy this again when I run out :),1
Doesn't stay with you and kinda stinks.....,0
Love this product and highly recommend it.,1
"This seems like a good quality lotion, your skin feels nice afterwards, but I CANNOT stand the horrific smell. It smells like diapers and it is so strong its nauseating. I HATE it.",0
"I am an older woman and this eyeliner was just not right for me.  It is too iridescent, I was looking for a more matte look.  Very disappointing. I gave it to my granddaughter who loved it.",0
not for me...did not take off eye make-up and left skin feeling tight,0
Purchased for my son who has had mild to moderate acne.  Not compliant with previous regimen of retinoic acid and topical antibiotic.  Works well and well tolerated thus far.  Not sure if he will need the addition of the topical antibiotic back.,1
This product keeps my curly haired the way that I like it! Purchase it for a strong hold with a soft touch.,1
Great product.,1
Didn't work great for what I was hoping... I think my skin had a reaction in the form of a rash to something that is in the shampoo so I won't be able to use it anymore. Smells great though!,0
"I must say I love this shampoo. It makes my hair soft and shiny and smells great (flowery but it doesn't linger) I don't believe it deposits any color at all but it has removed any dulling ""yellow"" from my silver hair.",1
This blow dryer vibrates terribly in your hand while using and that makes it very uncomfortable. I returned it and got a refund.,0
I really like this product,1
I have used this product for 4 months and all I can say is that it has done nothing at all.,0
Wonderful smell and easy on naturally grey hair.,1
"I agree with the other poster about the change in packaging. I've used the product for more than 10 years and love it. However I am no longer going to purchase it because of this change. Additionally, I believe that due to its new packaging the container is no longer recyclable -- bad. Interestingly enough, they did not change the packaging for any of their products.",0
"This first time I went to apply this, I would swear 1/2 the tube come out. It was everywhere. All over me , the tube , the sink. I decided it was best NOT to try to get it back into the tube. It's too bad I really loved the color and have always had great success with Blinc.",0
"I get the best shave ever using this product. I have a non adjustable merkur (forget the model) and I get a great shave from that one, however buying this I get an awesome shave from it. For my face I cannot go above three but I love that you can adjust how ""aggressive"" a shave you can get. I recommend everyone give this razor a try.",1
"Love it, pretty color",1
I love this product. I am 62 and have used this product for 4 years. I have NO neck crepeing.,1
"UPDATE: I'm almost certain I received a fake product. I probably wouldn't have noticed if I didn't take the time to upload a picture with this review. But looking online the packaging I received is VERY different from basically every picture you see when you Google the name of this product. It was sold and shipped by Amazon so I'm baffled as to why this even made it to me. Is there no quality control? Why is it even profitable to make a fake $18 nail polish? I hate that this is even something I have to worry about when buying from Amazon. Really disappointed.

[END OF UPDATE]

I'm giving this four stars instead of five because I wish it was a little more opaque so it would require less coats and therefore less time to apply. I guess this isn't necessarily a bad thing because someone may want a ""barely there"" look if you work somewhere that doesn't allow polish but you still want something to protect your nails. I think the color is perfect, it's the timeless iconic shade of millennial pink (aka the Pantone color ""pink dogwood"") Picture attached is after 3-4 coats. Please excuse my sloppy nail polish application (I'm working on it!).",0
"I was disappointed in this hand cream, for the size for the cost....and the ""age"" spots did not work...",0
Thus product interfered with my vision. Tried using it for a couple of weeks & my eye sight was seriously effected by the use of thus.  My vision was clearly poor with the use of this product,0
Love this product.,1
Leaves my hair feeling tangled and dry.,0
Too small for the price. It barely smell. The cap didn't match the bottle plus the plastic box was open ><,0
Curls don't last- my curls last better with my Conair clipless curler that was half the price,0
"As a devoted user of the Pevonia Clarigel Cleanser, I thought the problematic cream would be a good combination.  I had tried the SpaTeen line moisturizer, but as a 30-year old with acne, found the teen line too drying.  The Problematic cream started off well, but I really wasn't a fan of the slightly gritty texture or the smell that was too close to a household cleaner odor.  I kept using it for about two months, hoping it would help the acne, but I saw little to no improvement and it actually made my dry patches worse.  I finally switched to Pevonia's combination skin cream which has a better smell and no funny texture, so though it didn't help my acne, I at least got rid of the bad side effects.",0
"I should've read the ingredients much closer. While DERMAdoctor Calm, Cool & Corrected had some good, basic moisturizing due to the inexpensive Silicones Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, and Petrolatum...which ALL trap moisture underneath (oil based, NON-biodegradable chemicals). Unfortunately that is not good long term, as the skin can't ""breathe"" and the sloughing off of dead cells (natural exfoliation) is hampered. Unfortunately, I found this out after my cheeks and lower face developed patchiness. But the WORST ingredient to me is the SQUALANE which is from SHARK LIVER OIL (verified) which is obviously harvested from sharks. Not only does that seem unethical -  as ""approximately 3000 sharks are required to produce one ton of squalene"" (source: [...]) - the expensive cost of squalane (refined squalene) being a top ingredient in DERMAdoctor CC&C...is passed on to the consumer. While these ingredients may work for you, I need to look for a different solution.",0
"The battery lasts only for one use, I have to keep it on the charger all the time. I've been using it for about 3 months and the battery now doesn't even last for one use, it lasts only 10sec. I would've returned it but the return window is closed. It is really expensive brush for that to happen. Really disappointed.",0
The main thing to love about this tool is that you can control the amount of heat that the unit puts out. There's a dial with numbers bracketed within 'low' 'med' 'high' and 'extra hot'. Heats up quickly and maintains heat. Easy to use because it's got the grip on the end and the swivel base so the cord doesn't twist.,1
Good for thinning hair,1
I have been using this stuff for years! Im 62 years old and people often think Im in my 40s. I use this in the morning & Retin A at night,1
"Tried this product and it appeared that my skin reacted badly to it.  I have Type 2 rosacea (P&P) and tried this on a recommendation.  I broke out in a itchy rash over parts of my face that took weeks to completely heal.  Just to be sure that it was this SS that caused the reaction I tried it again a few weeks later on a small part of my face.  Same bad reaction.  May work fine for most, just not for me.",0
"I used this deodorant for two weeks. It did not keep me dry nor was it an effective deodorant.  Most disappointed, especially considering the extremely high price and the fact I had to pay a high shipping fee....even tho I am a prime member.  Shipping took overlong.
I see it has been removed from Amazon.  Probably for these reasons.",0
This palette allows me to play and achieve different color where i want to have it.  i just wish the brush was longer.... so i use my own brushes when at home.,1
This was a fake. It had no smell and it was clear in color.,0
Absolute JOKE!!! It turned on but did not heat up at all... I bought it for my partners birthday just to find out it doesnt heat up at all no matter what temperature it was on..... ,0
Great polish! Arrived as stated.,1
Sorry to report bliss did not give me a golden tan ... You have to spray over at least 2-3times,0
Works great!,1
"I liked this hair dryer while it worked. It was light and didn't tire my arm or wrist, it got hot enough to dry my hair, and it wasn't extremely loud like a lot of dryers are. However, after a month and a half of using it once every day for about 15 mins, it stopped blowing hot air. It still blew air and everything perfectly, it just stopped heating the air. So, I had to get rid of it because cold air does not work well to dry my long hair. I think it might have just been a lemon, because I know sometimes there's just going to be defective items in a group. Amazon customer service was quick to help me though, and I was able to get a refund.",0
BROKEN IN A MILLION PIECES NEVER GOT TO USE,0
"I think this dryer is just average or below. Nothing super special like the people in the other reviews that ""love"" it. Also, for me, it doesn't get hot enough. 2 stars for an expensive dryer..",0
Recommended by dermatologist.  Not a strong  enough  moisturizer  for me. Way too expensive.  There are other brands less expensive  that are better. Very  disappointed.,0
This was thick and clumped up on my skin. I sent it back.,0
Great stuff keeps my make up on and dows not come off until i take it off..also makes my skin feel so soft,1
Smells exactly like... my orange scented oil diffuser. I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing but I happen to like the smell of orange peels. This parfume is more reminiscent of air freshner than perfume.,1
I love this mascara. You can apply it for a very long time because it stays wet a long  time.,1
these curling irons are great while they work. but they only work for a few months before they stop heating up.  DONT BUY.,0
"I am obsessed with this face wash.  It doesn't leave me feeling dry, it has a pleasant scent, and it is a great price for the amount of product you get!",1
I have sensitive skin that gets red and irritated easily. This stuff is great for that as part of a whole skin care routine.,1
Excellent,1
Keeps skin moist and soft.,1
"The product has a very nice, clean scent, and worked well...but I offer there is a minor issue with the packaging. The pump on the bottle is too small, and I had to pump it repeatedly to get an amount in my hand large enough to be useful.

In the end, I took the pump out and put a cap on the bottle.",1
"Does wonders for my hair, I saw a difference immediately. What I don't like is the smell. Could you please leave all the good stuff in and leave out that awful scent?",1
"Amazing sunscreen for sensitive skin! I'm incredibly fair, so daily spf is a must for me. I also have highly sensitive, reactive, breakout prone skin and finding a sunscreen that doesn't give me a horrendous chemical reaction, break me out, or give me some kind of new skin issue has been a huge challenge. This product is perfect for me! It's lightweight, gentle, and perfect for sensitive skin types. I have worn it every day for a month and have experienced no issues. Avene know what they're doing for skin types like mine, love this french skincare line.",1
"Don't waste your money! Small box contains about 10 of what are usually free samples! Not worth $1.99 and definitely not $19.99!
Disappointed and ripped off!",0
Love it.  Not greasy and soaks in well.  Makes my face soft and smooth.,1
Great product easy to apply.,1
"I used Ouidad Products for my curly, dry hair several times. Shampoo, Conditioner and Serum. I expected to have at least a little improvement with my hair but it did nothing. Also a packega is useless, conditioner was too thick to pour so I had to use my finger to take it out each time.",0
"I have used this product several times and like it.  I told a couple friends about it and so we had a ""beauty salon"" day and I used it on them and they both liked it and plan to order.",1
Good product.  My daughter uses it to detangle hair.  It does the job.,1
"Much better than my chi. Creates less flyaways and because of it's slim design, I can style pieces I normally couldn't get to",1
I've been using this primer for years and it's simply the best! Lightweight and helps makeup go in smoothly.,1
Bought this for my son at his request for Christmas.  He loves this product.,1
Purchased product 1 year ago and now it will not heat up. Will have to purchase another curling iron to replace this one.,0
"I was a little disappointed because it didn't smell like I thought it would smell; I thought it would smell more like a linen scent; the smell of clothing straight from a dryer, not like a strong bathroom cleaner. In addition to the scent, the fragrance doesn't last long either.  Considering the way it smells, it may be a good thing that the smell doesn't last long but for the price i paid for this fragrance, I expected it to last a lot longer. I definitely won't be purchasing this again. If anyone knows of a fragrance that has a true clean linen scent, please let me know. Thanks!",0
"This is honestly the BEST moisturizer EVER! I have very dry skin from Retin A and a host of anti-acne products and this soothes my face w/o making it greasy or heavy. I have some kind of sensitivity issues with most ""white"" moisturizers and sunscreens but nothing with this! My face loves it! My dermatologist HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended it and gave me a bunch of samples to use before I purchased; this is definitely a product I will be purchasing. The price is somewhat high, but not as high as many department store moisturizers that are all smoke and mirrors anyway. I think this would last quite a long time while being extremely healthy for your skin!",1
I color my hair and have had to use some sort of antifrizz serum for years......but once I switched to this shampoo and conditioner I no longer need any other product! (Probably because it doesn't dry out and strip the hair) I have hair with a little wave in it....and can even go a day or two between washings.  I am very impressed. Ofcourse not as much suds as the sulfate shampoos (that is fine by me) and the smell is light ...kind of like coconut....but I can deal with that........at 38 I finally like my hair :),1
It runs so you look like a raccoon after a few hours,0
This lotion worked well on my face.  It has a pleasant scent and kept my face moist as I usually have very dry skin.,1
"I have light brown hair with heavy blonde highlights.  This shampoo does not soften or smooth my hair.  It actually makes it feel rough like dried straw after I rinse it out, and I always feel the need to follow up with conditioner to smooth it out.  I get the same results with the Gold Lust (even worse dried straw feeling!) and the Beautiful Color versions of Oribe shampoo. I wish this brand worked for me because I love the scent. 1 star for product and performance; 5 stars for fragrance.",0
"A soft floral fragrance shower oil, that goes on smoothly,  and the result is hydrated looking skin.  I like that it is not super oily, more like a richly conditioned body wash.  The fragrance is soft and not over powering.  I like how it made my skin look and feel.",1
"I really like the menthol-cooling properties of this lotion which is paraben free, vegan, and made with ""Arctic super fruits"" and ""Icelandic glacial water.""  It also has other well-known, unpronounceable ingredients.  Note that it was ""inspired"" by Iceland, not made there so that's a gimmick that this lotion doesn't need to promote it as a lightweight, day lotion.  It feels clean, refreshing, and does the job at a reasonable price. I love that they also use glass bottles rather than plastic containers.  I plan on trying their other products after being very satisfied with this lotion.",1
"I really liked this conditioner! I have naturally light brown hair with some blond/copper highlights from FOREVER ago. I bought this to see if it could maybe brighten up my old color (which has now turned into an ombre style) and to see if it could add some nice tone to my hair! I am a believer that this stuff actually works. I saw a noticeable difference in my hair, especially the parts that had been highlighted before. The color only lasts a few days, it washed out for me after about 3 shampoos (which was about a week). It's a really low-commitment product so if you're thinking of trying it out I'd highly recommend! My only complaint is that the copper version is borderline brassy.  might have left it in too long, but you gotta be careful. I think that maybe the tabacco version would have been better for my light brown color and I'm considering trying that one out instead.",1
I bought it and it did not make my teeth any whiter next time I will buy Crest or just try and find a good deal for a dentist that has zoom.,0
"Nice product, great for setting makeup, but definitely a luxury.",1
the bottom was broke,0
"Hate it. complete waste of money, very disappointed. Gel did absolutely nothing, and there was barely anything in the bottle to begin with.",0
"This product was obviously outdated and had already been opened as it was completely dried up and was not sealed. I gave this as a gift, and totally alarmed that it was in this conditioned when she opened.",0
Easy to use leave-in condition that leaves hair conditioned with the correct amount of moisture and has a clean scent; made with natural ingredients.,1
"i bought these because based on the photo and the description ""short set"" they were travel size.  they are NOT. they are huge, only for home use.  when i tried to return them i got a snippy reply that i should have ""known"" they were a large set since there were 12 rollers.  only if i were clairvoyant would i have known that. amazon stepped in to offer a refund.  would not order this brand again.",0
"Excellent product. Smells great and most important, it works!",1
"This is a very different type of foundation, very thick, it comes with a little spatula to remove some of the product for application.  This process did take a little getting used to for me, using the right amount and blending it evenly but once I got the hang of it it really did cover well and didn't use additional concealers with it.  I used a sponge to apply this and blend it for a nice even coverage, you could use your fingers, however if you are prone to breakouts or skin irritations then a sponge seems a better option for less oil and dirt. I used the Dermablend Powder over this foundation and it really set the look and lasted all day.",1
doe not dry out my nails like a lot of cheaper brands.......my nails are thin and I need all the help I can get!,1
"Good stuff. I have coarse, but not thick, oily scalp but dry hair. I spray this in and tousle it and it gives me nice messy beachy almost-curls. Smells nice, isn't too heavy, oily or sticky.",1
Doesn't come out fast enough for me to use. I even tried putting it on my brush but couldn't get enough out.,0
Really does not smell good.,0
I love love love this product.  It has saved me from wearing a hat all the time.  I didn't give it five stars because I can't apply it without help.,1
"I love the smell and the feel of this, got it directly from Mario Badescu salon in Manhattan. Upon looking at the ingredients (after I bought it and used once, of course) I noticed this product contains SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE-a foaming agent. In an age where cosmetic companies pride themselves by eliminating SODIUM LAURETH SULFATE from their products-a foaming agent, I do not understand why Mario Badescu still allows such ingredient into their products. Some products containing SLES have been found to also contain traces (up to 279 ppm) of 1,4-dioxane. Under Proposition 65, 1,4-dioxane is classified in the U.S. state of California to cause cancer.[11][12] The FDA encourages manufacturers to remove 1,4-dioxane, though it is not required by federal law. Dissapointing.",0
"heats up fine, i have bought hot tools in the past and loved them. This particular iron does not curl my hair at all. Ive also tried it on two other people and it didn't work on them either.",0
"Love this lip balm. I usually buy multiples at a time to have one in my purse,one at the office, by nightstand, etc... you get the ideal. I don't find myself reapplying too often with these so they tend to last longer as well.",1
"This did help my baby a lot on his scalp, plus it smells really good on my baby......highly recommended for babies....",1
My wlife was very u happy with this product..did not go on well.,0
Have been using for years.  Great price!  Thanks Amazon,1
I suspect this is a knock off.  The cap doesn't close tightly/is flimsy and the lotion is much heavier than what I am used to.  I have been using this lotion for years and am not getting the same results that I always have.,0
"This stuff worked magic on my poor baby's baby acne. Love, love, love it!",1
"Basically I thought I was buying the ""Ferarri"" of all dryers, but sadly not so. I really wish I just replaced my broken (the cord disconnected) Rusk Speedfreak hairdryer with a second. Hands down that is the quickest and smoothest dry you'll get if you have naturally curly, thick hair like myself. Everyday I sit there miserable as I'm drying my hair when I know I could of been done 15-20 minutes sooner and it also would of felt smoother & thinner with my old Rusk. The highest setting for heat isn't hot enough either. Sorry if this disappoints you reading this, but when I know first hand there is a way better dryer out there, I can't endorse this one, I can only wish that I could get all my money back and start over.",0
"This is such a pretty color!  Exactly what I was looking for and exactly the color I expected based on the photos.  Great coverage.  Could get away with a single coat, though I did two coats on my big toes to cover up some glitter polish I had on that wouldn't come off.  Finished with a quick dry top coat and it was perfect.",1
"Japonesque Velvet Touch Shadow Palette is one of the best eye shadows I have used.  I have very sensitive skin and usually stick to MAC cosmetics.  I decided to venture out and try something new.  Japonesque was perfect for my sensitive skin!

The shadow itself goes on smoothly and evenly.  In addition, it is long lasting and did not irritate my eyes, even when wearing contact lenses and dealing with seasonal allergies.  The best thing about the palette (in shade 02) is the richness of the colors.  Each is complimentary of one another and though they are in the same color group, the palette provides plenty of variety.

The biggest downside is the price.  While it is comparable to many brands found in higher end department stores, I usually would not spend this much for a shadow palette.  However, I would consider splurging on this one once in a while because of the quality.",1
"I've been putting this lotion on every night before I go to bed for about two weeks now and my hands feel great. I'm afraid that they are the driest and most roughened body parts, due to constant washing, so in dire need of moisturizing.  Within moments of application, my skin absorbs the lotion, without leaving any greasy residue. I also love the lavender scent - which is very soothing, especially at night. One thing I don't like is how the container seems to dispense too much. I prefer that it dispense less but there appears to be a lot of air packaged in. The lotion is not thick but more the consistency of whip cream.",1
"The spa that i had my luxurious mani pedi used Butter. I had the silver glitter. The next day it chipped. I went back to the spa to have a redo. The manicurist that did my nails was out for the day ( so we can't blame her)  I had someone else redo my nails. Next day they were chipped again. I love the color and concept but chipped nails are not to sexy.  She told me that they have problems with butter. in fact when I yelped the spa a lot of clients complained that their polish came off. Perhaps they should switch brands? We aren't here to talk spa just the polish.
There are other low toxicity  brands Like Gabriel out there that stay on and have twice the contents for half the money.
So all in all not worth one star really but I guess the color was nice for the little time i saw it.",0
"I typically don't wear perfume because most smell ""too perfumy"" (too strong, not natural, multiple scents) for me.  I got this one as a sample and it fits that bill. It's not a bad scent, but I wish I had received their ""Not a Perfume"" because that has great reviews and I may love it.",0
Good quality! I recommend it!,1
"Color was loud""",0
Um..... so this will change your toothpaste game. It tastes so yummy I don't even mind brushing and I hate that normal gross minty toothpaste flavor. I had been thinking of trying this for a long time and am glad I finally ordered it! There will be no going back for me to the drugstore brand.,1
Soooo yummy! Love the smell....never without it!,1
"Don't like it, doesn't work, I doesn't even absorb. Hopefully I can return it",0
Gamechanging. This stuff is the best and what youd buy in the pharmacy in Paris.,1
Disgusting. I wanted hair protectant not perfume! I can't use it bc of the perfume,0
"It works great! However, it is a lot smaller than what I expected.  Stays on all day & I love the color! It is great for contouring!",1
Don't buy ABBA from HHG Inc. My bottle is about 3/4 full- and who even knows what's in it. There was no plastic wrap like ABBA has when it comes straight from Amazon.,0
Been using this brand for several years and won't use anything else! Good for shoulder length hair!,1
"genuine, exactly the same as bottle purchased from the Mario Badescu NYC spa/",1
Too thick and it doesn't absorb into the skin and it's messy. I like palmers rose oil best.,0
I have dry skin and I really love this product. The sensation of it on your skin is very soothing as it hydrates the skin rather well. It works great as a base - keeps my foundation and blush in place all day. A lot pricey but it does as advertised.,1
I think I am going to be happy with this product.,0
I don't like the fragrance & it stayed sticky in my arm pits.,0
"Overall, I really like this lip pencil. I had never used a lip pencil before, and as someone who likes to go lighltlyly with makeup, I really prefer the look and feel of the pencil. It just seems neater and more distinct. I like the colors more than I thought I would. The pencil goes on easily, and is easy to blend. I love having the 2 colors. I had fun applying it with a young friend. The pencil is easy to sharpen, and doesn't crumble, break, etc. when sharpened.

My one reservation about this product is that when my lips were slightly chapped from windy conditions, the pencil seemed to irritate them. When my lips healed, this was no longer a problem.

Recommended, though others want to go easy on this  product when lips are unhappy.",1
"Hot tools just do not get hot enough for me.  The best curls come from super hot but not so long that you melt the hair.  Less is more, always.  I'm a hair stylist and prefer marcel irons and there's an awesome pm curling wand.",0
"Item came super fast! Amazing!

Bought this iron for my mom. She loves this brand. We both use it. Its amazing and leaves a beautiful curl.

Nice high heat and gets hot fast. Perfect for quick mornings.",1
"Cost is too much for the results received from the product. I have been using it since it arrived, per the directions, and have seen no difference.",0
Unfortunately I waited to open my item too late! I plugged it in and it does not even cut on. Now I can't return it it because I waited to open it past my window of opportunity! I wouldn't have rated it at all but I had to in order to post my comment!,0
Love it,1
"Over priced honestly.

1 part  Olive oil
2 parts Castor oil
6-12 drops of essential oil. (sandalwood)

There your set",0
"I wasn't able to try it because when I opened it, I found that the gloss had broken off inside the cap.",0
"NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN!
Think about it before buying.

Made my hair worse. Total waste of money and you can't return it! Even local beauty supply store would let you return product that does not work.
Good luck.

sanaj",0
"Definitely a great fragrance! I love its fruity smell. I received many compliments, even from a few women, something I didn't expect! I would definitely recommend this product!",1
"Light and airy that helps with my wife's rough skin beautifully. Some of these creams can be oily and slick but she says that it applies evenly and smoothly. Worked great with her skin type and she said she would use it again.

Costly but well worth it.",1
"I'm a guy with pretty thin hair and it's quite difficult to find a pomade that tames it (especially during the winter/wind). This stuff is OK. You wet the hair, apply this, then presumably let air-dry. The problem is that if you ""tussle"" your hair at all/ run fingers through it, it immediately frizzes like crazy (and doesn't really return to ""normal"" until you do the whole process again). The only way I've found it to work is in combination with other products, otherwise I have to avoid touching my head in fear of frizz (even if I go outside, still gets pretty frizzy regardless). The plus side is that there is very little shine and it's VERY easy to wash out, but there is kind of an unpleasant crusty feeling. Also pretty expensive...the packaging is nice though...",0
Pretty messed up how I paid $99.00 and right on the box it says $38!! I paid $99.00 for travel size products. I am not happy at all with this purchase do not buy,0
"Not crazy about this . . .  It does say 'red', i thought i ordered soft pink. so..it's a bit coral but still soft.  Also, it's like a wax
which is nice because it's not sticky at all.",0
Use this everyday with no buildup or heavy weight. Received in a timely way.,1
Not up to par for pureology,0
"This product has a nice smell. My main impression is more of spice than flowers. I suppose my nose isn't very accurate, but either way, it smells better than the description sounds.",1
This is a great soap for shaving your head. I used other soap and it was hard on my skin. It lathers great and feels nice on my skin.,1
My hair dresser uses this and loves it so I had to give it a try and really like it.,1
"I've worn Mankind daily for the past 5 years, and I've always bought the fragrance at a retailer like Macy's.  I was excited to see the same product at such a good price here on Amazon.

The product showed up quickly and in a sealed retail package.  When I sprayed it on in the same fashion as I'd been using for the past several years, I immediately noticed that the scent was significantly weaker than my previous bottle which was still sitting on the countertop.  It's definitely the same scent, but noticeably weaker.

The product in the previous bottles easily lasted almost 10 hours-- this stuff wears off after about an hour.  I doubt that Kenneth Cole changed the formulation of the product.

I have to wonder if this product is counterfeit.",0
not weight loss.  I did go.... alot,0
"I have straight, long, fine, slick hair. I've got a decent amount of it, but I do like pumping up the volume if I can, and I find that so many hairstyles these days revolve around highly textured hair, which mine never wants to be. I watched some great YouTube video reviews on this product, which may have set my expectations too high; but I found this to be about on par with using hairspray to rough my hair up.

I didn't find, as the other reviews said, that it takes almost none of the product to work; I had to put a fair amount on to get much reaction from my hair. And I can put up with a bit of a sticky feeling if it makes my hair behave itself, but I didn't feel like the results warranted that inconvenience.

I did notice what the other reviewers said, that using this product prevents shampoo from lathering. It's actually kind of funny! I think my hair is still getting clean if the shampoo doesn't lather--right? Just to be safe, I've shampooed my hair twice after using it, because the second time it lathers just fine. I'm sure that's unnecessary.",0
"I love this cleanser, recommended to me by my derm",1
"Working very well, but if you get a little water on it, the color of the iron will bleed.",1
"I guess I should have realized this would be yellow by having ""chick"" in the polish name. It didn't look that yellow on my phone. It's definitely yellow, not the neutral color I was expecting.",0
"What you see is  the image of a regular sized shampoo bottle, which I thought I was getting: however, what you really get is a small travel size L'Anza, shampoo bottle.  My mistake for not looking at the ounces; however, that image is not what you are buying: check the ounce amount first",0
Good product,1
This works really well to get the frizzies under control.  It takes practice to figure out how much to spray on.,1
"Smells pleasant, works well.  I got some on my skin and it burned a little.  My mistake, but warning is warning.",1
"I wanted this to do something for me but it didnt. I ended up with stretch marks anyways once my baby dropped. I think that stretch marks are something you're either going to get or you wont, depending upon your genetics. This did help with the itching though.",1
"I recently took the plunge as many would say into DE razors and figured to try these blades first. The first shave was amazingly smooth along with several nicks here and there due to the fact that I just started. The second shave still smooth but nothing like the first. The third shave, now this one was rough just as I found my groove and how to hold the razor and the direction I'm supposed to shave. Unfortunately the shave got progressively worse as I continued to go through them. Any advice?",0
I love the fresh & clean fragrance!  Got lots of compliments!,1
"This shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel like straw. It does not help with the growth or thickness, it just changes the texture of my hair to give off a thicker texture which is hard to manage and hard to style.",0
You don't get the streaks that occur with liquids.  You need to use often to get the result you want.,1
"This is a good option for sulfate-free shampoo. The bottle may seem small but it lasts quite a while, you really do not need much to lather up really well. Smell is pleasant but fairly neutral and not powerful so it doesn't clash with whatever else you're putting in your hair.

Overall a good shampoo despite the rather high price, recommended.",1
"Like the negative reviews said, its a knock off. Color was way off",0
if you want a great product that soothes your sore area's of your body this is what you want to purchase,1
Great!!!!,1
This is not the real deal! Returned it after using it twice over a weeks time. Made my hair frizzy and awful. Really Pureology is amazing. This looks and smells similar but it is not exact and the bottle color is off!,0
The cream hardens my hair and leaves a white residue. I will not purchase this item again.,0
"Did not make any significant difference in my (long) hair. Smells weird, like orange cleaner. Can not recommend.",0
I think I might have received a fake as well. I have purchased one from Ulta and it works way better than this one. Better go safe and purchase it at a store,0
The owner really needs to work on updating and correcting the colors shown in the description. I opened mine and it was 3 shades lighter! I can't use it!! I have returned it and asked for a refund.,0
Not the original,0
"I must be gluten free which is why I chose Juice Beauty, but wow! My skin looks amazing! I'm hooked!",1
this stuff is amazing!  I color my hair and this product by far keeps the color almost 2 weeks longer for me!,1
"I've been using it since July 2016 and its now November, and I see no difference. My hair is thinner than ever due to alopecia. I used it religiously and am furious that there is no return policy if it doesn't work. I can't understand why my dermatologist suggested I try this when the reviews are so bad here. Only two good ones out of many. Hmmm???? A hoax???? If it takes 5 months to work or 3-4 mnths to show a difference, why is the return policy only 30 days. Nonsense. ""A device to depart the desparate from their dollars,"" said another reviewer.",0
"Does not cleanse pores leaves them dirty, kinda a waste of money. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS
Only good for massaging your face.",0
I love this curling iron but now I get an error message and it no longer turns.  Haven't had the product for a year.  I am hoping the seller can make good on this and I can leave a 5 star review.  Please advise.,0
"3/4 times i use this product, it leaves it sticky and heavy. It feels like spraying hair spray on your roots. It does provide body, but it certainly does not provide a clean feeling to your roots.",0
"Always on the lookout for a great razor burn treatment, I decided to give Jack Black a whirl--I found that I have used better and more soothing products than this one.",0
"It came!! Someone had opened it can left it in the garage but it was found, can't wait to start using it.",1
"Love that it's safe and natural, but just wasn't enough moisture for me.",0
"I have been using this stuff for years! I love it. Makes your hair shiny, soft and very smooth.",1
My determatologist gave me this product and I like it.,1
Nothing special,0
"This just sits on top of my skin and doesn't do anything special.  Does about the same as a $10 jar of a drugstore brand.  While it didn't make my skin issues worse, it certainly didn't help",0
It came totally broken.,0
The product is as described and works well.,1
This pencil did not push up from the bottom so was unable to use it except a few times. I tried turning the base of the pencil to push up the lead but it did not work. Will not order again.ncil,0
Good product,1
"Doesn't work at all. I am really upset I wasted so much money on something that does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!! I bought this back in May and have only used it on my under arms. I used as directed with no results. Then I tried once a week with no results. I wanted to do just one area. So I could really find out if it worked before the cartridge ran out. I can say for a fact that I have not experienced 6 weeks hair free. I haven't even experienced a week hair free. I should have returned it and got my money back, but 30 days wasn't enough time to find out if it worked.",0
"My wife loves this nighttime cream/therapy. It helps her fight dryness, and it appears to be firming. This is no cheesy cream you find in the discount stores, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price. Well, I guess it's a small price vs. cosmetic surgery.",1
"This Clarisonic purchase was legit beware to only buy from amazon.com. I called the company, I have my 2 year warranty, also, it worked fine so far (I have only used it twice). Also, be sure you charge it for 24 hours prior first use, don't even verify if the device is working, charge it first, this will make sure your device won't die faster.

Overall the only reason why I am giving a 4 stars to the product is because the device came with some black scuff in the front and I have no idea of the why.",1
"My wife has been using this product for the last couple weeks, she is a face product fanatic, she has tried countless products, and loved this one. Has a very subtle smell, not overpowering, but very pleasant. Does sting a little when applying close to the eyes, but this is normal for a skin toner. Left her skin feeling smooth and refreshed, not oily at all. Would not recommend as a makeup remover, but more as a cleanser maybe after a shower. Over all a great skin product, would recommend.",1
Great product,1
"Its a good for my skin. However, it does make my face little sticky. I use it while I am home because Aleo vera is great for skin. I think the stickness comes from the Aleo Vera.",1
"Heats up quickly and evenly, and curls well. The kick stand is entirely removable, and the cord swivels well, so nothing gets in the way. The separate temperature control and on/off switch, plus the lack of an auto shut off makes this perfect for someone who curls their hair frequently and wants to have more control. Excellent, professional-feeling tool.",1
"Only been a couple days but already very pleased with this moisturizer.

Beyond providing good moisturizing, this product met or exceeded my expectations by not only being fragrance-free, but virtually smell-free once applied. If does have the slightest essence of sunscreen if you sniff it directly, but once on my face there were no chemical emanations that other products I've used seem to have that would suddenly and unexpectedly make my eyes sting.

Another key is that it absorbs almost immediately and leaves you no more oily than if you used no lotion-type product. For a daily moisturizer with a moderate sunscreen, it's very good and probably unreasonable to expect more.

One thing I will say is that it took quite a few pumps to get it primed and working. Almost thought the pump was not going to work. I do wish there was a full cap, which would be better for travel, rather than just the loose-fitting partial cap (see photo), which seems more for transportation and sanitation (and probably intended to be discarded.)

I was hesitant to spend this much but since the cheaper options were not up to snuff, I figured it was time to try something that it supposed to be better. Hopefully this will last awhile and remain shelf stable throughout so it will be economical in the end.",1
I really liked this mask. It helped lighten my scars up from acne by using it every other night. If you use it more u might get at least one whitehead from it but that should not scare you from purchasing it. The delivery was fast and good as well. I will absolutely purchase again.,1
"I purchased my first one in a store, after trying it out.  I bought my replacement online for the same price as in-store.  I just didn't have time to go to a brick-and-mortar this time.  It goes on shimmery, but fades in, like a lip stain, which is what I wanted.  I wanted a more natural pink color, that didn't make me look like I was wearing tons of lipstick.  It smells yummy, and my lover hasn't complained of it tasting ""funny."" Love it!",1
this is a watered down version of the real Oil..,0
It is a good straightener but there are better straightener.,1
"While comfortable and non-irritating, the formula is really very dry, and the coverage lighter than I anticipated from this brand.  Not suited for dry skin areas, but the dryer formula does help it wear long.

The color is very very very warm ( and my skin is warm undertoned).  Too warm for me.  Also, too warm to be suitable for use as a contouring/highlighting concealer.",1
"Recently purchased this product for use on my shoulders. Immediately the shoulders of my shirts became bleached. I think 5% benzoyl is too strong, disappointed with ruined shirts now",0
Lots of reviews complaining about the nozzle but I didn't have a problem at all. It wasn't too much of a problem and I didn't waste a single drop. The product itself worked alright. I liked the feeling my skin had after using it but I'd probably not get it again.,0
"I bought it,  but didn't use it the first couple of months.  By the time I opened it and realized it was broken,  the 30 day rerun period had emptied.  Sucks to spend $130 on a doorstop lol.  Tried contacting clarisonic to exchange it,  but no response from the company, so I wouldn't rely on their customer service.",0
Great product. Delivered as promised!,1
"This does not work properly, it does not heat up to full heat  & does not hold the curls in my hair.  Completely defected.  Don't waste your $.",0
I gave the shampoo to my mom and I kept the conditioner,1
above two items great. the book below not received yet?,1
Product is separated and won't seem to mix properly. Might be expired...,0
"While this is not specifically a women-only product, my wife was interested in trying it out.  The marketing is women- centric, but there's nothing in the documentation that would limit the use or the benefit to men as well.  She's authored this review

Seems like a nice product, feels sturdy and is easy to use.  It says its a five minute routine, but can be done in even less time.  It will require some dedication as it is supposed to be used nearly every day to see results.  Ive only used it a few times so far, and I can maybe see a little more definition around my cheekbones.  Im also still in my thirties, so I can hope that I don't need lots of facial toning yet, although my husband might disagree.  :)

I think any changes that you see will be subtle ones.  It does not hurt at all, and I even have it turned all the way up, so if you have sensitive skin, there is the ability to lessen the current.  In some areas of my face, I cant feel anything at all.  In other areas, it feels like a slight tingling but definitely not pain.  The ball ends feel cool and are somewhat relaxing as you glide over your face.  The gel seems expensive at $12 for 2 ounces.  Some other reviewers have mentioned using aloe vera gel instead, so I may try this.  There are no miracles, but I like this facial trainer and will continue to see if there is more impact.",1
"I am someone who gets color touch-up on roots every 4 weeks so I don't typically worry about trying to cover them up for the short time I have any coming thru.  I have not tried any root cover up products so I can't compare this one to any others.  I decided to go ahead and try this product to have something available in the summer when I want to pull my hair back and purchased via Amazon.

I was not impressed at all.  The grey areas I usually have to cover up are around my temples/sides of my head.  This product did not cover the grey there - at all!  The brown covered my scalp and left grey hairs which looked goofy!  I would not purchase again even if super low cost.  Disappointed!",0
Color was a lot brighter than expected when I put it on. Wish I could return it.,0
"Junk mascara in my opinion! I used 2 coats which did not even match a single coat of YSL or Tarte mascara. Took 3 rounds of using my mascara remover (which removes even waterproof in one sweep) to get this stuff off. Very clumpy when removing, leaving my lashes sticking together. In the end it cost me several lashes which did not make me happy. I definitely do not recommend nor will I buy this brand again.",0
"perfect for my skin, i use everyday in the moring. keep my skin moist for a whole morning. recommend it",1
"Must've gotten a bad one, mine wouldn't heat up too much",0
"This glaze really does feel salon-quality.  I have started using it once a week in place of conditioner, per instructions, and it does add shine and silkiness to my hair.  To give context, I have long, medium textured hair that is color treated.  I felt like the glaze was nice and thick, like a hair mask treatment.  The smell was fine, and you let it stay in your hair for about 5 minutes and then wash it out.  My hair was softer and shinier for several days thereafter.  My only complaint is the price.  However, if you figure that you use it once a week, then one bottle should last a while, especially if your hair is shorter than mine!",1
Very good shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair.,1
"I give this nail polish a 5 rating. I love the flat black color, its amazing.
Best nail polish I have ever bought, hands down.",1
Love this product.  I use it before straightening my hair.,1
I don't know if this was an old bottle or if it was fake but the smell is different than the bottles Ive gotten at Ulta. Id recommend buying it there.,0
"I bought this about a month ago. I was totally shocked when I received it as it was not in a secured package - no amazon tape securing the box, no air bags, etc.  Just a label on an unsecured product box.  Shipping concerns aside, I have noticed definite improvement in 4 weeks.  However - the improvement is not on fine lines, wrinkles and age spots - it's been on my acne scars of 20 years!  Very pleased that it is reducing the unevenness of my skin and the appearance of the scars.  My face also feels a LOT smoother, and the color is more even.
I find that the product doesn't work well on my forehead (not sure why that is), and that it doesn't hold a charge for very long.  Also, the laser gets dirty very quickly and that reduces the effectiveness. I'm hoping to find a review that addresses a good way to clean it.
Overall - I'm happy I invested $500.00 because I feel like my face looks that much better.",1
"Did not like the scent, felt it was too strong. And it's very expensive for such a tiny bottle.
$10 for  40ml. It would've been worth it if I liked it.",0
"Very good eye liner. I am pretty good at getting a decent line, so I can't comment on this product being a ""game changer"" regarding ease of use. One thing that does kind of bother me though is the way the product occasionally dispenses too sparsely, requiring me to recap, shake, and reapply to get a darker line.  This is a super waterproof liner. It survives 45 mins on the stair master without a single smudge, by the end of which I'm sweating buckets, which is pretty outstanding. It also causes no irritation at all and I have very sensitive, allergy prone skin.",1
"It feels really nice On my lips, but that's just it, it sits ontop of my lips. It does not moisturize or do anything for my skin. After it wears off (which happens pretty soon after application), my lips are left dry, and cracked.",0
"What more can one say?  It's Proaso, and it smells and lathers great!",1
"Totally matte, which I love! Feels light on my face.l",1
Purchased in August and it stopped working within 6 months.  BaByBliss is on of my favorite but this one was a real disappointment.,0
Fell apart and broke within two weeks. Not worth paying the shipping to return. Stick with tried and true Shiseido or Revlon curler in my opinion.,0
I carefully followed the directions but it does not bring results. The product was pricey and did not do much for my hair. Very disappointed.,0
Not sure what happened but I never received this product.  Love it though!,0
I have hives after the use of this product.  I really need a good product that won't cause problems. What's next?,0
"Absolutely NOT what was advertised.  Product is NOT the size amount stated, and not in the same container as displayed.",0
I use this in lieu of a foundation.  Very light but good coverage.,1
"Product smells old and is slimy. I have been using this stuff for years, and it should not have this smell or consistency:(",0
So far my wife is well satisfied with the product. A little too soon to see any positive results. Time will tell.,1
This thing doesn't do much ,0
"Just, yes! I love this hair treatment. I use a hair treatment on my hair once a week alternating between treatments each week and this is always one of my favorite when its turn is up. Unite is best or best in hair care, always good results. I do recommend when using products that are not all natural (such as the brand Acure) to wash and condition hair first. Some products are known to affect sensitive skin and cause acne. This brand is not free of those ingredients. Wash your face and back well afterwards to remove any residual products left on your skin from rinsing.",1
Ive been using it and it seems to helping my ends alot. I am transitioning and really don't want to cut my hair just yet. So its preventing my damaged end from spliting up even more.,1
I barely smell a perfume. It's water not perfume...,0
This product is a must have. I've been using this for years to add tons of volume to a simple curled look:) (be aware that a little does go a long way though),1
Works well for touch ups!,1
"really great flat iron, i have to wash my hair to get the straight out. it really does it job",1
There is synthetic red dye in the shell of the pill. I won't take them and I wouldnt have bought them if I had know the ingredients had fake dyes.,0
This is a beautiful neutral shade. Looks great on all skin tones.,1
I had the revo styler and always looked for a replacement. They does the job. My hair does sometimes get tangled but I think my hair may be getting to long for this product. I love how it leaves my hair shiny and smooth.,1
Hair dryer didn't even last a year before the heating element went out.  My first time trying a BaByliss product and I won't be trying again...,0
"I use this to massage my daughter's aching muscles after swim practice. She says it seems to relax her muscles quite well, and the scent is quite pleasant.",1
This conditioner smells horrible. I have loved every Biolage product I've ever used but this verges on disgusting.,0
Not great for straightening.  Ok for curls but eventually I had to buy something else.,0
"This did not work so well for me. The color was darker than I expected. It did not cover that well, even after applying several layers per directions. It was sticky and dried streaky. Try their camo version for better coverage.",0
"I bought this on here a couple of years ago. I am so mad ,i wasted over $200.00 dollars on this. I tried every few weeks and it did nothing but hurt. I read all the reviews and was sold. This does not work and I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.",0
"This is a counterfeit nail polish! Do not buy.
I purchased the color Rosey Future and it does not match the consistency and color of the original OPI color. Even the bottle looks different. What I received did not match the image listed here. Really disappointed.",0
Very sad I didn't pay any attention to the one star reviews before purchasing. My product was also counterfeit. Seal was reglued and the product itself was definitely not the real PCA face wash. I had gotten a travel size from the actual website to try and it was amazing. Tried to save just a little by buying off of amazon but I should have just spent a few more on the actual website.,0
Best thing ever. I saw so much improvement in just one use...and i did a second treatment with the olaplex2 and wow. This product is great,1
Great color... a nice neutral - doesn't clash with anything...,1
"I never used a product like this before, and was a little skeptical.  I must say, it exceeded my expectations by a long way.  Great lather.  I shave about 3 times a week, and this think is gonna last me awhile.  Awesome.",1
Best beach spray out there.,1
Love this Shampoo & Conditioner leaves my hair soft and silky. Hair has improved a lot since I been using it,1
"I love this product! It's lasted me a long time, has a decent hold without making my hair especially clumpy. Not an especially strong hold, but it's not advertised as such.",1
"Haven't tried yet, but love this lines products",1
If I could give this no stars I would - orange and bergamot hand soap is definitely an imposter.  Have bought this many times just never through Amazon and this is not the real MB I know of. I just wasted $28 on fake commercial hand soap that could have come out of a gas station bathroom. Disappointing for sure. Lesson learned.,0
"I love Essie nail poslish, but I just ordered 3 colors of supposedly ""Essie"" and what I received appears to be nothing like what I get in the stores. First thing I noticed was how thin it was compared to what I already have that I purchased in the store. Secondly, I have had it on for almost 3 hours and it's already chipping. The real Essie I had on previously last for almost 2 weeks, went on with one coat and didn't chip even after a long weekend of yard work without any gloves. This is a rip-off! Don't waste your money.",0
"I tried to return it, but had no success. This product is not good for my hair. Possibly will be great for a different hair type, but when I use it my short hair becomes dry and more difficulty to manage, no longer soft.",0
"As others have noted, it turns your scalp and forehead red.  Every time I would use it, I would get a terrible headache too.",0
This item works great. Received in perfect condition and on time.  It is difficult to find this size curling iron that heats well enough to curl very wavy short hair. Kudos to Hot Tools for remembering there are some that maintain Natural short hair.,1
"My favorite nail color.  Was great until I loaned it to my stepmom so she could touch up her nails, and I never got it back. Now I have to order a new bottle. ;)",1
I usually love this product but it was shipped without a cap. It will most likely dry out prior to using up all the product.,0
"Uhm... Be careful using if you use Retin-A. Also, avoid using on eyes. Stings a lot and turned my face red. I'd be curious to see how my skin reacts when not using retin-a.",0
Good product!,1
"This is one of the most beautiful objects I've ever held in my hands. So elegant. A little silver stick that pulls back and unhinges into a pair of nail clippers.

There's just one problem, the clippers don't actually clip. Perhaps my manly nails are just too thick. Or rugged from all that heavy typing-on-keyboards work they do all day. Except my wife tried these clippers and it didn't clip her nails either. It makes a slight dent, but it never quite scissors through.

I think probably a larger pair with a tighter hinge would get more torque. Or it may just be that this design is too beautiful to be functional. (Sort of like the name ""Zwilling J.A. Henkels"". Imagine trying to convince a police officer that truly was your real name.)

Perhaps there is a quality control issue and I just got a bad one? I hate to give a bad review to something that was so clearly designed with great care and attention. But if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.",0
I like this cream. it does moisturize well. but leaved eye area a little greasy looking. so I only use it at night.,1
Pretty color,1
"Amazing - great for baby acne, and general cleaning. We use tons of this.",1
"It tingles! I think it helps with irritation I get from eczema, and it leaves my hair soft and well conditioned. Overall, a nice product that makes my itchy scalp feel much better.",1
"It didn't work all that great and wasn't worth the money. We will not. Be reordering it , nor can we recommend it.",0
Product arrived damaged and half empty.,0
"Beautiful color for my complexion and I am extremely fair. Lovely feeling on the lips, absolutely no irritation and NOT sticky! Lasts several hours and actually resembles a lip balm in consistency, etc than expected.",1
I did not receive what I was expecting as far as the scent. I have worn this scent for years This one smells watered down and scent does not last,0
This works perfectly as a pre-shampoo treatment for dry scalp. I have a number of Leonor Greyl products and they are all great.,1
"Worked for almost 1 1/2 years, bought it thinking by paying more it would last don't  buy it!",0
"As a user of Layrite Superhold, I wanted to try something which claimed a matte finish with a high hold because my hair fish hooks at the end and I wanted to keep it straight.

This stuff is near impossible to use. To even be able to work it between your hands, you need to heat the product up with a hair dryer or add water. It has absolutely no hold with water added to it. If you do somehow manage to heat it up and work it between your hands, then the first strand of dry hair you touch will grab it off your hand and you will be left with a giant chunk of this stuff. Combing through dry hair is sure to either break your comb or scalp you. This stuff is so un-workable in its room temperature state, that I have actually put it in the microwave for 8 seconds to even achieve anything.

No. The product doesn't flake if you re-comb through the day. But that is assuming you are even able to make an attempt at putting it in your hair.

So if you want a decent hold with a matte/semi-matte finish, I have found the best results by applying Layrite Superhold into slightly damp hair and then blow-drying into place while alternating between hot and cool.",0
"These colors are only mildly pigmented, which makes them nice for very fair skin tones. The pink has a bit more saturation than the bronzer color. I get the feeling this set wants to be like the Nars Orgasm/Laguna set, but unfortunately, the texture and finish just aren't as smooth, especially the pink. The pink comes off as a bright pink if you try to build it up (which you have to do in order to get it to show up at all in the first place). So you really have to find the magic amount to use. It is somewhat powdery or lightly chalky - not the texture quality you might be used to if you buy high end brands. It does not feel heavy on the skin though, which is nice. It seems to wear pretty well, despite the texture and consistency. The bronzer needs a lot of building up to be able to see it on the skin and I am fair skinned. I am curious now as to the performance of the other em sets with the peachy or mauve shades instead of the pink. They might be a better option for me.  I do own the Nars Laguna/Orgasm set and prefer that a lot more, for a pink set. If you're looking at this one, I'd recommend the Nars instead due to better performance an higher quality.",1
"Spend the extra money and buy something better ,this truly belong inside a trash can ready for pickup!",0
"My all time favorite scrub.  Wish it were a little less expensive, but it's worth splurging on this! My skin has never been this soft!",1
It was used!! I was so beyond excited for this product- I am just getting into makeup and wanted to try out this brand because I've seen great reviews on YouTube. Everything looked great until I opened up the palette and saw finger smudges in the Instain and TheBalmGirls. Argh. I'm so bummed.,0
ok - find it a little too conditioning for fine hair leaves my hair flat,1
not worth the money,0
"As much as I like this candle, it is a rip off for the price. The candles are small...about 5 ounces..and the cost is not worth it. Try going directly to the company to see if you can get it cheaper as opposed to buying from these mom and pop vendors. You will be disappointed at the size of this candle.",0
great service by the company that sold this but this is expensive and doesn't last past an Hour,0
"Have used the product for years and have been disappointed in my last several jars....no longer has the thickness or scent it used to have.  As other reviewers have indicated, the cream was MUCH thicker previously and now it is similar to whipped cream.  The scent also has diminished considerably over the years.  You can still get a good shave if you use almost double the amount of cream (otherwise I would given one star).  I recently used an old travel tube and the difference was striking and confirmed all of my suspicions. Sadly, this will be my last jar and I will start looking for something else.",0
Why the label was already pealed off?,0
It had spilled all out into the box,0
"This was one of the better facial water cleansers I have used. It was gentle enough for my skin and removed most of my makeup and oil. It didn't remove everything and the smell was a bit overpowering, but overall it is a great product with many uses especially if you have oily to combination skin. I would repurchase.",1
"Love this nail color. It's rich and luxurious. Goes on smoothly and dries fairly quickly. Can't say it lasts any longer than most polishes, but that's the nature of the product.",1
Love it and the smell OMG.,1
"I ordered a 33oz bottle of body wash and received a 12oz (ish - I don't remember, but it was no taller than my hand) bottle of hand soap. Didnt get it sent back in time so Im stuck with overpriced hand soap that I didn't need. I love this line of products and this is the first time Ive not received what I ordered. To say that I am disappointed is a gross understatement.",0
"This stuff is great!! Keeps my hair frizz-free and gorgeous! Great experience ordering this, too. Wonderful product. I used it last night and will order again when needed.",1
I ordered this an got two straight edge scissor blades instaed.,0
When my boyfriend changed over to Billy Jealousy's hydroplane shave cream his face has never been smoother. When i smooch his face no more pricklies! And it makes him smell good too! And let me tell you what ladies... it works great on legs too!!,1
"It seems like my previous review has been deleted. But I feel compelled to warn other customers who might buy this product. It doesn't seem to be the real one sold at the stores.

The package was so poorly constructed when arrived that I can't believe it could be made by Mario Badescu
1. Cap was slanted, so I couldn't close the jar tightly which results in drying of the products eventually
2. The twirly part of the jar is also slanted
3. The sticker that contains the brand and product information wasn't stuck on the jar correctly. When I tried to open the jar, it pulled the sticker off with it. WTH?

Lastly, I would never buy this again because the jar came filled with only 2/3 of the products (shown in picture). If this product is made by Mario Badescu, it shouldn't have left their facility! Amazon, check your seller and the product quality please!",0
This product was just satisfactory not much volume,0
"My beautician used this on my hair after I had a full color. I fell in love with it. When I found it on Amazon.. I was thrilled and ordered it. However, I'm not too thrilled with it. The consistency is watery on this one.. whereas the one my beautician had was thick. Just to compare... I ordered one from the actual Olaplex website.. the price difference was only a couple dollars more and the product was thick and slightly different in color... it's the same as what my beautician used. I don't know if the one from Amazon was old or what... but it's definitely different from the other one. Even the way it works is different. It was worth the try... but I won't order it again from here :(",0
I like the color.,1
"I wanted these to work after reading both positive and negative reviews, unfortunately the negative reviews were spot on.  I have thick shoulder length hair, and these rollers don't curl, the clips don't work, and honestly my drug store set from 15 years ago surpasses these.  Completely disappointing.",0
"Dead Sea Essentials by Ahava Witch Hazel Hand Cream is one of the best hand creams I have tried in years.  With a very fragrant witch hazel scene, and a smooth silky texture. It is nice, smooth and creamy with a gentle witch hazel  scent. It leaves my hands soft and smooth after constant hand washing from working in a hospital setting and using hospital soap. It is nice and compact where I can take it in my purse. Is is free of Paragons and Phthalate which is good for me because I have very sensitive skin and easily reactive and irritable with too many chemicals. The first ingredient is water which is good makes it easily absorbed by the skin.",1
"I do not give 5 stars often, but this body wash has earned it.

I am a big fan of Billy Jealousy products and use them regularly. I have been using the Ocean Front body wash for some time and it works well. I decided to give this a try and I am never switching back. This body wash smells terrific, but isn't overpowering. This wash pours thick and suds incredibly well. I was used to the thin, low sudsing, Ocean Front and ended up using way too much, the first time around. You hardly need any of this product to wash yourself. The moisturizing is wonderful! It leaves your skin feeling lightly moisturized without feeling overly greasy. My skin is on the more sensitive side and I have had no reaction to this body wash.

I fear that Billy Jealousy will change this product once they figure out how little you need to use. I hope they do not because this is my new favorite body wash.",1
i love this product it works great and love the way my skin feels after i put it on.,1
awsome But its a little greecy but it makes your hair looks nice,1
good,1
"It's ok. It does not rip your face off the way the girl in the video filmed it. We had several family members try it here too and not one had an issue. It was really easy to get off. We tried it thin, heavy-- all the same results without pain. I actually wanted the rip off factor. I don't know if they changed the formula or what or if that girl had a crazy hairy face...",0
"Bought because it was recommended by - Allure, I think it was - as their favorite dry shampoo. Definitely lives up to the recommendation. Leaves a nice but not over-whelming scent, adds body, and doesn't leave any powder residue that I can see (I have dark hair so that would be a huge problem).

Sometimes I use it just at ther roots on clean hair to provide a little texture and lift. I find it works well for that, too. And no stickiness or other unpleasantness. Hair just smells and looks clean. Great for people like me who only shampoo every few days or so.",1
"Good conditioner, just not as good as it used to be. Guess nothing lasts forever.",1
The only face cleanser I use.,1
"I bought this from Ulta and am glad I saw it on here and for the exact same price because I'm definitely going to purchase this product again. It has worked for both my husband and I. He has sensitive skin but we both have normal to oily skin and get breakouts every once in a while. I've been using it for almost 5 months now and learned that it works best for me when I apply it immediately after I see a pimple appearing. It works on red bumps, and white heads however, I've had to get rid of the pus in the pimple (if any) to get it to dry the pimple out completely. I always applied it at night before bed and washed it off in the morning. It is really light and never wiped off on my bedsheets because once dried, it kind of 'sticks' to the skin until you rub it off.
Love this stuff! Super easy to use.",1
"This scent reminds me of this Hawaiian coconut suntan lotion my mom used to buy. Very nice tropical jasmine fragrance. I like it, it's feminine and clean smelling, no fake smelling musk ketones.",1
My skin foot didn't feel different,0
"Do not waste your money. This product did not work on my chest, arms or neck .Actually vaseline petroleum jelly works much better than crepe erase. and costs less!.",0
The best one,1
"I am in the process of growing my hair from a short bob to a medium and I LOVE this product.  I blow dry my hair until damp, section my hair and spray and blow dry each section straight!  Barely need to use the flat iron!!",1
"I purchased this brand of nail polish because it is ""5-free"". The color on the nails is pretty, a spring-ish pink, but when applied to the nail, it comes out streaky - almost like I'm painting my nails with white out (but not as ugly). I use RGB base coat, and then a top coat and the essie quick dry drops as I do with all other polishes, but this one just doesn't come out right.",0
I purchased quite a few of these and the eyeliner glides easily but is too soft.  It is so soft that you can literally pinch the liner to mold it into a point.  I have to sharpen the pencil or mold it to a point because it gets 'round' easily and applies a thick sloppy line.  This pencil is NOT WATERPROOF as advertised here.  It smears quickly from the oil on your skin or sweat.  I tried 'setting' it by applying primer first and also tried setting it with powder and eyeshadows and nothing works.  Definitely not to be used on the waterline.  That is one big smear within 15 minutes.  Very disappointed.,0
"This is an effective concealer.

In truth, have not experienced any of the extremely dramatic improvements that people
report.  Everyone detects imperfections in their skin, so a response to any skin care
product is going to be very individualized, and highly personal-right?

The ingredients are fairly ""natural"" and include shea butter, apricot,  cocoa and many
minerals.

To avoid any drying effect, moisturizer is applied on the cleansed skin first, then the
concealer.

Overall, I like this product. Although it comes with an applicator,  the ""tap-tap-tap""
gently with your fingertip approach seems to work better.  More control that way and
also use far less than the applicator-full.  This method allows a nice and subtle lighter
application of the make-up.

PROS:

- No irritation. Does not upset sensitive skin

- Easy to apply

- medium color works well

- long-lasting

- no heavy scent

--no heavy ""caking""

CONS:

-the major one is expense. $65 is very high for such a small amount.

At this point, still prefer Clinique Line Smoothing Concealer Light for Women.  Price $22
vs. $65 and results are good. Applicator has a light spongy-ness to it which allows fine
control.

RATING:

5: overall product

3: high cost

NET: 4.5, (not a choice) so 4 here.",1
"I can easily say the the Zwilling J.A. Henckels rotary ear and nose hair trimmer is the best thing out there. I have tried the battery powered, automatic trimmers for grooming and they have all been hard to use and most of them end up pulling out hairs and causing pain. The Zwilling is perfect in it's small size and basic operation. It might take a minute or two more to get the job done, but it is well worth it.
  The Twin S Nail Clipper that is included in this set is great because of its compact design, The blades are very sharp so they can cut through the thickest nails, but I would make sure to have a file handy because it will leave sharp edges. The only thing that would make these clippers perfect is if they had a lock to keep them closed so you could attach the to a key ring or something else to keep them close when you need them.
  While both of these products are great in their simplicity and functions, I do not see why anyone in their right mind would spend $99 on these items. I know that Zwilling makes phenomenal products especially when it comes to grooming, but there is nothing here to justify such a high price tag. I highly reccomend these products, but I do not recommend that anyone pay such an outrageous price for something this basic and simple.",1
"First off, the new kit contains less wax compared to the old kit. The amount of wax is ""okay"" if you only need to wax your face. I can see how a person could wax one leg with one kit.

The microwave method of heating the wax is so inferior to the old method of boiling on the stove in a pan of water. The microwave heats the wax unevenly and you have to constantly stir it as it heats. This is very messy and in your microwave and all over your kitchen. The wax cools down way too fast. The old kit was great. Once the wax was heated, it stayed warm in the tin cup until you were finished waxing.

I still do like the wax, but I will have to search for an alternative.",0
"I have lots of acne on my forehead and nose, and it severely dried out the bottom corners of my nose. VERY painful!! I just don't know how to make it work.",0
"Cool name. Nice handle. That's about it.

I wanted to try this (after my Conair BC171NCS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush's heating element stopped working after a year) since it was the highest rated product of its kind on Amazon but I was REALLY DISAPPOINTED.

I didn't really consider wattage when purchasing this but its ""Powerful 250 Watt"" is actually laughably puny next to the 1000 Watt Conair Hot Air Brush.

I also didn't like how easily it got stuck when I rolled it up in my hair. I think it's due to the unforgiving hard plastic bristles, compared to the Conair's flexible bristles.

Sending it back and going to try another Conair brush, which comes with THREE attachments and the Helen of Troy came with none.",0
"Mario Badescu has great products, this definitely works at reducing the appearance of whiteheads, blackheads...the only downside is the white powder gets very annoying as it gets all over your clothes. Definitely wash it off after it dries. Would recommend!",1
"Works well, super powerful pump so be careful not to apply too much!",1
"For an oil free product I find this sunscreen very oily, its not in a lotion form. Also I noticed that it started to break out my face so I stopped using it. I'm still looking for a product that works for me.",0
It works better than having no primer at all but I feel like it makes it hard to blend and it doesn't seem like my shadow stays completely put. This is the first primer I've tried so I have nothing to compare it to.,1
"I stopped using this mousse makeup about a year ago and switched to Elizabeth Arden creme makeup in a compact and applied with a sponge.  This summer with the heat, I returned to the mouse makeup because it is so light and feels so great on my skin.  Easy to apply with your fingertips. The shade is a little lighter than I thought because I thought it would be  a sunkissed blush (sparkling blush) .  I really miss the blush mousse makeup thay EA used to make but I am happy with this as a foundation.  I have light skin and stay out of the sun as much as possible so this shade is good for me.",1
Liked this product and would order it again!,1
the colour is red in tint,0
"The quality of the conditioner is average. This product has a strong scent, like an unpleasant perfume -- not something that you would expect for a leave-in conditioner.",0
I use the mouse normally. I thought this would be a nice alternative. Not. It streaks like crazy. I'm to the end of the tube and I never did get the hang of it.,0
I have noticed a slight improvement in dark circles under eyes.  Slight.  but that's better than nothing.  it's also very rich and creamy and no doubt will help with simple moisturizing of the skin under eyes and crow feet area,1
"I have very fine hair, I love the body it gives my hair. It lasts all day. If you want curls this isn't the size for you go smaller but perfect for full body. I also use a negative ionic blow dryer and bamboo wood brush so I have zero frizz with so much shine. My hair always looks like I just came from the hairdresser.  I purchased both on here the brush is "" Aisilk Wooden Bamboo. If you want to try! I love using the trio!",1
"Unlike most beauty products I have experience with, it actually does what it says it will do.",1
"I don't know if I received old product (tops were dented) or if it was adulterated, or if S&C is a poorly formulated product but this polish, and all my S&C products are really gummy, take forever to dry, bubble, and peel off in less than a day. Sigh.",0
"Sorry, but I don't like the smell and I get pimples on my scalp after using it.",0
Best hand lotion made. The only thing that heals cracked hands,1
Love the Mercur Razor and blades its the best quality heavy don't buy any cheaper razor or blade. It saves a fortune is disposable razors.,1
strong hold as long as you don't move your hair.,0
The wand is flimsy and the covering came off the tube immediately.,0
"It does work as described.  It takes off even the toughest mascara and eyeliner.  Unfortunately, it replaces the stuck-on-makeup with stuck-on-oily-gunk.  I guess if I used this and then washed my face with a washcloth before bed, it would be OK... however, I could never use this to ""fix"" a makeup mistake and head out the door.  The feeling of this on my eyes/face is too gross for me to leave the house with.",0
Don't bother buying the product.  Thought it was like a hairspray. The product lands up everywhere but not on your hair. It's not worth the price. Didn't receive an invoice so I can't return the product.,0
Good color and doesn't dry out my lips.,1
"Love this conditioner for reviving my red hair! Leaves it soft and manageable, and brightens up dull red hair!",1
"Love this product!  Very thorough cleanser, yet gentle for sensitive skin.",1
Great scent but left my hair a little limp compared to other products I've used.,1
"This product used to do miracles for me back a few years ago when I used to buy it from a local Planet Beauty (beauty supply store).  I decided to use it again and thought the price on here was great!  I used it maybe 3 times and I noticed that my hair was getting very dry and I did not see the same results that I did before.  I don't know if the formula changed but it was not the same.  It smelled the same.

"Not quite the color I was expecting. A good color to match a single outfit, but not to wear for 2 weeks. Would prefer it to have a browner undertone, than so orangey.",1
"I love LAFCO products. They all smell wonderful and my skin feels great. The low rating for this product comes from the fact that the pump spout was broken off and when delivered , the soap was spilled  in box so I lost about an ounce. The LAFCO lotion came separately and was well packaged.",0
Smells cheap,0
Leaked all over,0
I have been using this shampoo for 3 months and my hair has been flat and lifeless. I thought it was because I have been unable to color it. Not so. A wig specialist suggested I try Nioxin for thinning hair. I didn't realize how depressed I had been about my lifeless hair until I tried Nioxin. It gave my hair body and made if fluffy. Photo was a huge waste of my money. I bought the serum as well and have been using it for 3 months. I have not seen any new hair growth. Don't waste your money.,0

is not good cuality,0
I like that it stays on well and does not smear. The only negative is that it leaves a sticky feel on the eyelids.,1
Helps with my pimples!! Smell is strong with alcohol but worth it lol def notice how pimples stops hurtn over night even tho its not gone yet ! It does the job,1
I don't notice any difference.  I even did one hand with it and one hand without.  Save your money and just buy a base coat.,0

Color exactly as on a picture,1
"I am so happy to have found this product.  I am 55 who always made sure my hair was fixed daily. Loosing hair is so hard to handle.  I found this product and my hair looks thick.  Nobody realizes that my hair is falling out and is as thin as it is.  Don't know what I will do down the road but this makes the journey easier to take.  By the way...Bosley hair loss products...sold here on Amazon for better prices than hair salons, works good.  I have went from extreme hair loss to very minimal now.  I color my hair and there is a color treated formula. Make sure you leave conditioner on for a few minutes and give it 2 to 3 months for real results.  Makes a world of difference.",1
"I like the way this foundation feels on my skin.  I first got one of these from a dermatologist but when I ran out, I bought this on Amazon.  The foundation goes on best with a foundation brush in my opinion and it feels nice and cool on the skin.  Once it dries, I still fee like my skin can breathe with is great.  I didn't realize how little is in each package though and I don't think I will repurchase.  I usually only wear mineral foundation but put this on occasionally when I want more coverage for a night out.",1
Did not straighten my hair at all - and my hair even managed to get caught in the seams (and I have used straight irons forever). I promptly sent this back,0
I love this perfume!!,1
"I have been using Moroccanoil for years to calm my fine, frizzy hair.  After reading a few rave reviews for Davines Oi, I decided to give it a try instead of reordering the Moroccanoil, and let me say - this stuff is FABULOUS.  My coworkers thought I had had a salon appointment - my hair looked that good despite the fact that I have no hairdressing skills whatsoever and did nothing else different than usual to style my frizzy locks.  I washed and conditioned with Davines Love Smoothing Shampoo and Conditioner, which I had previously been using with the Moroccanoil.  I then rubbed 6 pumps of Oi into my shoulder length hair and let it air dry.  Finally, I went over it with my flat iron, as I do after every wash.  The Oi was the only new component of my routine, and for the first time in my life, I was able to style my hair so that it looked as nice as it does when I come from the salon.  I cannot recommend this product highly enough for people who have frizzy hair like mine!",1
"I really love OPI so I switched from Nailtiques to Envy. My nails which had grown so strong and lovely with Nailtiques grew out thin and flaked apart past the quick with Envy. Everyone is a little different, so maybe this will work for you. But for me it seemed to take months to heal the damage it caused.",0
I've been using this shampoo for about 7 years. It cleanses your hair and it helps to prevent thinning of your hair. Great price on Amazon. I had been paying $34-$38 retail price for this shampoo from my local beauty supply stores. I bought it recently on Amazon for $25.,1
I ordered this end of March and used it for a few days with no problem but had to stop because my eyes were suffering from what I thought was allergies.  Stopped it for several days and tried again with the same results.  There was lots of pollen so allergy eyes this time of year were normal for me.  Started up again-same results.  Used prescription eye medication and continued the Revita Lash for two more days.  Finally last week-gave up and went back to the doctor with severe inflammation and went on antibiotics for the eyes.  Finally cleared it up and was told not to use the stuff again-went to return it but of course-I was 4 days too late to return it.  It's not fair since the reaction to this product is the same as you would have for regular allergies until it gets real severe.  Im sure they count on you running out of time.,0
"I love Jane Iredale pressed mineral foundation.  They have a good variety of colors and have a shade I wear in Fall/Winter and into early Spring and I wear a darker shade in the Summer.  I have very sensitive skin the breaks out easily and I love that this foundation never breaks me out.  Also, you can apply lightly using a brush or can get better coverage applying with the sponge.",1
Super surprised ! Is a great find and now part of my morning routine.,1
"This leaves my hair with some kind of filmy, greasy stuff on it. I hate this stuff. Will not be buying again. Funny thing is, I bought this brand from my hairdresser, and it didn't do that.

If I could give it zero stars, I would.",0
Does the job. Really well.,1
"I ordered this when I purchased the Paul Mitchell purple shampoo. As other reviews have noted, the color of the conditioner isn't purple like the shampoo, it's a grey-ish/lavendar color. I like it, though. My hair is soft after I use it. Smells great, too! I haven't noticed any fading in my blonde, so that means it's doing its job!",1
"I don't know how I'm going to enjoy the 24 Karat gold color, since when I opened my package, it was not sealed and it looks like someone used it right before shipping it out to me. So I'm pretty upset. I don't have any time to return this item either and since it's an add on item, I'm not sure I could even get it replaced without spending another $25.

As for the teal color (lagoon) it arrived in a sealed plastic, like all eyeliner cosmetics should and the color is true to the picture.

It glides on easy and it's smooth. I can't wait to test how waterproof it is.",0
I like to use this perfume on me. It's mild and gentle and won't bother baby if I wear it.,1
super base coat,1
Great Color but Chips very quickly.,0
I really like this eye cream. It is highly moisturizing and I just started using it and will come back to update this review in a few weeks.  A little goes a long way with this cream.  I was using Boots No. 7 eye cream which I am really happy with and is a fraction of the price.  I am hoping to see some great results from this cream and will update this review.,1
"The product is good. Very good, I would suggest giving it a try.
Product was leaking in box on delivery.",0
"davines makes great products, this one is good but i use their blue one too and its better for my hair whicj is straight fine and bleached",1
Love this curling iron. Much better than the others I've used and I actually enjoy curling my hair now. Reasonably priced and I love it!,1
More convenient and less messy than loose Bare Minerals. Coverage is light but can use a concealer brush to apply a thicker layer to disguise blemishes and/or dark spots.,1
"I am a fan. However, I dropped the old one in the shower after a year or so of use, and it broke in a way that was not fixable. Sad! I have since purchased a new one, but I do wish there were some kind of warranty on it. I thought it would last much longer.",1
"Got this colour to do my mother's nails, the colour shown here is true to what it looks like on.",1
This is NOT the real product. I bought this bottle as a replacement and it is clearly different from the real relaxing balm. It functions about half as well.,0
Irritated my skin (I usually don't have sensitivity to products). Pretty sure any minor wrinkles I had look worse.,0
my husband LOVES this oil for his face.,1
"I bought this, even though it was a little more expensive because it got great reviews.  I was disappointed because the light is a little too dark for me.  I do not think any of the reviews were for the light so maybe the darker colors are okay.  The coverage is fine, I just think light should be lighter.",0
I got this in my Ipsy bag and I love the color but it breaks so much! I'll get halfway done and a huge chunk will break off :( will buy this color again but in a different brand,0
Great lubrication for the razor... so says my boyfriend :),1
"Does the job, but itches some.",1
Returned... did not work for me,0
"We use this all the time. Some people complain the color is green. It is until you wash it off. Put it on, leave it in for a couple of hours or overnight, then shower and your tan.
To all the people that say it's green...just follow directions. Duh",1
I love the color!  Great everyday polish.,1
I'm intrigued by this product. Makes me feel very Frenchie by spraying 'refreshing' water on me and the fact watching TJ Miller using this as his ending joke... makes me want to kinda get it. Though 15$ for Nitrogen and water.... bajesus!,1
It was okay I was sad because thee result brushing it seeing if gonna make my teeth whiten but it didn't so yeah!,0
I like the way after I use this product my skin feels so very soft and clean.  I recommand this product to everyone.,1
"The same day i received this product, i plugged it in for 1st use. I smelled plastic burning so i unplugged it and saw that the plastic had melted over the plates. It was completely defective. I contacted the seller and he insisted that i replaced the new one he sent me with one i had already owned. He emailed me a few very vulgar nasty emails so i filed a complaint with amazon and am still awaiting a refund!",0
Works well and smells amazing! You only have to use a small amount to cover all of your hair.,1
"I would do anything for an excellent shampoo conditioner, pay basically any price.  On paper this looked good.  High quality, a lack of all the wrong (or right) chemicals and high reviews.  Unfortunately it STINKS.  The smell actually nauseates me a little.  I have on occasion used the shampoo, only to cover it up with a better selling conditioner.  On it's own, it's so bad that if I wash my hair before I got sleep, the smell makes it hard to go to sleep.  Overall, if I hate it this much, I can't imagine what the people around me think.  Many people seem to like the smell, but I truly hate it.",0
Good product,1
"I try other perfumes but I keep coming back to this one. It seems like there are so many perfumes that have similar scents, but this one is unique.",1
Color looks different online vs in person,0
Product wasn't sealed.  Smells like calamine lotion.  Buyer beware,0
"I adore this palette, the colors are very buttery smooth and go on effortlessly. I use it with a UD primer and the combination works amazing for my oily lids. Staple for getting ready day to day or going out.",1
I started using this from a sample on vacation and watched some deep as well as fine wrinkles start to visibly diminish.,1
"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1
Not sure how this even supposed to work.  No effect whatsoever.  Maybe it's just me.,0
"Magic Potion! Cleared my baby's acne in 10 days when all other ""remedies"" failed",1
"Same thing here.  Texture is good, but saw no visible effects.  Ended up clogging my pores as well.",0
"Have used this product for many years.  This one had apparently been bought and returned - and resold to me.  Product was runny, not the paste consistency it should have been",0
THE best face wash for my face.  This stuff works well and the aloe vera keeps your face from over drying.  Great stuff!!!,1
"This item was returned immediately. I own a salon and we needed a new dryer. This same model was available at a professional supply store but found it here much cheaper. Not worth it! After 5 minutes of use, it blew out power to the entire surge protector. To solve this problem, we plugged it into an entirely different outlet. A new issue arose. After a few minutes of use, the plug itself became to hot to touch. I do not recommend this dryer for professional or home use.",0
did not work as advertised,0
I purchased ADEL in the pictures it is a light grey in reality it is white. I put a drop on a white piece of paper and it blended in. Not at all as pictured or what I wanted.,0
Feels amazing on your face! So gentle,1
Butter is a high end nail polish that has a price tag to match...what a rip off!!! after only TWO days -- it chips -- take my advice and avoid this high priced low quality crap!,0
I love it as a highlighter and eye shadow.,1
Tried this but it does not do a good job cleaning and leads to clogged pores and breakouts. Loreal (youth code foaming gel) makes a great product which is cheaper and cleans much better. I would not recommend this product.,0
My daughter and granddaughter both asked for this for birthday gifts...,1
Its come to me broken as you can see,0
"I paid three times the price for these gloves compared to another pair because they were called ""MenScience"" gloves. I figured if they were for ""Men"" they would be a larger size. Not so. In fact they are smaller than the other pair I bought. These gloves are tiny. They stretch to fit to a certain degree. But they are way too tight on my hands. Don't be fooled by the ""Men"" label. I mean no disrespect for small folk, but these should be labeled ""LeprechaunScience"" gloves.

I will be returning them.

EDIT: 7/21 OK, I used the other gloves this morning. The ones that were larger than this brand. They too were small, but not as small. A tight fit on my hands, but they loosened up a bit when wet and soapy.  I suppose the MenScience gloves would too. But still, they are not for big hands.",0
NO NOTICEABLE CHANGE.,0
It took a while to get my flat iron. The sellers took care of the issue very quickly. I am very happy with there service. On top of that I love the flat iron. It was exactly as other reviewers said it to be. It straightens my hair well and it was affordable.,1
"I have naturally curly hair and am always looking for shampoos designed for curly hair. I decided to try Ouidad PlayCurl because I'd had good results with Ouidad Water Works. Unfortunately, I didn't see anything special with PlayCurl. I get similar, or better, results using Paul Mitchell shampoos, which are much cheaper.",0
smells good and works for my cuticles.,1
"For the price, its pretty good. Sadly, I had a different brands rosewater toning spritz before this and was extremely impressed with it, so the Badescu spray paled in comparison. It is very refreshing though, and smells heavenly.",1
"This is a fantastic hair styling tool.  I have long hair and I wanted to add body with a bit of curl to my ends.  This fit the bill perfectly.  Not only did I get the look I wanted, but it lasted for three days with minimal touch ups to the front of my hair (long bangs).  Hot Tools is a fantastic brand and I am sure I will be using this curling iron for years to come.",1
This conditioner smells terrible and doesn't do anything for my hair.  It's definitely been tampered with.  Never buy this product from Beauty it is.,0
This product is not TANGLE FREE I would not recommend for young girls or long hair. Otherwise i love it,1
"Used it a couple of times, its a conditioner but I still have flyaways, uuggggg....",1
Does not not work.,0
Not sure if it's original Kenneth Cole product or a rip off. Doesn't seem to have the same fragrance as the one's I purchased from Macy's.,0
"love the smell,fast deliery",1
"I have a hard time using this product just because I don't have experience curling my hair!  However, the tool itself seems to be pretty good.  Just make sure if you have straight hair like me, you use hair spray to keep the curls, otherwise they disappear quite easily.",1
quit spraying after two uses,0
Too light. Barely shows up so its pretty useless.,0
I like the convenience of  having it show up on my porch!,1
"It's alright.  I expected it to last all day but I have to reapply during the day, especially after I eat.",1
"I love these hot rollers!  I wish there were more of the larger sizeb but other than that, they are great, they warm up quickly,easy to store and are great for travel!",1
"I love the product, but when it arrived, half was out of the container. It was a big mess.
I've contacted them asking that the give me a small credit or an 8oz bottle of the shampoo to make up for the spillage.
I've been given the run around and no luck.  I'm really disappointed.",0
The product burnt my and my spouse's skin and we had to rush to the urgent care. It took almost 7 days to get back to normal... It's  horrible product and the customer service didn't seem to be bothered about it at all. They refunded my purchase but what about the inconvenience that it caused?,0
does not work at all,0
"Love this so far. I like the little black hinge on it that is meant to be used as a stand. My previous wand did not have that and i always had to be careful setting it down on counters/other things to not leave a burn mark. I had to use a mat so i didn't mess up my counters, but now with the little stand i don't need to. I was worried about my hair getting caught in it, but it doesnt. Heats up quickly and is comfortable to use.",1
Loved the color but when my tech did my nails the polish wrinkled under the UV lamp on a few nails.  I had to take it off and use a similar color the salon had.  I've used CND products before and have never had a problem so I'm a little disappointed.,0
I have purple hair and this unfortunately leaves white flakes in my hair. I even tried brushing it out with a boar brush and the white flakes still won't disappear.,0
"I have sagging skin under my chin and fine lines. I hate it. I tried many products, some work a bit, some don't work at all. Everyone promises things, but they are just promises. I tried natural oils as well. I figure let me give product a try. The roll is made very well, and as you roll this thing, you press slightly on the tube and the product comes out. It dried pretty fast and seemed to have absorbed well. My fine lines almost instantly disappeared. It physically seemed to have tightened the skin... yet you don't feel a tightness. So you do feel comfortable. The saggy skin is not much affected though.
Long term effects, i don't believe this is a cure.",1
It is wonderful!,1
"I really like the product, but it's expensive.",1
"Unfortunately, this product did not help reduce my acne. I had used it twice a day. Once at night with my hands and warm water and again in the morning in the shower using a warm wash cloth. I used the product till the bottle was almost empty. I was very disappointed :(",0
"Smells awful, like musty water.  I don't feel comfortable using it do to the smell.",0
"Haven't noticed any dramatic changes, but have only used this product twice a week in about 4, as suggested.",0
Great product.,1
"I bought this about a year ago and I thought I had been very happy with it. I had had a Bosley transplant many years ago and thought this would be a good product to try. Seemed to work well. A year later I did get a fungal seboric dermatitus problem on my scalp which was/is a nightmare. I am not saying this shampoo caused the problem but I think the absence of it being an ""anti-dandruff shampoo"" or ""helps with semoboric dermatitus"", or ""being an antifungal shampoo"" means that its is lacking certain ingredients necccessary to keep under control these problems or the potential for these problems. After my first transplant Bosley told me to use Nutrigina T-Gel shampoo which does have seboric dermatitus fighting properties so I am pretty sure a good medicated shampoo is a good thing to use with everyone. So I gave it 2 stars because it is not even a dandruff fighting shampoo at a minimum. I think everyone at minimum should have a antidandruff shampoo not just a ""nourishing shampoo"" which could just be nice sounding marketing words. I should have noticed that dandruff fighing was missing from the product description.",0
"I love this scent, but when purchased here, the scent seems to wear off quickly, making me wonder if I received a counterfeit or watered down product. I will buy this full price at Macy's, would rather be sure of my purchase as opposed to just buying it at the lowest cost.",0
I have been using CND for a few years and usually like it but this color Does not stay on nails well at all...peels off very easily. Not a good purchase,0
"I did my homework on this, looked around for a good while on a good razor. The company has been around for a long time, and they make a lot of good products. This razor is the one that suited me. It works great! Very well made durable. This will be the last razor you'll ever buy.",1
"This is a great smelling product however, you are told the shipping is no longer than 7 to 10 days. When in reality it is 3 weeks.",0
"if you have sensitive skin, this is a great cleanser.",1
ck is flowery with a dash of herbal essence. ck is for men or women so I made my husband try a little and he was--into the shower! In no way did he (or me) see this as a man's scent. I am particular about my perfume and often make note when someone walks by with a scent I enjoy. And although I did like ck it doesn't draw the same response as other perfumes I wear. I gave it four starts because I really liked the scent. It is fresh and clean not heavy like some. It is worth the money.,1
Has a different smell. Which I don't like,0
"This is the worst mat moisturizer ever. I have the worse oily skin, this product feels heavy and after 1 hour my skin becomes extra oily! Do not buy if your skin is super oily. Try Bioderma or Avene instead.",0
Strong scent.  Works great on hair.  Package leaks everywhere,0
"I bought this thinking that I was going to get a full coverage glitter nail polish; from the way it looks in the bottle, that is what you would think. I was so excited when I got home to try it... when I put on the first coat I was very disappointed: hardly any glitter at all. It took FIVE coats to get the look I wanted. :(

If you are looking for full coverage glitter, check out Sally Hansen's new Gem Crush colors. Complete full coverage with 2 coats!",0
I found this to be messy and did not work as well as spray on cover does. It is hard to apply exactly where you want it.,0
"There are times when my bangs look oily after just a day or two after shampooing, and this dry shampoo helps me put off shampooing until it's convenient.",1
Excellent,1
Supergoop and all their products have been my go to sunscreen for years. I use it every day. I like to use the spray for my hair and scalp. People tend to forget that our hair needs protection too.,1
"i didn't really notice a difference if i did or did not use this, but if your skin reacts to salicylic  acid, then it might work for you",0
Didn't smell anything like the one in the store. Its just sitting on a stand. Willl not use. Don't waste your money.,0
good price..came in timely and love the product...just changed from doing my own acrylic nails..which was a pain..and started using this with a UV light plus a shellac base and top coat...it seems to stay for at least two weeks...soo I'm happy,1
"I didn't like this shampoo. It's too liquidy, just like water. Half if what you pour into your hand ends up in tge bathroom's floor.",0
"The first time I received the foundation, I noticed a tear inside the bottle. The clear part of the mixture was spilling out a little. I thought it must have cracked from the shipping process.  I used it and because of the tear, the consistency was off.  Before I know it, I received my 2nd month supply since I'm on the monthly subscription. Same problem! I just received my 3rd bottle, same defect! I don't think it's a shipping problem. I'm canceling my subscription and getting a refund on my 3rd order.",0
"Given the fact that this product was so widely recommended for oily skin, I thought I'd give it a shot. Big mistake. This product made my skin extremely sensitive to the sun, and I started getting red blotches on the sides of my cheeks, and near my temple area. I was quite alarmed, and have discontinued use. It's not something you should use on sensitive skin!",0
"when I use this product, I don't need to use foundation.  It provides moisturizer and sun screen protection too.  The best of both world.",1
"This color is a little lighter than I expected.  I probably wouldn't have bought it had I known, but I do still like it",1
The soy candle is beautiful and the fragrance throw is good. The fragrance is gardenia and it smells so nice.,1
"it fell apart on the first use at the seems, works great otherwise for applying tanning mousse, much better than your hands.",0
"I love this product, it works great at hiding the thinning areas and it leaves hair feeling like hair should feel, very easy to brush also!!!
I've used other products in the past but toppik is by far the best!!!",1
"I received this hair dryer as a Christmas present this year.  I used the hair dryer about three times in two months.  Went to plug it in this week, and it won't turn on.  I've tried to turn it on in different outlets throughout the house, still won't work.  My previous hair dryer probably cost $20.00 and I bought it 15 years ago.  It still works!  This $130.00 hair dryer stopped working after three uses!  Contacted the Chi Customer Service today and, of course, it's a HUGE hassle to get it replaced!!  I find it a waste of money to buy products from companies that won't support their product if something goes wrong!",0
It was damaged when I receive it.,0
"I dislike the tacky feeling of sunscreen & the white tint it leaves behind. By contrast, this product is a real pleasure to wear! I purchased it after I got a few samples from my dermatologist.

Amazing product, but unfortunately the pump didn't work, not even once. It's a huge waste of my time to have to return it for a refund - printing labels, getting boxes, etc. I wish it just worked as expected.",0
"Got a sample of this from Neiman Marcus and took it to the gym. It's so runny, you have to use a ton to feel like you're covering your hair. Even then it doesn't lather so you don't know for sure that your hair is getting clean. Some dripped into my eye and stung terribly. I wouldn't use this shampoo if given a free lifetime supply. Terrible product.",0
"I have been using the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special ""Cleanse"" shampoo for years. I would purchase at a local Paul Mitchell authorized salon. The experience that you get when using this shampoo is an invigorating ""tingling"" sensation on your scalp. This 33.8 oz bottle did not have the word ""cleanse"" on it, yet that is what I thought I ordered, but more importantly it did not have the tingling sensation when used. I understand there are many knock offs (fakes) of this shampoo so I emailed the company with my concern but received no response from them. Why would they not respond? Is this product a fake? I am not going so far as to accuse them of it not being the real Paul Mithchell product but I am suspicious if the product does not perform like the reall product and they did not respond to my email. This is a quote from legal zoom.com
""Despite their phenomenal success, De Joria and Mitchell continue to face business challenges. The brand they've worked hard to build is now under attack from bootleggers. Online stores, beauty supply companies and even large retail chains have been inundated with ""look-alike"" products and knockoffs. De Joria estimates that bootlegging costs the company millions in revenue each year. Besides lost revenue, off-market products could cost the company something even more important: its reputation for quality. De Joria says that the knockoffs would not give customers the same results as authentic Paul Mitchell products, even though they may look the same.

The problem has become so pervasive that the company has launched an anti-bootleg campaign online and on TV. In the ads, John Paul De Joria warns consumers that if the product didn't come from a Paul Mitchell salon, it is not the real thing.""

 Caveat Emptor!",0
"This is so handy! It's really funny to use, it makes me laugh because I look ridiculous. But It works great. My hands are free to work on my computer while my hair dries. I tried it with rollers and pin curls. I love the fullness I get with this and smooth hair. I took off a star because it comes disconnected in use. Unless I sit just right, the hose wants to pop off of the cap so I have to put it back on. This is slightly annoying. But it's a cheap and easy way to dry and style my hair hands-free, so I can deal with that.",1
"This mascara is great if you want your eyelashes to look like giant black caterpillars. I have tried and tired to like it, to sort out the wand,  to make myself like it.... no go.",0
"I love the consistency and it really helps to hydrate the skin. My problem, however, is that it broke me out. I have my skin care down to a science after 15 yrs of acne. So when I broke out after 3 yrs of good skin i immediately returned the product. It was wonderful otherwise.",0
nice,1
"I was really excited to use this product, I adore other products from this brand. I have dry skin and occational eczema break outs and I was hoping this would be gentle enough for me......WRONG! This product, as great as it smells, has caused horrible dry flakey eczema patches on my  face. Super irritating and drying and doesn't seem to cleanse well either.",0
Fake product that dried out in about a month and no longer even works. Waste of money!,0
"Not what i expected ......
Very disappointed",0
Not the real thing!,0
The color looks fresh and clean.,1
The product was water not getl. I have used Talika Lipocils for months and it is a gel!. I have sent this product back and the vendor has agreed to a credit.,0
Luxurious feeling lather. Love the scent. Only downside is it's on the expensive end of shaving creams.,1
I am so tired of purchasing this Rusk W8Less Hairspray from Amazon.  I've never had one full can work properly.  They spray for a while and then just quit spraying.  I just received this order of 3 cans of hairspray.  Used the first can this morning and it already quit working.  This is unacceptable.,0
"Ordered Sensories Purify Cucurbita Tea Tree Shampoo and received item.  It leaked in the box and the Shampoo is visibiliy faded and lacks the fresh scent/odor that makes this shampoo unique.
 Would like a pre-paid return shipping label and guarantee they will refund my original shipping costs!",0
Just love this polish!!  No one can tell when my nails grow out!,1
Been using it dauly for 2 months...Doesn't seem to work for me very well.,0
This is a great nail strengthener!,1
"I wonder if this product is new, when I opened the box for the first time, the device is not as clean as new. There is a black marker pen marking on the silver roller and the on/off button is yellowish color.",0
"I have used this before and loved it. My face has been breaking out more than normal lately, so I decided to come check the reviews because on here ... clearly it seems the ingredients with frangrance & dyes are no good for me either  :(",0
I absolutely love this highlighter.  It contours beautifully and I am in my late 60's.  It goes on like silk and I have gotten a lot of compliments. I have used other highlighters and no one has ever noticed.  You don't need much for it to show and it stays on all day.,1
I always buy this product. It works for my hair.,1
Works good but contains formaldehyde.,0
excellet,1
I love OSMOSIS products but their lip line tends to be somewhat orange hued. It doesn't look that great on my skin tone. I am not happy with this.,0
"I liked the finish when I first put this on, but after about an hour, my pores looked like iridescent craters!
Also, this will not work on very fair skin as actually too much color and conversely, will not work on dark complexions too well without ghosting.
It's a shame, because I liked the ingredients in this, and also the initial look, satin matte.",0
"This pomade did not hold up at all for me. I would apply with damp hair, comb it to spread it evenly, and style. It dries kinda crunchy, and if you finger comb it or have to restyle it pulls pretty bad and creates stubborn stray hairs to pop up out of no where.

I give it two stars because it does end up leaving a matte finish and because of the scent. Also, as advertised, you can restyle with just a little water. But then you have the same problem as before with it just drying hard in your hair and ultimately losing its hold.

It just requires way too much maintenance to keep a fairly simple hairstyle in check.",0
Seriously? Worst top coat I have ever used... colored polish was dried completely for 24 hours... smeared and ruined my paint job! Shouldn't even get 1 star... pretty sad that Dollar Tree top coat is better than this!,0
Fast shipping and smells great,1
"This makes pretty waves, but I don't see what is so special about it. Definitely not worth the price. You're just paying for the label.",0
awesome,1
Superb balance and proper angle of attack.,1
I was surprised to see this primer was colored but it didn't bother me . I used my serum then my moisturizer and then I read on the back this has non chemical uva uvb sunscreen .. once I saw the color on it I just put a little setting powder over my face and did a little eye look and was out the door .,1
"I've used a number of AHAVA products and I don't think they are worth the packaging they're sent in. There really is nothing exceptional about Dead Sea minerals or mud, and its not worth the cost to human lives by buying AHAVA products, since they use Palestinian resources that are illegally appropriated, according to international law, and as recognized by the United Nations.",0
Too messy!,0
Helps keep my ginger hair vibrant for the weeks after coloring!,1
"I got my first acne scar right after using this on a pimple. While I'm not sure that they're correlated, I've had a few acne scars since, and they've only been right where I used this product.",0
It doesn't do anything for me. I had a couple of samples that worked wonders so I wonder if this is fake stuff.,0
Smell funny & gives your hair dull look.,0
"Seems fake, manufacturer is cutting edge internatioal llc not mario badescu, is it generic or plain fake? Not happy",0
"In terms of blemishes this seems to work best when combined with the Juice Beauty Wash. Using them together my daughter's red tone in her face has been reduced. She has moderate acne - and this often results in her face appearing ""red"". Used together the Juice Beauty cleanser and mask work to keep the acne to a minimum. They do not eliminate it for her - but it is reduced and what is there seems less deep and smaller in size.

We have always used masks as topical acne medicine and this one was no exception. Our favorite mask is the one from Pro Activ (though none of their other products works for us...the mask is the one we've continued to buy) and this Juice Beauty works almost as well. It will clear a blemish if left on for an hour or two but it requires a couple of go rounds to do so. Still - the fact it is more natural, much better scent, and that it works so well with the cleanser means these will be repeat purchases in our household.",1
works pretty well. only downsize is makes hair hard in the area applied. good product over all.,1
I really like this stuff.  It smells fantastic.  It lathers nicely and feels great on my skin.  I really enjoy shaving with a safety razor and really like this stuff.,1
"Seems fine for my sensitive skin, but I don't like the smell. If it was fragrance free I might rate it better.",0
Best blow dryer ever!! Saves me a lot of time. Love it,1
I like this but not I tried something similar in the same brand and I liked it better,0
I think thats very BAD FOR MY HAIR! I want to give back.,0
"I hate this product.  It makes my hair feel dry and coated.  I used to love Matrix, but this new line rots.  This is the 3rd product I have tried and they are all so drying.  bring back the old line!!!",0
"As described, brand new, cost is much less than the local cosmetologist charges.  I am a repeat buyer and will buy it again",1
Bought because I have used the rose plumping gloss that was a sample. This product seemed too thick & it didn't seem to have enough product in it,0
"Tried this out due to all the good reviews. I have dark hair and this DOES leave a slight powdery residue. It smells really nice but personally did not work as well as another brand I've tried before. Halfway through the day my hair felt like it had buildup and when running my fingers through it, I'd get the powdery stuff on my hands.",0
Love it,1
I love Lacoste Essential cologne. I also love getting the large size bottle for $20. Which is cheaper then when I saw it at duty-free while visiting Mexico. Win-win!,1
Good ingredients but very drying.  Made my normally oily skin very tough even with nightly shea butter treatmemt.  Leaves a whitcast and don't know that it protected me from sun very well.  Will not buy again.,0
I love Zoya's nail. It's less chemical and last longer.,1
I have very dry skin and this product is awesome.......just enough moisture.......doesn't make face oily like some products do.  I had used the Absolute Moisturizer & found it was just not enough moisture for my skin.  This one is perfect,1
Theres's a cap inside the tube!!!!! Im writting an email to Marvis as well to complain! So unprofessional!,0
"I was very excited about this product but every time I use it my curls only last for a couple of hours. I use curling iron spray and it works great with the other curler but for some reason these curls don't last that long. However, as long as the curls last they are gorgeous and the iron itself is very high quality.",1
"When I was reading reviews for the popular Glycolix 10% and 20% GA pads and trying to decide which concentration to buy, for some reason the 15% didn't immediately come up in the product listing and also had the fewest reviews. I ended up going with the 15%, reasoning that if this concentration was too strong I would use them less frequently or just wash my face 10 minutes after application until my skin could tolerate them. But as it happened, the 15% were just right for me and I've been using them every night for a few weeks and have started to see some improvements in my skin tone. I have dry skin and somewhat larger pores on my nose, but otherwise no acne or other real skin problems.

How I use them: every night after washing my face, I pat it dry and then wipe one Glycolix pad over the skin of my face and neck and upper chest. There is enough product in each wipe to cover that much area and then some. I avoid my eyelids and the area between my nose and upper lip (the skin there is just a bit too sensitive on my face) but I do my entire neck, top to bottom and ear to ear, and my chest to the same point you might see if wearing a v-neck t-shirt. I do not wash it off afterwards. I do sometimes wait 30 minutes or so and then add some moisturizer or coconut oil over the drier parts of my face. And then I go to bed, so it stays on as well as anything can overnight. In the morning I wash my face in the shower, then moisturize and also put on a strong sunscreen (I use&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neutrogena-Ultra-Sheer-Liquid-Sunblock-SPF-70-1-4-Ounce/dp/B0038ZXYP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Liquid Sunblock, SPF 70, 1.4 Ounce</a>).

The short term results have been really smooth skin, and this is most noticeable on my neck and chest, where I've never exfoliated or really done any skin maintenance. It tingles and itches going on those areas (still does, even after 3 weeks) and the skin has become very, very smooth - like baby-smooth. My face also became a bit softer and smoother, but since I've exfoliated it pretty regularly over the years, the difference wasn't as pronounced.

The 3 week results have been a very gradual smoothing of the freckles and other dark spots on my skin, a very slight fading. I can still see the pores on my nose, but my makeup has been going on smoother and the skin looks silkier and more glowing. It's about the same effect that having a professional facial gives me, only I have this effect every day now and not just the day or two after the facial. That's pretty cool, since I pay about $60 or more for a facial and a third that for these pads.

I haven't had any irritation, though I have noticed some dry skin flaking on my cheeks and the sides of my nose - this is the ""peel"" part of the acid, not a true peel where large amounts of skin come off as they do when you have a sunburn or serious chemical peel at the dermatologist, but just small amounts of surface cells being shed. A good moisturizer helps.

I think I'm going to use the 15% for another month, then buy the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Topix-Glycolix-Elite-Treatment-Pads-20-60-Pads/dp/B00080DNUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Topix Glycolix Elite Treatment Pads 20% 60 Pads</a>&nbsp;for my face and continue using the 15% for my neck and chest. I highly recommend this product as something inexpensive but really effective, and the batch I got is the real deal.",1
"It smells great, a little goes a long away, and makes my hair feel very clean. Love it!",1
Works well eyelashes don't fall out just keep growing !,1
"Eliminates static, makes hair feel silky, shiny, thicker and doesn't weight down my fine hair.  I use it year round.",1
This makes me so bronzy I LOVE it! Would definitely repurchase,1
"If I could give it less than 1 star I would.  DO NOT BUY ON AMAZON.  THEY ARE ALL FAKE.
Clarisonic will not honor the warranty should something go wrong.  Spend the extra $20 and get it at an authorized retailer.",0
"I bought this item, First time using it the tap where the cream comes out is busted. I had to open the bottle up and use my fingers. I really like this product but I hope next time it's not broken.",0
I had two of them for my wife and the power cord has separated on both of them so they no longer work.  Impossible to fix.,0
I like it but it has a slight smell  but it makes my skin soft,1
"Nice color but a little too light for me.  It has sparkles in it too, which I did not know.  U might like and u might not.",0
The BEST wipes!!!  Smells great....HIGHLY recommended  These are THE BEST WIPES!!!!  Love them!!!!,1
Product arrived when promised and I absolutely love it!,1
"Not the real thing.. I've used the real product for about 3 years now.  This is not it.  They may have filled empty bottles with some other product... it does not look or smell like the real product.  The color is a milky color, the smell isn't bad but it's not great either.  I used this product and it did add volume but my hair didn't feel as soft,  almost like the product wouldn't wash out and left a dense film layer on my hair.",0
"Fortunately I bought mine at a store that takes returns regardless of the time purchased.  I returned mine after using it for about a year.  I saw no improvement despite using it regularly.  It's an expensive gadget that takes time and effort which I willingly put in thinking it would work.  Not so.  I saw no difference in my skin, sorry to say.",0
I have had nothing but problems with this polish. It's streaky no matter how many coats or how much Seche top coat I use. It's super pretty and makes me sad that the formula is so crappy.,0
We used this on our whole family and spent the day at the beach. We reapplied as recommended and we all still got very sunburnt. Very disappointed!,0
Love it,1
It's great!,1
"Honestly,  it's just ok.",0
Awesome communication ,1
Smell good but it only last for like an hour don't like that cause most of the perfumes last at least 4 to 6 hours don't know is it fate but I don't recommend this product,0
Works but I do have to try multiple times to get it right. This is the only way I've been able to pull off a top bun... EVER. So kuddos to the inventor.,1
I returned it dried quickly but it did not leave your hair silky and shinny it kind of damage your hair I changed it for the T3 tourmaline top of the line as it's great,0
This skin firming product provides a smooth even result.,1
"I am absolutely in love with this scent. It has a smell that I have a very hard time describing but is sooooo gorgeous. The amber woods and musk really stay on your skin for a long time, too! I put this on my wrists and behind my ears immediately when I got it late afternoon and could still smell it the next morning before my shower. This is my go-to perfume now.",1
Very good product,1
I love the almond like smell it has.,1
" the best straightener you will ever purchase!
  Had one prior for 10 years!!!",1
"I've only had one experience using these razor blades, but they were very effective and it was easy to load them into the razor. I'll definitely refill my razor with these.",1
"I've purchased this dryer multiple times because I love how it works.  Unfortunately, the heat stopped working 8 months after I purchased it.  I'm super disappointed. :(",0
"Everyone who visits our office loves our soap - it is pleasant-smelling and creates a nice lather, without being too soapy.",1
"Never used this product before, but like the green tea, calls the skin.",1
"We've been trying to cut out as many chemicals in our products used at home, so we decided to try this. It smells nice, the consistency was odd, but rubbed in well and didn't seem to leave much greasy residue. We were in the sun at the beach for a few hours, reapplied every hour or directly after being in the water and my husband and I are both completely burnt. I will not be using this product again and am extremely disappointed that I bought two tubes.",0
After using for 4 months The only results that I have is that the hair is takes much longee time to grow. Very disappointed with this product.,0
"No me agrad para nada, es gigante, no tiene nada que ver con lo que me ofrecieron, perd mi dinero.",0
"I live in Southern California, and a couple of years ago I began to notice that the back of my head was getting sunburned even though, to all intents and purposes, I had plenty of hair back there. It took walking beneath one of those damnable video cameras in a grocery store to realize that the camera was seeing what I couldn't (or wouldn't!), to wit: I was slowly but surely getting a bald spot. Partially out of vanity, partially to protect the little solar panel on the back of my noggin, and partially because I'm a member of Amazon's VINE program and used to get free stuff, I started using various topical fibers like this, and I have to say that Toppik is one of the best if not THE best I have encountered. It goes on easily, blends perfectly with my (winter-fall) hair color, and most importantly of all, doesn't really come off until you swim or wash your hair. An ordinary, brief ""water only"" shower will actually not much effect it, so you can probably count on a good application lasting 48 hours if you're lucky. If not, this tiny bottle is small enough to carry anywhere, in anything.

The only real drawback is that it remains in its loose, powdery state for some time after the initial application, so lying on white sheets, pillows, or using a headrest will cause you to make a mark reminiscent of Martin Frasier on that episode of ""Frasier"" where he dyes his hair and then leaves a stain on the back of the armchair he's sitting in. Which is hilarious to watch happen on TV, but less so when you're explaining it to the chick you just hooked up with after a romp on those hotel sheets. I think the excuse I used was ""I was cleaning the chimney so my hair must be dirty"" and believe me, that sort of lie is worse than the truth.

Anyway, this stuff is very good, if a tad overpriced for the tiny amount, and as long as you remember to use it on dry or mostly dry hair and then work it in a little with a comb or brush, you'll be covered. No pun intended.",1
I bought this at my hair salon. The product is okay except for the awful odor. I couldn't wait to wash it out.,0
These were recommended the last time I got a facial (the best facial of my life actually). The idea was to cleanse the face and exfoliate before bed and let the skin repair itself overnight. My face is considerably less oily than before.,1
"Very thick, takes a long time to dry, streaks and chipped within 1 day!!
And All ingredients are not listed on the bottle.",0
The polish is okay but the brush separated from the cap the second time I opened it.  Now the black cap twists off and I have to use an instrument or pliers to remove the brush from the polish.,0
"The best. I'm picky about texturizers because I hate the scent of most of them and/or they make my fine hair just look stringy. This one checks all the boxes for me. Smells amazing, doesn't make me look greasy. One star off for being so ridiculously expensive. I use it probably 15 times and the can is empty, which is why I've only purchased twice so far.",1
"I like the OPI Crystal Nail File, because it is small for carrying in my handbag.  I like that is comes in a protective plastic tube.
This nail file is good for travel because it is on the small side but works well and I am pleased with the product.",1
Q. Is Made in China ?,0
Doesn't work with Mia 2 model,0
"I have never used the smaller version of this product so I can't compare it to that, but I do know that this product sucks.  The very next day my nails are chipped at the tips.  Big chunks of nail polish can be peeled off my nails when a corner near the base starts to come up.  Thought I was saving money by buying a bigger version - but it appears I wasted my money instead.  I do not recommend this product.",0
didn't help and made the balding even worse....,0
Great shampoo with natural ingredients,1
Not the same ingredients. Beware..,0
"I did a lot of research about hair dryers and I had found one that was cheaper but did not have all the features I wanted so I finally decided on this one. I really like how it looks. It's sleek and the purple is very pretty. I love that you can pick the speeds and the heat level on this model. I don't like to fry my hair so I always use the medium heat setting and it drys my hair in prob 5 min. It does leave my hair a little bit frizzy but not as bad and the last model I used which was a long time ago. I have been air drying my hair since I was young cause the hair dryer my mom had sucked very much it fried your hair and left it frizzy. But even though it leaves it a little frizzy it's nothing I can't get rid of with a quick run through with my straightener. I have pretty long, thick, color treated hair that usually takes a long time to dry so 5 min is awesome. It also leaves it with a nice shine. Other than the slight frizzing I love this hair dryer and would highly recommend it.",1
I don't see any great difference in my hair from using this product. The fragrance is a little overwhelming. The bottle I received had a cracked nozzle right out of the package. It still works but it keeps breaking which makes it awkward to use. I would have given it 3 stars if it weren't for the bad condition of the bottle.,0
The fragrance is intense and gave me a headache.  Yes my hair is soft but not worth the pain,0
"This item is only useful with the BioIonic flat iron and as I returned the flat iron, it was useless to me.",0
"Out of all the lipsticks, glosses, ETC Ive used in my 66 years = I LIKE THIS!!! Beautiful color that does stain the lips (not sure what reviews that say it doesn't mean???) I apply it only once across lips, becuz more makes it darker and I like it light since I have some wrinkles atop lips. Mahalo!!",1
So so holding power.,1
"Butter is my favorite polish.  It always delivers wonderful coverage, and exactly the color and finish it promises.  The matte finish is my favorite.  It makes flaws disappear and gives a more refined and tasteful look to my nails, which are stubby and untrustworthy in attractiveness.",1
Had the worst breakout of my life. I will never use this again.,0
Very few of these product work as advertised. Sorry. Life is what it is. But this helps and is as good as any other...and I've tried a lot. The BEST cosmetic is a joyous outlook and its smile!,1
not impressed with color or polish....way too expensive,0
"My husband has very sensitive skin and a very heavy beard. After trying a few other things, he has been really happy with wet shaving using a Panasonic electric razor and this shave cream in the shower with a no-fog mirror. It seems to go more quickly and gives him a smooth shave. The large bottle lasts almost 18 months which makes the price worth it.",1
Love glo products,1
Four months after purchase; it stopped working. Silk'n wouldn't support devices ordered through the seller. Would have been better off ordering it direct.,0
"I was beyond excited when I got this in the mail, since it's highly raved upon on Youtube. On the regular, I used the waterproof version of Garnier's Micellar water, and it works just fine, but as a product Junkie I'm always on the hunt for better and faster makeup removing products. With that said, I saturated a cotton round and applied onto my end-of-day waterproof mascara lashes. I held it for about a minute and to my utter shock, there was hardly any mascara transferred onto the cotton round. So I swiped some more and removed some of the mascara, but most of it was still on my lashes! Had I been using my other micellar water, I would have fully removed everything by then. For years I had my eye on this Micellar water, but it was always so expensive and when I finally found it fairly priced on Amazon, I jumped on it and purchased. If your buying this for waterproof mascara removal, keep on looking bc this does not work for that. It removed my eye shadow nicely, but so does my other half priced micellar water that I'm going to keep using instead of this.",0
Great but expensive.,1
"Perfect product for my hair.  I have a very thick head of fine hair that needs a little gentle lift to not flatten out by the end of the day.  This is one of the few products that doesn't get stiffish, doesn't weigh the hair down, and has a lovely, light scent.  It's brush-outable, and a little goes a long way.",1
"I wanted to like this product. I really did! I've heard great things about the brand and I really needed a good eye cream. Sadly, this cream made my eyes SO ITCHY! I think I may have had an allergic reaction or a bad batch because even though my eyes were soft and moisturized, they itched like crazy. Beside my weird reaction, there were a few other disappointing factors. The cream is SO THICK and it takes forever to absorb into the skin, then once it is absorbed it leaves the skin a weird texture. I still gave it 2 stars because it did help with my dark circles a little bit, and you only need a little bit at a time so even though the jar is small I imagine it would last a while. Unfortunately, not for me.",0
Runs like water lumpy and discolored it's either heavily watered down or just out right fake will be going to the salon from here on out.,0
"Couldn't wait to get this as I was a huge fan of the original. I thought that it was now just in aerosol form, which I prefer. It is a completely different formula. Smells awful, like grandma hair is all I can relate it to, no offense grandmas. The original was fresh and clean smelling. Also, it made my hair look and feel like I just sprayed it with tons of hairspray, total helmet head hair. Don't be fooled by the new packaging, it is not the same as the original. They shouldn't have messed with perfection.",0
"Love love love this topcoat but would suggest buying somewhere else. I ordered two bottles in June (always like to have an extra on hand) and when I opened the second yesterday, the bottle was broken. Because its outside of the return window, amazon will not replace it. (Please don't judge the dirty car mats - it collapsed in my hand after I opened the box and I didn't want it on my car seats!)",0
My hair is the healthiest it has been in years.  I love this product!,1
leaves my hair greasy,0
Leaves my skin very smooth and does not feel greasy.,1
"These blades don't seem to agree with my face. They may work for some people, but another brand works better for me.",0
not working,0
Very strong smell.  This was recommended by my beautician for my daughter who suffers from scalp psoriasis.  It didn't help.,0
"I have been buying this from my dermatologist for some time so when I saw this being sold on Amazo by ShopXperts for
$20 less I thought I was getting a good buy. When I received it I noticed it smelled and looked different and felt different on my skin as well. The color was off and there was no tingling when I put it on my face. I looked very closely at the container it came in and it looked the same until I looked at the bottom. The real product says Taral Plastics on the bottom and it also says 2oz 58mm. The copy from this company does not say any of this and has a funny horseshoe like thing on it. Just to be sure that it wasn't because Image Skincare changed the container they used and the formula of the cream I went to my dermatologist today and bought a new container of it. It still says Taral Plastics and 2oz 58mm and the cream is still the same as it always was. DO NOT BUY from this company. You are getting fake Junk!!! Makes me so angry that they are getting away with this!!!!!  I called Image skin care directly to see if they sell to this company and they do not! They said they don't sell to any online retailers and Shopxperts is not an authorized retailer. Learned my lesson- you get what you pay for.",0
"I have extremely sensitive skin on my face. I get burned very easily so I have to wear sunblock most days. Trying to find a sunblock that works for me has been quite the chore. Within about a minute of putting this sunblock on my face it started burning. I had to wash it off quickly and then ice my face for about an hour to get the heat to come down. Hopefully it'll be ok in a few hours. The only sunblock I have been able to use on my face so far is:

http://www.amazon.com/Vanicream-Sunscreen-Sensitive-Skin-Ounce/dp/B000V1QLEM

Unfortunately it doesn't offer much protection. I can be out in the sun maybe 20 minutes with it on before I start to burn, but it's better than nothing. Back to the drawing board :(

Update:

After a long time searching I tried Blue Lizard
http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Lizard-Australian-Sunscreen-Sensitive/dp/B000EY4YLS/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1408205687&sr=1-1

This works great for me, stops me burning and I have no adverse reactions. Hurrah!",0
"The first days I use it I actually didn't see any change, but after a few more days It started doing its work.

Depending on my time I use it one or two times per day and it's doing what it's suposed to do.",1
"Like everyone says, line thinner than wanted but can build it up.  It wasn't like the regular formula that just slides off easily in a strip in the shower.  With the original formula I don't even touch my eyes.  While showering it always slips off with no residue.  Was safe with my eyelash extensions.",1
"Giving to two stars because I think if it absorbed I would love it.

In its defense i do have oily skin (though this was suggested to me for the protection benefits). It doesn't smell bad and the texture is awesome. But my oily skin refuses to absorb it so it leaves me with a nice sheen - which by the way isn't actually super greasy which is awesome. Not the end of the world in a Boston winter BUT come summer this will have to go.

Probably great for comb/dry skin!",0
"best smelling perfume by far! Smell is so clean, no one will ever know its perfume that you are wearing!",1
"thickens, but if you want support i wouldnt get it. also tends to provide a lot of curling on a mans hair.",1
The Luna Play is a huge waste of money. It is by far the worst electric face brush I have ever gotten. First of all the battery isn't chargeable or changeable so you're at the mercy of how long it decides to last. Secondly it is so poorly designed that in order to press and hold the power button your other fingers have to be on top of the bristles- kind of defeats the purpose when you can't even get it on your face when you're trying to use it. Won't purchase again.,0
Great hand lotion.a,1
"It drys quickly, but you can use a spray bottle with water to help the NuFace glide easier. I have found that Aloe Vera gel is just as good, it doesn't dry as quickly, and is cheaper.",1
"I feel robbed, not who is to blame, but this lotion is fragrance, is pure water",0
"WARNING - THIS ITEM IS THE NEW ""SULFATE FREE"" VERSION - NOT THE ITEM PICTURED!!! Rusk has updated their formula and the new shampoo does NOT lather or clean hair like the original product did... Don't waste your time or money - you'll be VERY disappointed.",0
"Good stuff. I have coarse, but not thick, oily scalp but dry hair. I spray this in and tousle it and it gives me nice messy beachy almost-curls. Smells nice, isn't too heavy, oily or sticky.",1
"Soft, shiny pink. Def. need two or three coats. It's pretty sheer.  Was hoping it would have been more peachy in color but it's a true pale pink .",1
This Merkur razor offers an easy and close shave. The long handle offers good control and a secure grip. it comes with one sample Merkur razor blade.,1
"I love this shampoo, it give my hair incredible volume. It has a nice smell and texture as well.",1
"I too just threw away $20 and the bottle.  No place does the description say this product is for oily skin until one reads the bottle itself.  Mine is a bit dry, but now peeling after 2 uses.  Purchased thru Skincare Market.  Very disappointed and feel that poorly advertised products should be returnable.  I have always Elta products with this exception.  Just feel burned!",0
the pen tip is very hard and makes it harder to remove mistakes,0
There are many other better products at the same price point.  Very thin on lather.,0
This wipe is so soft. I was hesitant to buy it but kept seeing good reviews for it. So I decided to get it I had eyeshadow and a liquid lipstick and it took it off. I was really surprised even my husband asked if there was anything on it and I said no it's just the little towel. The packaging is really cute as well.,1
A little bit oily for me....,1
"Doesn't even break down when I try to rub it in my hands.

Just which chunks, like little chips stick to my fingers.

Worthless.

I was obviously sent an old jar that's not usable.",0
I gave the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Foaming Gel 4 stars because I have found it to be a bit drying on my dry sensitive skin.  However...that being said I use it 2x daily and have had no problems with eczema since I've been using it.  I use hydrating products after washing and always use Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Balm which is fabulous.moisturizer.,1
"Great product, great price.  I work in the prestige skincare industry and can say this is a quality product with results.",1
"High quality men's cologne and it is highly concentrated which means this bottle will easily last me two years.  Normally a Polo (green) user and very satisfied with this manly aroma. In other words,  it doesn't have any hint of a feminine fragrance.",1
Yes I love the obagi 10,1
Such a pretty color! Everyone gives me compliments when I wear it on my nails.,1
"Got it bc of the claims to make polish last longer. I just used it saturday night, it is now monday morning. I started seeing chips by the time i woke up. I literally did it around 11:00pm the night before, and woke up around 10:00am....The polish itself has a very watery consistency. In other reviews, I saw that it works best with the cnd ""sticky base coat"". I used that, which is very watery as well. I purchased that a few years back, but I heard that polish can last for many years. I used an OPI polish. The vinylux left a very nice s*** at first-comparable to gel. It's still pretty shiny-not nearly as nice as it was initially, and there are quite a few chips. I'll give it a try again...if anyone has any suggestions please let me know! Probably won't purchase again, but will def update if I get better results.",0
Did not fit my Elchim dryer??? So disappointed.,0
It came broken,0
Not the item pictured. This is actually alcohol free aftershave,0
"This has a very bizarre texture and peels off your face it you rub it once its dry. You can also feel it during the day, which I thought was not ideal.",0
Very disappointed that this flat iron did not have a way to tell the temperature or allow me to control it.  Had no idea you could buy an iron these days without either. The seller Mybeautywarehouse refused to accept the return.  This iron burnt my hair and is now useless.,0
"I bought a dollar store one and it was a lot better than Zoya
will never buy another polish that would cost me that!
Disliked it !",0
"Good for shine only. The hair gets dry, doesn't hold style. Doesn't add volume. Be aware that you cannot return.",0
Love the candle but the vendor s no good.,0
Works wonders on blonde/gray hair,1
Crappy product to stop sweat,0
After a month of using it I can see a slight difference.,1
Great but broke in 1 year,1
"helps with my itchy eczema and love the fact that its parba, perfume, and alcohol free. Yes, its hard to  dispense but I don't mind because I know the product won't be contaminated.",1
"I bought this from the kora website. I absolutely love this moisturizer (hydrating day & night cream). It really does its job and moisturizes my face! I put it on after spritzing a kora mist (usually the citrus or the rose). I usually put on the blemish gel before moisturizing if needed. It smells sooooo good and leave your face all nice and glowy, too! The only downside is that it feels like you have something..and putting this on before makeup is a huge mistake. I once put this under makeup and it didn't really let me blend too well.",1
"I got this facial lotion as a free sample and loved the light feel.  I still love the lotion, however I would never by this again.  Just as other reviews have stated, the pump does not work.  I was able to use it 2-3 times before it quit working.  Now I will have to cut it open to finish using the product.",0
Does great job on teen's acne.,1
"Great primer. Not to heavy and didn't make my skin extra shiny or oily. I would recommend it, especially if using silicon based airbrush products",1
Pretty deep green color.,1
"I have long, strait, super thick hair.  I color treat and I like to have an oil product to put in my damp hair after I wash.  This stuff smells amazing! I like the results, but I feel as if I have to use a TON to get the results I want.  Even using a lot, my hair never looks greasy to too weighted down, but I'm thinking it will get expensive to replace. I was a long time user of Moroccan Oil and I think the consitency works well with less product for my hair.",1
Product works well would buy again when finished,1
Terrible... Returning. Made my fine hair greasy and flat. Can't recommend which is unfortunate because the scent is gorgeous.,0
"I ordered it on my husband's Amazon Prime account.

This is the first sunscreen that feels like it's actually soothing my skin and not irritating it.  And I have tried everything.  Many times I've shelled out hundreds for 2 oz bottles of artisan, natural, full spectrum protection.  Everything upsets my redhead skin.  Except this.  It's a little pricey but my derm says to think of it like a prescription medication needed to stay healthy.

Update: Totally bummed.  After a couple weeks of use my skin was incredibly dry and flaky.  Can't use this product anymore.  Trying Andalou 1000 roses next... Will see....",0
great product.,1
"This stuff is highly over rated. I looked at all the reviews before I bought this and am very disappointed. This work no better than CERAVE that I can buy at Walmart cheaper. If you want to spend big bucks on a bad product, go ahead and buy this.",0
Received package today and the conditioner had leaked all over the other items and the bottle. A simple piece of tape going over the pump would have eliminated that. I'm not a very happy customer,0
Works good for thinning hair.,1
"I was hoping this mascara would curl lashes as well, but it didn't. It only lenghtens them. Aside from that, the formula is very good for natural looking lashes and it does come out with warm water. I don't like rubbing my eyes so much because they become red, that's the downside of rubbing it to come off.",0
"Vincent Longo Water Canvas Base takes the saying ""a little goes a long way"" a little too seriously. This tiny tube of foundation base is not worth $45.00, not to me anyway. Yes, it's creates a nice soft feeling on your skin but it did not help my makeup stay put or minimize pores like other, less expensive bases and primers. It actually felt like glycerin which you can pick up anywhere for a fraction of this price. I didn't notice any difference in the final look with or without it. I was very disappointed and could not imagine ever purchasing or recommending Canvas Base, not when there are plenty of products available that do the job perfectly.",0
Can't live without this.  It's the best dry shampoo on the market even on dark hair.,1
"Does Mason Pearson ever wonder what's happening to all his brushes? Is he constantly digging in the backs of his bathroom drawers and cupboards accusing his family members of losing his brushes? Do you think he knows people are selling them all here on Amazon??? If I were him and found out, I would demand some of that exorbitant $150 amount. And start locking up his brushes. Seriously!",1
"I purchased a few samples of Pureology shampoo+conditioner through the Amazon sampling program, as I was interested in trying Pureology products. I never tried this brand before and wanted to have at least a vague opinion on their products before buying the full size.

The `Smooth Perfection` shampoo and conditioner did nothing to combat the frizziess I usually get. The `Hydrate` and `Sheer Hydrate` lines did a way better job of smoothing my hair than this line. If you don't hate patchouli and bergamont (like I do), I would recommend trying those instead of the `Smooth Perfection`.
The shampoo is indeed a gentle products; but it's so gentle that, even after lathering it twice in my hair in the same wash, I didn't feel my hair quite clean after using it. Also, my hair got oily a day earlier than usual.
After rinsing, the conditioner did left my hair smooth, almost like feeling it coated in a silicone film. But the smoothness didn't lasted when the hair dried out. The hair was soft and conditioned, but definitely not smooth and frizz free.

With all the Pureology emphasis on scent and aroma-therapeutic blends, I actually think I dislike all their scents I tried. While the `Smooth Perfection` scent is definitely more toned down than the awful patchouli in the `Hydrate` line... well... it smells like laundry detergent (a violet musky laundry detergent) or fabric softener. Scent is definitely something personal, some might actually enjoy it.",0
"Product itself is great, but the spray nozzle is total garbage. Its not an even, fine mist like other sprays. Im going to try to find a new bottle to pour it into.",1
Nice feel and smell.,1
Very pleased with the prompt delivery. Very liable and durable curling iron.,1
Doesn't cover well.  I bought the Zoya red and it is fine but this color has terrible coverage.,0
HOLY MOLY the smell on these products is so strong!  You could literally smell it in his hair for days! The hold was decent and we would have really enjoyed the product had the smell not been so overwhelming.  We bought this with the Man Made Clay and it to has this super strong scent and the scent on both of these products lingers all day long!,0
"I too received this product, as an amenity from a hotel and thankfully so, as I had forgotten my lotion. I am a product snob therefore find something and stick with it however I decided to try this and loved it! I did not find it greasy in the least, as it absorbed quickly and left no residue, but did moisturize in an exceptional manner leaving behind healthy glowing skin. The scent is wonderful....very clean and light, which is exactly what I want otherwise my lotion conflicts with my perfume and you end up smelling like potpourri. I wouldn't say it was, ""prescription"" strength, nor do they, but it did work quite well on my dry skin and therefore I would deem it a wonderful body lotion with a fabulous light fragrance, which is well worth the price. When you add the great clean scent to the lovely light smooth texture of this lotion you get a very decadent experience, which oddly enough is quite relaxing....just as described!",1
Arrived timely and as described,1
Love this product.  Not tacky and holds well in humidity!  Smell is llight and fantastic.  Also I received a can damaged in shipping and you and Amazon replaced quickly.  Thank you for standing behind your products and Amazon....your promises  :),1
This made me break out. As a started to see slight results of less reddness.. Much more acne appeared and cause me to break out so bad,0
Very satisfied with the product but experienced problems with the pump. The pump is supposed to dispenses (2) equal serums. About 1/3 way through the product only one would dispense. I returned for a refund and reordered the product again.,1
Good ingredients but very drying.  Made my normally oily skin very tough even with nightly shea butter treatmemt.  Leaves a whitcast and don't know that it protected me from sun very well.  Will not buy again.,0
Nothing special and way not worth the price.,0
"I had to return it. Had a weird smell coming from it. Did try to use it a couple of times. The air flow is pretty legit, but it doesn't get as hot. I have curly, thick hair, so I need the flow but I need the heat a lot too. I've used other Babyliss hair dryers and haven't had an issue. This just wasn't for me.",0
Some may like. I don't like the smell. Can't describe it....vanilla and a headache combine.,0
"This product is crap. Not only does it tangle my hair every time I put it on high, but now I smell burning from it and the thing started clicking when I turn it on. I haven't had it for very long... only 1.5 years?! My last hair dryer lasted at least 5.  Disappointed and will not purchase again.",0
"These go on chalky, and I wouldnt describe them as moisturizing.",0
Does it said it would.,1
Love the color!,1
"Quick shipping! Thank you.
I had never smelled the perfume but bought it on the simple fact I love Oribe.  I'm so happy I did!!",1
"Nice, light moisturizer.",1
I bought my first one from a beauty salon and order my second on Amazon. When it came the bottle looked the same but it smelled different and was yellow and not clear like the previous bottle.,0
"Pros:  This is a good serum.  My face drank it right up.  I felt like it firmed and hydrated my skin.

Cons:  I had to pump the nozzle 15-20 times to get the serum to come out of the bottle.  I stopped laying it on its side hoping that would help.  Even with the bottle sitting upright, it was still tough to get the serum out.  I haven't bought it again for that reason only.",1
"I would not buy this item again because the set does not heat up hot enough even if you preheat for an hour.  Also, the clips cause dents in your hair if you are lucky enough to have them not fall out.",0
"I'VE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND LOVE IT.
IT TIGHTENS MY SKIN AND I USE IT BEFORE IMPORTANT EVENTS,
WHERE I WANT MY FACE TO LOOK ITS BEST.",1
The product says all natural but there is red 33 and blue 1. Total disappointment.,0
Don't spend the money for this you can get better quality somewhere else. I bought it and there is nothing special about this shampoo.,0
Excellent,1
It left lot of residue on top of head and hard to wash it off. I regret i didn't return quickly enough. A waste of money,0
The photos showing what the product look like are nothing like what it actually is.,0
"With middle age came terribly dry skin on my face. The worst of it? Endless little flakes around my forehead and cheeks which did not respond to any manner of moisturizer that I tried. Not even olive oil, avocado oil, etc. helped. Natural products, anti-ageing products, dermatologist reco'd products, gentle exfoliation -- I racked up quite a supply of products and expenses, but nothing made a difference. Short of using cortisone cream daily (a bad idea since it will thin the skin), I had no remedy. Somehow I had passed by the miracle of shea butter -- maybe because it's usually in products with ingredients I wouldn't put on my face? But after trying PUR mineral makeup, loving it and discovering that it was loaded with shea butter, I searched for a face cream with shea butter and the ""cleanest"" ingredient list I could locate. I found this L'Occitane product and couldn't be happier. My flaking has cleared up 99% and my skin feels as smooth as it looks. This is a rich, luscious cream. Love it! It inspired me to use shea butter body lotion as well, which I also highly recommend to those with dry, sensitive skin.
10/2012 update: Sadly, the formulation that I rave about here is no longer made. L'Occitane has replaced it with a reformulated version which I have yet to try. Seems the reviews of the reform'd version by longtime users are less than glowing; I'm hoping for the best!",1
"Have used this product for many years and was pleased to find it at Amazon.
 Love the aroma, the foaming bubbles  and the feel after  a warm bath.
It is a bit pricey but I am allergic to many cosmetics and I find that Perlier products are good for my skin.
This latter  is an important reason for using this product.  I look forward to future sales!!!!!!",1
"This does not have the, ""I want to eat it"", smell. As far as how it works, it is a basic, nothing special, not worth $5 shampoo. IF it was a basic shampoo that left my hair smelling like, ""I want to eat it"", then it would be worth $5.",0
My husband uses this product and it and likes it. Doesn't smell awful like so many after shaves do.,1
"Bright, bright purple with blue psychodelic tones. Not subtle at all.",0
Save your money.,0
"I just finished my first bottle, what can I say other than I LOVE IT.  My skin looks great.  I have tried many products over the years and this is the best yet.  Everyone tells me how great I look.  This is one beauty product I will never be without!",1
"I used to LOVE this product. Used it for nearly 8 years. But when they made the switch to 4oz packages for the same price as the 6.8 oz. I had to make the switch to a new product line, La-Roche Posay. I am disappointed in in Pevonia for the price hike, it was a bit to drastic.",0
Great turn around time,1
The things I learned about using this make up is you need to move quickly and a little product goes a very long way. I found it to be very heavy/full coverage and unfortunately can look caked on if not applied correctly. With all of that said the coverage wasn't as long lasting when I did apply it to look natural. So I have given up on my still very full bottle of product and moved on to something new.,0
"After reading the reviews  I decided to go with the Babyliss PRO.  What I immediately found was that it is quite heavy and because the handle is thick, it's hard to grip it.  I have short hair which is easy to dry so it gets the job done. As I was drying my hair I was thinking that if I had long hair, which took longer to dry, I would need to take a break to give my arm a rest.  If you have long hair or need to spend time drying your hair there are better choices.",0
"This review is for the Ayurveda variety.

I personally quite like the scent of the Ayurveda scrub as it does have a calming effect with me, and it seems to work well as a scrub.  I do need to dip into the jar to get salt about four or five times to cover my body, but that seems reasonable to me.

It would be nice if the salt stayed together a bit better as I was transferring it from the jar to my skin.  The salt doesn't really stick together that well, so it wants to fall off of my fingers.

Related to that - I took a star away because I also ordered a smaller jar of this same scrub, and the two jars have different consistencies.  This larger jar has more liquid in it (the oil mentioned in the description, I presume), whereas the smaller jar is more dry and seems more like compacted salt.  I only have the two jars to go by, so I'm not sure if other jars differ as much, too.  The salt in this one stays together better because there's more oil to bind it, but the grains are still kind of loosely held together.

It works really well to make my skin feel better, and the scent is soothing to me.  I ultimately really like the end effect, but I would like the scrub to be more consistent from jar to jar, as well as be easier to apply.",1
"I've used this shampoo and conditioner for almost 10 years and swore by it.  I recently ran low and reordered.  In using the new batch today for the first time, I was shocked.  It immediately felt like I was washing my hair in laundry detergent.  It was harsh, and produced so many suds that I thought I'd never get it rinsed out completely.  Even with conditioning twice, my hair still felt horrible, was more tangled than usual, and seemed to break more easily.  I've had no changes in my hair for months, no color, never permed so I'm sure this change is due to the new batch of L'Occitane.  Now I'm on the hunt for a good oil- based, non- abrasive, repairing shampoo.  Anyone got any good suggestions?",0
great color and in certain light looks black,1
I love how creamy it is.  It makes my skin so soft!,1
"Exceptional cream for hands that work hard in gardens or anywhere else! Pretty steep. With they offered occasional specials on just this hand cream. Would use it for certain as I used that very quickly. Excellent product but overpriced, I feel,",1
This is not the color I received - after researching the name was right but the picture was wrong - I wanted the color in the picture...,0
Recent purchase so far so good.  Love that it has a little tint to it helps to smooth skin tone.  Seems to work well on very sunny days and protects my very sun sensitive skin.,1
"This product is incredible and really does work - applying now for 30 days and very noteable results, well done!",1
"As a polish addict, I love zoya. And THIS is my favorite color- it is like a mix of coral and rose with some low grade shimmer, MY favorite color.",1
Completely fake!! I've used a department store bought version of this and the one I received from this seller smelled nothing like it and the scent didn't even last for more than an hour. Axe body spray lasted longer. Saw all these good reviews and I was fooled!!,0
"Gives my skin a nice, natural, look with a dewy glow.  I especially like it at the beach!",1
"Too tiny for the price! Good product though, use it for my hair.",0
"Arrived intact, I haven't used them yet so I'm unable to give a fair review",1
Doesn't slim anything.,0
"Works great, but the handle is a little long.",1
"Doesnt get very hot, even when its turned all the way up I still have to hold it on my hair for what seems like forever",0
I bought this for my boyfriend who doesn't particularly like cologne.  he LOVES this and wears it every day.  I highly recommend it!,1
"Definitely not doing the job i expected, I've tried it on wet hair, dry air and still don't see the job. ESPECIALLY if you have extensions, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. I like kenra brand leave in conditioner MUCH better.",0
Sorry to report bliss did not give me a golden tan ... You have to spray over at least 2-3times,0
Not convinced it is real or maybe old.,0
It doesn't do anything,0
Perfect safety razor.  Feels great in my hand and easy to adjust and replace blades.  Will never go back to the commercial disposable razors again.,1
Horrible. Doesnt do much for hair and has a bad odor to it.,0
"I was so looking forward to finding a hair dryer that could cut down my drying time, but alas, this was not it. I have very fine, soft hair, that holds a lot of water, and I have a lot of it. This blow dryer does have serious power, but all it did for me was spin my hair into knots in mere seconds! I move my dryers around a lot to avoid concentrating heat in any one spot, and like to blow dry upside down for added volume... combine that with the velocity of this dryer and you get an utter rat's nest. Ugh. I had to stop about three times in one drying session to slowly chip away at the knots, trying to avoid breaking off my hair, but some tangles were so bad that I couldn't avoid snapping off previously healthy strands. Any time I might have saved in drying I made up for (and then some) in combing out massive tangles, and damaging my hair.

Funny enough, I had ordered this shortly before having my hair cut/colored, and my stylist used this same hair dryer. My hair was a tangled mess for her, too, and although I'm accustomed to tangles with fine hair, it was pretty rough, and I remember wondering what could have been the difference. The next day I opened the box and used the dryer I'd bought for myself, and I had the same issues. I tried being even more cautious, drying it carefully in one direction, upright, with a paddle brush... until I realized it was barely helping, and remembered that I splurged on this product to make my morning routine easier, not more tedious. Wamp wamp.

I whipped out my much-less expensive Conair dryer to test the difference, and sure enough, next to no tangles. Lesson learned - more money doesn't necessarily mean a better product!",0
Loved the price ..,1
The product seems sketchy.. tried it with no results for more than a week.,0
"We've only had this hair dryer for a month or so, but so far it has been exactly what we expected it to be.  It's light and drys quickly on the low setting.",1
"I was so excited to finally commit to buying this product, I couldn't wait to try it out.
However when I did, it went on quite heavy and and did not have a light feeling at all, like other BB Creams I've tried.
Also it looked very caked on and pale on my skin. I even went on the Jane Iredale website and had my skin matched to the BB 5 before I bought it. It is way lighter in color tone than it suggests, beware. I'm not particularly tanned, I am Irish!!
An expensive mistake!",0
"This product really does give fine, thin hair volume. I ordered it because i tried L'Anza Healing Trauma Care first (purchased it from my salon) and it was great. So then I tried the Color Care shampoo and conditioner. It really did keep the color in my hair longer. So, then I looked at this product. I told my hairdresser about these products--he switched to L'Anza hair dye. I wonder if they have L'Anza perms? My fine hair doesn't take to perms an coloring well--that's why I needed the original color care healing trauma treatment. I'm really impressed with this brand.",1
"I love this hairspray, it holds well and smells great, however, I have had three cans of this hairspray in which the sprayer has gotten clogged or the can has stopped spraying and I can not get it to work. It is so disappointing!  The last can I purchased from Amazon and there is more than half the can of hairspray left, this is not an Amazon problem, this is a defective design with the spray nozzle. I just don't think I am going to buy this hairspray anymore.  I even contacted the manufacturer about this problem and have not received a response from them.",0
It made my hair fall out,0
"While the consistency is nice, be aware that this is not at all the color in the picture. It is best described as a bright coral. Wish makeup companies would try a bit harder when depicting their products. After all, the actual, exact color is the most important thing.",0
It is a knock off. It isn't the true burberry. It does smell pretty good. But still displeased that I spent the price i did on it. And it not being the true product.,0
I like this a lot will probably buy it again,1
Wife loves it,1
Fast dry. Leaves hair shiny.,1
"Wonderful light texture when applying.  My skin, and I'm 68, feels like a newborn baby's.  I would like to order a truckload!",1
This new leave-in formula  is terrible!!  I used the OLD formula for 12 years and it was the BEST product for curly hair.  The NEW formula leaves my hair dry and frizzy :(  I've tried contacting L'Anza to find out what's going on and they never reply.  They've lost a ton of customers as a result... the search for a new product continues (sigh).,0
My favorite eyelash curler! I can get close to my eyelash base and they don't pinch!,1
Doesn't leave a smooth finish. There are better products out there,0
Don't like the scent - wouldn't buy it again!,0
"I love the smell of Oribe hair products and was expecting a similar scent in the fragrance. This fragrance smells NOTHING like the hair products and I was extremely disappointed. It smells very strong, almost unisex (and not a good unisex smell either). I would not recommend this product!",0
I tried this product at a hotel I stayed at last month and I had to have it. Most products I've tried leave my skin feeling dry and tight.,1
"Be warned, my protool worked wonderfully for the first 6-7 months I had it. Then one day while I was using it, I heard a loud pop sound and it shut off. Now it won't turn back on. Because it is passed the return period there is nothing I can do.

I contacted Paul Mitchell but because it wasn't purchased from a licensed salon, they cannot help me either.

I would advise purchasing from a licensed salon, you may have to pay more up front but will be able to receive help should any problems arise with your protool.",0
I was not pleased with Dermablend loose powder. It is lacked for light and fair complexion but the color is to dark for my light complexion. Also I find it does not cover as stated yet it is more expensive than most loose powders.,0
Love this product!,1
The quick fix concealer is in a lipstick type twist applicator.  Each time I have used it is smashes down and doesn't go on smoothly.  It takes a lot of work to blend it in.  I think the product is too thick to go on small areas of the face.,0
It did not help at all waste of money,0
"I love using my brush because of this product. The orangey scent makes the room smell wonderful, and it really cleans my brush.",1
This was for a gift.,1
"Great product that took a little getting used to for me. The first time I used it, I worked it through my wet hair and dried it... my hair looked dirty and oily when I finished. I was using it the way I used mousse, though, including hitting the roots. That was the mistake. The next time, I used it more as a finishing cream on dry hair, focusing mostly on the ends and staying far away from the roots. I couldn't believe how well this defined my curls and eliminated frizz, even on a rainy day when my hair would normally frizz up badly.",1
Provides maximum coverage without feeling too heavy. I used my sister's and loved it so much I ordered my own!,1
perfect to order,1
does exactly what its meant for - a must for using NuFace,1
Disappointed there wasn't any bronzing,0
"It's gentle and my face feels smooth after using it. I don't notice miracle blemish clearing like some others mentioned, but I still like it. Also- I was deterred by the name of this at first; ""peel"" to me sounds scary and harsh. It's not a peel AT ALL. It's an apple juice-colored gel that you smooth onto clean skin and rinse off. No peeling.",1
Great price for this oil. I first tried this in a spa and it is the best oil for massage.,1
"The handle took some getting used too, but once I got the hang of it - I found it to be easier to use actually. Gets VERY hot, but I don't hear my hair cracking like it's about to set on fire. Love this curling iron!!",1
Works well,1
Was so disappointed that this product just quit working after two years. When you pay this much you expect it to work longer. First the digital display stopped and then no more heat. That said when it worked it was great on my fine hair.,0
"I love this shampoo, I only gave it a 4 stars because in shipment it may have froze a little and some leaked out.. not a problem and doesn't take away from the quality of the product.",1
Clogs up my razor. I literally have to use my power water floss machine to blast my razor clean... it clogs up after just one or two strokes and regular sink water doesn't have enough pressure to even clean it. It turns shaving my face into a 20 min project.,0
"I tried this to use a healthier sunscreen choice this year, but after a weekend at the pool and lake they are totally sunburned. I apply before we got into the sun and religiously re-apply throughout the day. This is not worth the money,",0
"Love this, not greasy and still holds but soft. Cant find a similar (cheaper) formula.",1
"The best thing about this product is its light, barely there scent. Too many hair products have a heavy, overwhelming odor which can clash with a fragrance you are wearing or just give you a headache. This pomade is a medium weight, holds hair without weighing it down too much and is easily reactivated with a little water. I use a little water when I apply it initially so that I get good coverage without too much product. I wish that the product was free of parabens but at least the pomade is mostly on the hair and not on the skin.",1
Too small,0
Boooooo parabens.  I thought this line was paragon free.  I was wrong.  It also dries out my lips!  What the heck?  Once it wears off your lips are dryer than when you first applied.  Tastes gross too.  Doesn't even smell good.,0
"Works better than expected, I'm impressed. Love it!",1
It is a good straightener but there are better straightener.,1
"Nice in that it is very quiet and doesn't burn my hair.  However, I've had two in the past 3 years and they both did the same thing - stopped blowing hot air.  I will never waste this much money again on a dryer.",0
"To be sure this ain't ""better than Botox"". But
Nightly use has resulted in smooth, well moisturized, glowing skin.",1
"It's a different substance than what I get from my hairdresser. It's hard and sticky, not soft and waxy.",0
"Only the actual bottle is CHI Silk Infusion. I do not know what's inside, but do know that is not what's inside. I recieved CHI Silk Infusion bottle with a clear oil inside; however, the product bought from the salon is yellowish in color and has a distinct scent, which this does not. It was a waste of money.",0
"This contains a silky blend of antioxidants, plant oils, etc., and does repair sun damage and minor discolorations, albeit slowly, perhaps due to the lower concentration of niacinamide.  As someone who spent most of her life in the tropics, and in the early years basking in the sun drenched in only baby oil, I now have the sun spots to prove it. (Thanks to genetics not the wrinkled skin, but I digress.  The sun spots on my hands, arms and chest have gone from a medium cocoa to light caramel and with prolonged use of this product at night, along with sunscreen during the day, I anticipate continued results.

One additional note, I'm a big fan of Nia24 Skin Strengthening Complex and since this cream delivers niacinamide, yet in a larger package (almost 3x the size) and at a lower price, I thought I'd try this for my face.  Since this only contains half of the concentration and the ingredients are slightly different, it doesn't deliver the same results as the complex and also caused minor break outs.  Use this cream for its intended purpose and spring for the complex for your face.",1
I'm a huge Essie fan and loved this color in the salon. Bought on Amazon and it was goopy and not the quality I've learned to expect. Something was off.,0
Too small and did not heat up enough for my thick course hair.,0
"This product is amazing.  I have curly hair and have worn it in it's natural state for years.  But, in the winter my hair gets flat from being under a hat all the time so I try to straighten it after my shower.  In the past I could never get it straight or if I did it was limp from using the wrong products.  I tried LOTS of products.  Then I moved to a new town and found a new hairdresser.  She used just this on my hair and blew it dry using only her fingers because that's how I told her I dry my hair.  It came out perfectly smooth and frizz free.  Hopeful, but doubtful, I went home and repeated what she did and it worked!  No kidding.  I just spray this lightly on my hair (don't use too much), comb it through to distribute it evenly, then blow it dry.  That's it!  Perfectly straight, smooth, shiny hair that's not greasy at all!  I'll use this product all the time now.",1
Very disappointed!,0
Great,1
"I had an extreme allergy attacked of itching head and skin after shower.  If you have a lot of allergies I can not recommend this product.  Also, very spendy.",0
Didn't like this product at all. There are much better ones out there. It feels oily and doesn't absorb well.,0
"This is for acne prone or combination skin. It is not very mosturizing, and is more for oily skin. Very good active ingredients. The cream version is better for  dry combination skin.  I've used this line for 8 years or more. Very good line.",1
I got it a few days late so I wasn't very happy with that but I really like the product! I have a SUPER curly hair and this iron just work perfectly! My hair can last a few days looking fabulous!!!!,1
"I LOVE this stuff. I read other reviews complaining about the smell. The smell is strong but I love it. It makes my hair feels so good. I was struggling with scalp issues since I have been working out daily. My scalp was irritated and when I used the product, I saw an immediate result. I am AA with thick hair and I love it. I use the elixer on my scalp and Huie on my hair for a great combination. My hair is soft and bouncy. expensive but It worked wonders!",1
"I hate to say it but I'm unimpressed with these pallets, the colors are pretty but the shadows aren't soft or very well pigmented. They do have good staying power once built up, but meh. For the person questioning if theirs is fake - that's the one I have. The picture looks legit (without me going to look at mine), it's just a disappointment unfortunately. For the record I bought mine in a department store. But the quality isn't there. Try Lorac or Urban Decay instead!",0
"I bought this product because I was a previous smoker and am also 61 years old. I take good care of my teeth but just needed some help with the yellowing/aging of them. I have veneers, caps and my own teeth. No dentures or prosthesis. Wow! Was I surprised. After 1 week what a noticable difference. After 3 weeks, I have people ask me if I had my teeth professionally bleached, that they look great. I am very pleased with the look I have with them. I will definitely keep using it and recommend it to others. The taste is great. No grittiness, no after taste.",1
"I have super fine hair, this actually holds a curl. Love it!",1
"I was pretty much satisfied with my previous orders, but this time it seems like not original Paul Mitchell. The bottle is full of water, too liquid and it is not like my previous orders. More over it is not working on the Dry scalp like previous Paul Mitchell.",0
"The color was not the same as appeared online.  When I tried to remove it, the polish had stained my skin and nails.  It was very difficult to get the color off!!!!  I will not buy again.",0
"I really liked this when I first bought it as it was very easy to apply, but there are three huge problems with it:
1. It doesn't really stay on all day on your bottom lid (maybe 15 minutes). You can get several hours out of the top liner
2. It is irritating to the eye lid.
3. Most importantly it CANNOT be sharpened. I have tried three different eye pencil sharpeners and it won't work with any of these.
Since it cannot be sharpened it is basically worthless after the first week.",0
"Only used product for a couple of weeks. Seemed ok. Went to charge it and realized that I had thrown away the charger. My mistake.

Went to company and tried to buy a replacement charger. Clarisonic said they didn't have any. They said they had no idea when they would get any because they had not anticipated the need.

My mistake started the problem. But because of that and their poor planning I have a $190 paperweight. Also, submitted a review like this to Clarisonic but they rejected it.",0
"Overall I find this body wash to be about what I expected. It's a satisfying treat but nothing to make it a new absolute favorite. The wash itself is fine; it lathers and cleans like any wash I'm used to. The scent (grapefruit variety) is nice: gender-neutral, not too fruity or sweet, and more complex than what you'd usually pick up at the drugstore. It's not a particular favorite, but should have broad appeal. I really don't notice it once I'm out of the shower, though.

The bottle is attractive, and gives the impression of something you'd find in a nice hotel. The pump isn't especially convenient, though. I need about five pumps to produce enough lather for a whole wash; each pump is small so I don't feel it's a large amount, just an inconvenient process. You'll also be bent over if you don't have a shower ledge at a comfortable height. It needs to be resting on something since you'll need one hand to hold a sponge and another to work the pump top. All that to say, the packaging seems luxe, but I don't actually like it better than an average squeeze bottle.

This might be a good choice if you want something that looks extra fancy, or happen to know you LOVE one of the scents. Otherwise, it's nice but not remarkable.",1
Very nice .. leaves face  clear and smooth,1
"After 18 months of low to medium usage (8-10 times a month), this dryer has died. The motor would make a loud noise as if all the coils are coming out and the dryer is totally unusable. I would never recommend a hot tools product to anyone. To make things worse, I bought this for about $60 in July 2014 and it is currently going for about $31. Thats like adding more salt to my wounds.",0
My husband told me it looked as if if was meant for kids lol. I agreed It did have a little to many sparkles for an adult. It may look better with acrylic applied to the nail as the others colors do. A little disappointed....,0
"This item was recommended from my hair stylist because my fine, but long and high density hair was starting to get dried out from gentle highlighting a couple times a year.  I had never experienced a lot of split ends in my past when I didn't highlight, in-fact, my hair was always long and soft and perfectly wavy and healthy.  I started doing very gentle highlighting (hair painted on with different colors of blonde) on my light brown hair and it look amazing!  After about a year of coloring...(ie every 4 months the highlights were touched up and a haircut) this small amount of coloring and the onset of winter left my hair breaking and lots of knotted ends. It had only been 3 weeks since my last haircut/haircolor. The only heat treatment I ever used was gentle drying on my bangs to blow them out, but it didn't take much to damage my hair.  I tried a wash-in keratin treatment (Aphogee), I tried deep conditioning treatments (one was Aussie...but I tried many others).  None smoothed out my hair more than a day or so...and the dried ends just returned.  I then did a glaze treamtent (Sebastian cellophane Clear), which smoothed things out and helped seal the cuticle for the time being.  The next week, however, I got flustered with the damage.....and my wedding is later this year...so the damage really scared me.  I binged on a couple seasons of a Netflix show and I cut off just the tips of a lot of my ends myself (which is usually ok), however, I did it so much until my layers were gone...so I messaged my stylist...apologized for being crazy and taking shears to my head, and he fit me in to fix the damage. We wanted to keep the length to prepare for my wedding, so again, he just trimmed the ends up, however the hair itself was still dry. He recommended the Oribe Hair Masque for me to use once a week, and said if it wasn't a strong enough conditioner for my hair the company would buy back the remainder of the container from him and I could exchange for a stronger conditioner.  I used this one time and my hair was beautiful. I washed with clarifying shampoo (Kendra) and then my coloring shampoo (redken) and then towel dried,applied the masque for 5 minutes, and washed out.  I applied just a small amount of head after washing out just to seal in any remaining conditioner...it has been 4 days and my hair is still amazing.  Awesome product.  I recommend for those who have mild heat and/or color damage to use once a week,",1
"I ordered this product to cover a tattoo on my wrist (it is pretty small, but black). You have to be very patient with tattoo cover ups, I learned, and I spent quite a bit of time applying it (I watched some instructional videos online). And it worked! I had an invisible tattoo.

The downside? It rubs off on EVERYTHING. If using, be careful to only wear light colors, and try to avoid any rubbing whatsoever. I used a setter and everything.... but still, it would rub off on making contact with any surface.

I think, for convenience sake, in the future I will just wear a large bracelet or watch. But the products works! If I had a tattoo on my shoulder or in an area that has less rubbing, then I would use it again in a heartbeat.",1
"The product I received was old and clumpy, I have used this brand for a while but always bought it at a retail store and never had it clump up like this one.",0
"I applied this product, i followed the instructions. It says after 3 hours that will be the maximum amount of color and then if you want to be darker to reapply. SO, i put more on after 3 hours, and again after 3 more hours and still just BARELY had much color at all. My natural skin color is light to fair skin. I was really disappointed getting hardly any color after using it all over 3 times in a roll and even worse that that it made my SO DRY!!! i mean VERY dry!!!  on top of that you can't RETURN it. $40 was just a waste!",0
Doesn't foam enough,1
"I usually LOVE this perfume, but very disappointed with the bottle I have received. I don't know the reason but the smell is very light, it smells slightly of alcohol and doesn't last 5 minutes. Nobody can smell it on me, so what's the point?!. The one I had before was prefect  and could smell it on me for ages but I don't know what is wrong with this one?? Maybe an old bottle or not the original?? It really bother me and will probably won't order it from Amazon again.",0
"I'm as lazy as lazy comes when it comes to my hair styling, but I really like this brush tool.  Now obviously it is not perfect and I have not gotten salon-quality results with it.  However, for pretty much just combing my hair and flipping it a few times, I've gotten a good enough hair style to wear out as a ""styled"" look.  You can look at all the other more detailed reviews from the ladies who are really good at hair presentation, but my review is written more for the others out there who cringe at having to spend so much time and effort (read: multiple product applications and use of multiple tools? Oh, heck no.) on their hair--this product is reasonably good and gives you a decent look pretty quickly with minimal effort. Minimal effort! That's the only way to go for me!",1
I use to love their products until they changed and started causing sores and hair loss.,0
"I was not familiar with this fragrance or company before using this.  I do use a spa lotion as my usual fragrance.  So I am familiar with using this type of cosmetic.

This bottle is a little smaller than my usual one and cost just a little less. It is not as nice, not as expensive looking.  My usual bottle is glass with a pump, but this one is plastic and the lotion squeezes out from the top.

This lotion slightly thinner than my usual one, but not much.  This kind of lotion is not meant as a body lotion for dry and irritated skin.  It is a lotion that moisturizes your skin slightly and releases the fragrance all day long.  It is meant more for the fragrance than the lotion.  This works as it should.

When I first used it I was not sure that I would like the scent, but the more I have used it I began to like it.  It is a clean scent, not too flowery, but a slight citrus spicy smell. It is not at all what I normally wear.  It reminds me of a 70s kind of fragrance.  Something I haven't worn in a while.

When it is compared to my normal body lotion it seems to be a nice value with a nice smell.",1
I like the smell of this stuff and it seems to keep my skin from drying out. It isn't too expensive when you look at some of the other premium body washes. A little goes a long way too. I will try this brand again and they have a few other scents as well,1
smells good but really haven't used it like I want to,0
I am satisfied with this product. It blends into my skin smoothly.,0
I lost my money ...,0
"Got tons of compliments on this polish.  I wear it on my toes and the 2 coats that I used has held up for 2 weeks beautifully.  I also paired with Butter base coat and top coat.  I've had multiple people comment that they think the color should be called, robin's egg blue:)",1
This pencil is a waste of money.  I bought it to use specifically on the waterline.  It barely applies very lightly and certainly doesn't stay on.  Very disappointing.  Don't waste your hard earned bucks.,0
"Crepe Erase actually seems to be highly effective. Initially the cream seems very thick, dense and greasy (my first thought was comparing it to Crisco), but it absorbs easily when applied to dry skin and surprisingly doesn't leave it feeling oily and weighed-down. It has a very light scent that's I would describe as lightly floral with herbaceous hints that's rather pleasant (pleasant enough that I've sniffed my better half after she's applied it to her arms, legs and feet). My wife has been using it for at least 10 days now, and it's made a noticeable difference in the areas of her skin that tend to be the most dry, particularly her arms, ankles and tops of her hands and feet.

This is an expensive cream, and honestly, whether it's worth it to you or not is going to depend on how well it works for you and your skin type. For my wife, who has considerable problems with dry skin, it's been effective when a lot of other products haven't been. This isn't going to be in the budget for a lot of working households out there, but I kind of wish that it was, because I can see it working and can tell she likes the effect that it's having. It does look like a little goes a long way, and this 10 ounce size looks like it might last her well over a month, but there's no denying that this is an expensive product, but I also can't deny that it works well.",1
Everything was fine,1
"First I'd like to start out with the arrival expectation, and the actual delivery of Anthony Logistics Body Cleansing Gel.

The item was shipped as a Prime item, but took a full week to arrive.
Item ordered: 02/21/2014
Item Arrival: 03/01/2014

This alone reduces the higher rating, for failure to deliver as expected. Especially when I pay for premium service as a Prime Member.

Onto the product...
I've used this product before from a sample received at a (local at the time) Sephora beauty store.

The item that arrived from amazon, smelled like I remember. Eccentric, and citrusy. I compare it close to the smell of ""I love Juicy Shampoo"" by Lush.

When applying, the fragrance of the product seemed to change, and didn't come out smelling the way that I remember. I'm not sure if it's an old mix, but the product just seems stale, as if the plastic residual settled into the formula.

All in all, I've not been satisfied with this purchase, but have been satisfied with this product in the past.

Since this review is to reflect the current shipment, and seller I wouldn't recommend buying from here, but maybe visiting a store where you're sure you're getting a fresh batch.

Thanks,

Bucky Wilson

"I recently got a sample size of this as a gift and I loved it so much I had to buy more! A little bit goes a long way and the color match, which is often the trickiest thing for me, is spot on. I have pale, but now quite fair, combination skin and a lot of redness. It covers any blemishes I might have and leaves my dry patches moisturized. I can't recommend this product enough",1
"This fit my 3900 elchim  dryer without a glitch. I don't know what others mean it didn't fit, this fit like a glove. My new curly hair loves it:)",1
I like it!,1
I glad I found this product.  It works so well hiding my bald spots.  I love it.  The only thing is that if I forgot and touch my scalp the fibers would get my nails all black.,1
"Have not used it yet, but  I know I am going to love it",1
U have thick curly hair and get ingrowns. This stuff has helped a ton,1
"Ordered this product as a gift, Amazon through all 4 tubes in a box with a very heavy item and no protection, all tubes were out of their boxes when received and the boxes damaged.",0
"the smell alone is so bad, I threw the bottle away",0
I always like Crabtree and Evelyn products.  I especially like the jojoba oil body lotion since it has such a great scent to it.,1
Love Zoya Polish!  I use the base and top coat along with 2 coats of polish. I can usually go 2 weeks without a chip.  And it is easy to remove the polish.  Also knowing it is 5 Free brings peace  of mind!,1
I only need the one item which can not be bought by it's self anymore. It only comes in a kit. So this was just what I needed. Good service as always.,1
Mario Badescu drying lotion works wonders! I have random break outs and this helps so much! The product does not always get rid of a break out but it helps maintain the size and redness. This is my second time ordering this product! MUST BUY!,1
Doesn`t curl my hair at all. I don`t understand all the hype. I mean it literally doesn`t curl any of my hair even though my hair is easy to curl. I bought Conair at the pharmacy and received multiple compliments online and in person about my hair and my curls.,0
I love their products I love perfumes and been collecting them for yrs but this brand def has a je ne sais pas quoi that will stand up to any challenge. If I could I would own their whole collections,1
I don't think this is the original perfume. It doesn't smell as the same and i received it unsealed.. Very disappointing..,0
"I like it, but I'm not very good at using it often enough to see a difference on me.  I like the moisturizing benefits and the natural aspect of it though.",1
Love this product! I have very fine wavy/semi curly hair and this gives it a nice boost. It's a dry feeling boost but thats what I need otherwise my hair is flat. It perks up my curls and adds definition.,1
"It truly does have a matte finish with no scent.  You can buy cheaper in stores, but won't find a product like this.  I work in the field, and don't want my patients to see or smell sunscreen.  I'm very happy with its performance.",1
"Didn't realise this was the XL version, even though it says so in the description but I am so happy that it is because my hair is super long and really thick so this one is perfect, i've had perfect curls/waves that last ages since using this. highly recommend.",1
"I love this serum and I already use a number of excellent serums.  The serum is thicker than most, which allows the ginseng, ceramides and ginkgo  to penetrate.  On hot nights I even use it by itself as a moisturizer.  My only problem is with the artificial color.  I was hoping the color was from chamazuline from chamomile. but alas it is artificial ,CI 42090 (Blue 1)...

The ingredients are Aqua (Water,Eau),Glycerin,Propylene Glycol,Dimethicone,Carbomer,Gingko Biloba Leaf Extract,Panax Ginseng Root Extract,Triethanolamine,Dimethiconol,Caprylyl Glycol,Cyclopentasiloxane,Ethylhexyl Cocate,Hexylene Glycol,Sodium Chloride,Phenyl Trimethicone,Glycolipids, Lecithin,Phenoxyethanol,CI 42090 (Blue 1),CI 19140 (Yellow 5).

This means that it might be inappropriate for women with sensitive skin.  I already see ingredients that my daughter in law must avoid. The gel is basically all artificial- when aloe or seaweed extracts could have done the job. I probably should knock it down a star but it works for me. I have no problem with the fragrance- it is pleasant and unobtrusive.",1
It must be a knock off.  It didn't smell the same as what I had from Sephora and it didn't last long at all.  I was very disappointed.  I would not buy it again. :(,0
"The only reason it did not get 5 stars is because my experience with other soaps is limited and Im sure there is better stuff out there. This soap smells pretty good, kind of like roses or flowers. It does not leave a lingering scent so it won't clash or compete with any aftershave scent. It seems to leave my skin feeling nice and cool. I do have very sensitive skin, and compared to the Col. Conk soaps Ive been using, I can tell a marginal difference in its effects on my skin.

All in all, after I try out a few more different soaps, I will probably buy this one again.",1
I love this and use it almost everyday! You can be  subtle or vibrant.,1
These polishes are expensive and too thin for the color to pop. I bought several because the colors are so beautiful but have returned to old faithful OPI.,0
Good product but not worth an 18$ price increase! There are some better options out there...Peter Thomas Roth...Obagi...keep looking...it is a heavier moisturizer...,0
I used to love their shampoo but the new stuff is awful. Makes my scalp itch and leaves my hair lank.  I have dry hair and it does nothing for it.,0
"This is the only product that actually works, look no further!",1
"I like the color. But there were two color shades under the ""Sailor"" color. I was hoping it was going to be more of a royal blue and instead I got a washed blue. It's still a pretty color, but not what I was expecting.",1
Flakes and smudges and does not clean off easily - I bought this with the Blinc Mascara Amplified Black and I won't buy either again.  I would rather buy the L'oreal tube mascara that is less than half the price as it does not flake or smudge and washes off easily and seems to make my lashes longer.,0
"I have extremely dry hands that become chapped easily.  This lotion is the most effective I have found.  It smells wonderful, and leaves my hands soft.",1
Love this product! I put it on in the morning if know I am not going to put on a full face of make up and it keeps me from looking like the walking dead!,1
nice washing gel....only complaint is that it is difficult to extract from the container.  Price was very good from this retailer,1
Works like a charm.,1
"I received the open box mini 2 facial cleansing brush, the brush already outside the original box.",0
Awesome,1
"*UPDATE* the last bottle I purchased through Amazon was not like the previous one I loved so much. The lotion came out a greenish color and had an odd scent. After application it did not appear as dark as the previous lotion I bought either. I suspect they sold an old bottle.

Loved the color, ease of application and lack of smell. You have to use it up fairly quickly though because it's shelf life isn't too long and begins to turn.",0
I bought it as a gift for one if my coworkers n she loves the curls that it gives to here clients.,1
"Stinks to high heaven.  It needs that Scent Secure.  The sparkles are a nice touch.  It does tan you, but you had better put it on perfectly because it streaks like crazy!  I like the old Xen-Tan Dark.  Easy to apply, a little more forgiving in the streaking department, and it didn't stink.",0
This dryer does not get very hot and is not worth $200.00. I will be returning this item.,0
"I used low heat and the low setting, but it still broke. Not worth it. :(",0
"I have been using Intellishade as my foundation for about 5-6 years. I used to work in a dermatologist office so I would buy it there with a discount. Since leaving that job, I have purchased the product from Amazon. It has always been great and I have never smelled a rat until this last purchase. I immediately felt like the tube and the cap didn't look quite right. Then the product doesn't come out well, the hole is too small. Finally, I noticed the writing on the tube is pretty off center. I admit I cannot tell a huge difference with the product itself but the texture seems a little off. It is not so bad that I won't use it but I really wonder on this one. Revision's site is very clear that they do not authorize products sold on Amazon. I'm gonna have to fork up the money at the seem office next time.",0
Did not notice any difference over lower priced alternatives.,0
The oil was too thick...it did not work well for my hair.,0
wonderful,1
"Lovely texture and quality, good deal. I keep a jar in both bathrooms to use every day.",1
"I have skin cancer and I bought this product on the recommendation of the dermatologist who treats me. I use this daily to cover any part of my body that will be exposed to the sun and a related product, elta MD UV Facial SPF30+ on my face (the UV Sport leaves a slightly oily residue on the face).

My wife also uses both products.

Both of us are active outdoor athletes (not necessarily talented and winning athletes, but we are in the mix). I play golf two or three days a week, bicycle everyday, hike and swim frequently (we have a pool) and enjoy other watersports like kayaking. And we live in Southern California, skin cancer capital of the world.

My dermatologist told me that any sunscreen that I use must have Zinc Oxide as its active ingredient and it must stay on. Most drugstore brand lotions do not use Zinc Oxide as their primary ingredient which may be why they are less expensive.

My wife additionally likes the UV Facial because it has a facial moisturizer (the UV Sport does not).

Having used it for two years I have found that despite the long and intense exposure that I get during golf and bicycling it provides substantial day-long protection - just like wearing clothing. One bit of advice though - you MUST put this on heavily if you want true protection (true of all sunscreens). I apply it so heavily on my arms and face (I use UV Sport on my face when I golf) that I can still see the white cream. It takes about 20 minutes to disappear. Anything less than that and you will be burning in spots in two hours or so.

The only downside is the higher cost but I think this is a case where you get what you pay for. After all, what is skin cancer worth?",1
Not sure if I got an old tube or if this just doesnt mix with my skin but it clumps and flakes on my skin even using a moisturizer underneath it. Im part greek and lean more towards oily skin so I thought this would be an excellent solution to wear under makeup for a matte finished look.  Not so much :/ unfortunately I cant return it.,0
I don't like it as much as the makeup that was sold at Costco.,0
"Smells great and is wonderful for moisturizing your nails & hands.  My bottle arrived leaking as the top was not taped up or sealed well for shipping, thus the tissue paper & bubble mailer absorbed some of the oil or I would have given this a 5 star.  I have used this oil for years & love it.  Locally it is difficult for me to locate.",1
amazing. great seller,1
"I've noticed a great difference, I would buy again!",1
Tube too small for the money!,0
did not work at all did not help make my hair grow at all even for using for three weeks everyday,0
Best hand cream ever. I have very dry hands and this one does the job. I've tried all other brands but Borghese is one of the only hand cream that thoroughly moisturizes my dry hands. It lasts for hours and hours.,1
"It arrived totally moldy. Absolutely disgusting. Photos here - [...]

I didn't realize it at first and ended up with a serious rash. Do not purchase.",0
"a rip off, no better than mass produced drugstore item, very little cream in tube",0
"I have used this product for years. It has changed from on the stove heat up wax to microwavable (not sure if that is a real word). The reason it gets a 4 and not a 5 star is because the company has reduced the wax amount but not the price. It does work. It works better on thicker hairs that are a little longer. Of course nothing is perfect but it is a good product. I have sensitive skin and use this product without much irritation. One suggestion, when it is almost out- put the remains in the freezer and you can knock all the excess on the edges to the bottom of the container for microwaving.",1
this smells awesome no doubt but product came in with some sort of leak in the top area ???? I got it way to early as Christmas present for my husband because I knew with a newborn I would not had time for shopping so for the same reason I wasn't even able to complaint nor return,0
Just got this in today. I did not like the look. It made my lips look dry. There is absolutely no moisture. I see by the reviews many others liked it. So obviously its just not for me. I did add a moisturizer  to it and it was ok looking but what I'm interested in is finding a.lipstick that requires only one step.,0
"bright, bold and beautiful for summer ",1
So gentle on your skin. Great experience,1
"The product pictured is described as the Super Rich Wash.  However, the item I received is the Original Wash, not what I wanted. Beware.",0
very gentile & does not cause any reaction to my very sensitive eyes.,1
I cannot find any nail file that is a dependable and easy on my nails as the OPI nail file. It is not easy to find locally and the price and shipping were reasonable.,1
i love it,1
"I have thick hair. After going through Crew Fiber, Crew Molding Putty, Tea Tree Shaping, Redken whatever, Tiki Wax, I finally found TD Clay. It's the Yeti of hair products as Amazon has it in stock occasionally and no one sells it around me. When I ran out of it and was on backorder I researched and found Man Made clay and purchased it. The jar was awesome. I couldn't wait to use my new clay the next day. Except it was not anything close to the consistency of clay. It feels lighter than the tea tree shaping cream. I needed a ton to get it to hold and my hair felt like it had a damaged bleach job instead of a natural hold. I also smelled like a retired sailor covered in bad cologne according to my significant other. Will be (sadly) going back to TD clay as it has a better hold, whenever it is in stock.",0
In the past (4 years ago) I had this curler and it worked great so I decided to order it again.  This time around I don't know what changed but the curler made my hair very frizzy plus it didn't even hold the curl. Returned it for another make & model.,0
"After using all of the towels, I didn't get any type of color to my skin at all. Would not recommend this product to anyone who wants an easy tan.",0
I have used it for a couple of years now and like it so far. Does a better job than most other products I had used before.,1
I am a busy working woman that just wants to come home and get my make up off and plop onto bed. With Bliss Make up remover I have to scrub my eyelids over and over wand rise and scrub up to 3-4 times..Don't bother.,0
Not the same product I bought as the the salon I go to. This was watery and didn't smell like the store bought one.,0
"I was a user of the original Nioxin for years with good results.  I stopped using it because I decided I didn't need it.  Now, thanks to customer reviews I have been spared experiencing the "" new"" version.  I am so disappointed that the formula has changed.
Thanks for all the reviews! BTW, has anyone found a satisfying replacement?",0
"I'm a big fan of pre-shave oils because they really do help my shave, probably more than any other product.  The first pre-shave oil I tried was Art of Shaving, which was great.  I like to try different products just to see if one might be better than the other or of better value if they work just the same.  The Zirh Prepare is no longer in the running.

It works just ok, when compared to the Art of Shaving pre-shave oil and the Anthony Logistics pre-shave oil.  The others do a better job of softening my facial hair.  Also, the others come in 2 ounce bottles.  When you do the math, the Zirh Prepare costs $16 per ounce, while the Art of Shaving is $11 and Anthony Logistics $9 per ounce.

It's a no brainer.  Take Zirh's PREPARE off your list.",0
"Ordered the green discs. They arried promptly, but were too short. I received the PMD device as a Christmas gift.  I loved it and needed to order replacement discs. I ordered these from Amazon instead of the device web site in the hopes of saving on shipping and based on other reviews. I received the discs and they were not the color of the ones I already had. That concerned me, but i thought well I don't care about the color. I got them home and put them on the device and they were too short. I pulled the disc up so it would extend closer to the opening, still too short. In order to get it anywhere near the opening it had to be lifted almost to the tip. It does swirl around, but does not seem to be as effective. I began to wonder if the abrasionon of the disc was inferior as well, but I think it is related to the fact the disc is so close to the tip it is not getting the full power of the device's rotation.

I have traiditonally had good luck with my Amazon purchases, so I purchased them again. Same results. Unfortauntely, I was out of town when they arrived and was unable to return them. I will not buy these again from Amazon. I am looking at the PMD web site for my next purchase.",0
I bought a bunch of these as Halloween gifts for my kids. 2 font work and the vinpmany will not return. That's terrible customer service,0
"When I saw Moroccan Myrrh I was expecting some deep, rich exotic spice. And, the packaging, with the little turn key? Man, I was hooked. But, it appears to be all marketing. What it actually has is a strong citrus smell reminiscent of something Axe or Old Spice might be offering. I'm sure there is some 14 year-old out there that can't wait until he's old enough to start shaving that would think this scent is the height of sophistication, but if your tastes are a little more refined please don't bother. OK, maybe that's a little unfair. But, it's definitely not more sophisticated than anything you could find at a typical drugstore.",0
Great product.,1
"Nice, silky soft, non-greasy protection. Not sure about the repair qualities, but it is a good sunscreen.",1
"I ordered this blow dryer, it worked great for a month & then it would not heat up, no matter which tempature chosen, it blew at a cold temp.  Would never buy this again.  Was not able to return it.",0
Great for traveling!,1
"Not for me. I've never used a dry shampoo before so I have nothing to compare it to. It makes my hair feel dirtier and a little gritty. This brand was recommended by my hair dresser. I like the feeling of my hair all clean and smooth and I guess that can't be recreated with a powder. Oh well, back to my regular morning routine. I will say that if I was trying to create an updo this would probably help give a lot of texture.",0
I have oily skin.  I like the way this looks when it's applied.  Very smooth and professional looking.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it's really too small for the price even if it is smooth and professional looking.  I may buy it again but I will still not be happy with the price:),1
Hello I want to track No.,0
Not oily at all and leaves skin feeling fresh,1
"While the price is great and the shades are gorgeous, it is very sticky/goopy upon application, and needs to be reapplied frequently.",1
More liquid then foam,0
I have been using this for almost a year and I love the smell and my hair feels amazing. I usually use this product before I blow dry my hair and my hair smells amazing for a few days. It doesn't get messy and it makes my hair less frizzy too.,1
This is by far the best dry shampoo I've ever used.,1
Love this. Melts into your skin and leaves no oily or sticky feeling behind. Feels great and doesn't break out my acne prone skin.,1
"She loves the stuff
She said it works",1
My favorite eye liner! Stays on all day.,1
"The sunscreen burns my eyes, leaving them red and itchy. which sucks since I wear sunscreen under my makeup. Wish I had read the return policy since this item is none refundable.",0
"This would be my first feedback on Amazon. This junk does not work. It smells horrific, used it enough to see results happen. They never did. My skin got worse . Would never purchase again. Wasted my money.",0
It does what I says but I found a cheap alternative.,1
I received a fake,0
"Great quality, light weight, heats up fast. Price was amazing.  This iron is the same kind my professional hair dresser uses...",1
"if you have dry sullen skin this is the one you need. no reaction and I have very sensitive skin. this with the .1 retinal from Avene has lifted, erased lines and given brightness as well as knocked a decade off my face!!",1
"smells good! like lemon and vanilla, but all my clothes gets white powder all over it.",1
the best candles out there!!  you get what you pay for:),1
"I have used almost every top brand hair care product on the market over the years and was very pleased with my Pureology, that is, until I tried Wen! I purchased the Intensive Hair Treatment in Sweet Almond on the recommendation from a friend to use on my very dry hair.  After only one use, not only did my hair feel wonderfully moisturized, but it took care of my scalp which had been itchy. I absolutely love this product and will be buying it again and again!  Also love the Amazon price!!",1
This is an awesome spray when bought elsewhere. This particular seller must've watered it down bc it was nothing like previously purchased Mario bedescu rose water spray,0
"This is a very good after shave balm. My skin really reacts well to it. If you have used Every Man Jack, or Art of Shaving you may prefer this. You don't need much and it really reinvigorates my skin after shaving.",1
I am forced to select a star but I personally would give none. Package was not sealed when I received it. The last two times I have ordered this shampoo from this distributor it has been a slow process into making me bold. I have lost tons of hair and now I have a really bad case of dandruff on top of extremely dry hair.,0
this lipstick is horrible!!!! is greasy and is not even red i got the color all ready taken and is like a hot orange and doesn't even look like a red. its almost the same price for the mac red lipstick in which i rather buy than waste my money on a horrible product. maybe next time michelle should be careful on her products. i totally hate the color of the lipstick is nasty feeling and not worth it!!!!! DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!,0
A little dark for being considered dark brown it reminds me more of color 1B which is like off black. It till worked for what I needed it for but just be cautious if you have more brown in your hair this might not blend exactly.,1
Wish Stila had more colors. But I like this very much.,1
It leaves my hair dry I only used it once.  I will use it again.,0
"I was complimenting a friend's eye makeup, something I usually would never mention, but she just looked great.  She told me about this Vincent Longo trio, and later sent me a link.  Since she's a green-eyed blonde, and I'm a brown-eyed brunette, I wasn't sure the colors would work as well for me, but decided to give it a try.  They're great!  The colors are extremely versatile, and they stay put on the lid.  I'm a believer!",1
This stuff is HARSH on the skin! It wound up drying out my face so much so that my face was red for WEEKS after just ONE use and I had to get a shot at the emergency room to make it finally start to go away!,0
Didn't plump and not very much product for price and the twist bottom feature kept popping off,0
"Worked great on first tube, then ran out. Reordered and it didn't seem to last nearly 3 months and didn't seem as effective. I switched brands to Revitalash",1
"They changed the formula or something, not a fan of the new stuff.",0
"I ordered this because I like Bliss products and enjoy a nice scrub. Before I ordered I noticed several people commented on the smell and I thought ""Well, of course it has a smell there is rosemary and eucalyptus!"" The smell is NOT like either rosemary or eucalyptus both of which I raise. It is like - of all things - industrial strength bathroom cleaner. This smells exactly like many showers I used back in days of gym and basketball. Not a spa like smell at all. My first disappointing Bliss purchase. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.",0
Works but really any better than any other products A fraction of the price,0
"After using it for a few days, my skin dried out and broke out even more.",0
"THIS HAIR DRYER WORKED WELL FOR A FEW MONTHS AND THEN IT STARTED TO LOSE STRENGTH AND WOULD STRUGGLE TO HEAT UP AND WORK FULL STRENGTH.  NOW IT IS SHORTING OUT DURING USE.  I LOVE ALL OF THE MOROCCANOIL PRODUCTS I HAVE PURCHASED AND ASSUMED THIS WOULD BE A GREAT, LIGHTWEIGHT HAIR DRYER.
WAITING TO HEAR FROM THE SELLER TO SEE IF THEY WILL SEND ME A REPLACEMENT, IT SHOULDN'T BREAK AFTER 5 MONTHS.  I HAVE HAD CONAIRS FROM THE DRUG STORE LAST LONGER AND WORK BETTER. QUITE DISAPPOINTED. WILL KEEP YOU POSTED",0
"Found the product to be too greasy and thick. When applied it did not leave the hair looking fuller. It is closer to a putty than a clay in that it tends to bind small clusters of hair together instead of thickening each strand. It also has a light shine to it, which is not a surprise given the greasy feel. The two other products I compared this against were far superior - Smooth Viking and 18.21.",0
Absolutely love this dryer and cannot live without.,1
Didn't notice any difference in my skin condition. I've got some dark spots and fine lines and neither were improved after a month of use.,0
"It sprays well and evenly. It doesn't gunk up and my hair is not left too stiff. It holds relatively well.
But, the scent is strong and persistent, especially right after you sprays it. It goes away after some time but you still get a whiff of it once in awhile through out the day. Then, when you are just about to forget about it, you get another strong whiff while you are trying to wash your hair in the shower. And it's strong enough for me to cringe a bit.
It could be that my tolerance for fragrance has gone down considerable since I've started using products with less or no fragrance and stop using cologne since having babies in the house for past few years... but I have used other hairspray with some fragrance in them and it didn't cause me to such adverse reaction to it.",0
"Not 5 stars in terms of value.

At Amazon...
Blistex is 2% as much.
Chapstick same.
Vaseline lip therapy same.

Malin + Goetz is 50 times better?
It's not.  It can't be.
Consider value, not hyperbole.

"I love the smell off it, I don't if it helps yet caz I used it for only 2 weeks.",1
Didn't work for me.  Didn't brighten my undereye circles in any way unlike a few other creams (Ahava/Clinique/Estee Lauder).,0
"This styling brush is, I'm guessing, a much more effective tool in the hands of a professional stylist than in my hands, but with practice, I am handling it better for last-minute polishing of my hair. It's not a flat iron. It's more like a regular brush with heat to give you waves or curls, if you're starting with straight hair; volume, if your hair is flat or somewhat straighter hair, if you have curls you'd like to smooth. Be careful how you handle this tool, because it get hot.

I like that it's easy to regular the temperature. My advice is to start with the lower temperature, see if your hair responds, and only turn up the heat if necessary.",1
"This thing worked one time. The next day, I plugged it in, turned it on and NOTHING! No heat. Light was on...just never got hot again. Returned and bought a cheap Conair which works like a charm everytime.",0
"I take a couple of meds that dry me out bad.  One is allergy meds and during the high pollen sometimes I have to take a benedryl in addition and when I do I practically wake up in the morning with bleeding lips. I yawn and whammo, cracked, bleeding lips.  I've increase my water intake to help combat this, which does help, but this lip balm is the rest of the fix.  I've tried several other medicated lip balms, Burts Bees was the best for me in the past, but this one far surpasses that.  I still like BB products, but this lip balm is now my permanent choice.  I'm getting another two tubes now because I keep one by my bed to apply at night and one on my desk for day time use.  I may apply more than most because I cannot stand the way my lips feel if they are dry at all.  That being said, I probably use it faster than most, and am willing to pay for extra. All in all, the product is very worth the money.  Everything doesn't work for everyone, so you have to try if for yourself, but I love this product.  It does have a shimmery whiteness to it. It is slight, but I'm not sure a man would find that to his liking.  I like it because I don't wear makeup and it gives some life to my lips in general. Unfortunately, to find out if it works for you, you have to spend the money.  That is just the way of the world, but hopefully my review helps you make a decision.  Thank you!",1
It does cover your scalp. It is more of a dark brown.,1
This is the BEST  so far......,1
"GREAT COLOR, especially for the Holidays...paired with OPI GREEN ON THE RUNWAY...FAB!!!",1
It doesn't work at all. How could I return and get refund?,0
Love it. Keeps your winter skin flawless.,1
"I feel certain this may be a good product, although when received I could not get it to spray... It was defective in manufacturing",0
The strawberry smoothie nail shellac is a very light product in fact almost white with the faintest pink color.  I do wear and like light colors but this one is almost too light.,0
I was a big fan of this gum until they changed to the xylitol sweeter. I bought it regularly and it seems to help the whitening a bit but I just liked it. I didn't realize the formula had changed --I just thought the wrappers were new. I immediately spit it out the new gum. I hope they bring back the old gum or at least give customers a choice.......bummer!,0
Nioxin is a.good product,0
I didn't rate 5 stars because it causes me to breakout if I use it by itself so I used it on top of my other makeup. Love how it shines lightly,1
"My skin has multiple personalities.  It's oily, sensitive, gets easily irritated and breaks out, gets dry flaky patches, and no matter what cleanser I use, something (the oiliness or the dryness) gets aggravated.  For years, I've stuck with my trusty Cetaphil cleanser and tested other products in between.  My Mom actually gave me this cleanser after I house sat for her and used it and I'm SO glad I tried it.  I absolutely love, love, love this cleanser.  It cleans without stripping my skin, without making my face feel tight, and it takes off every trace of make up including eye make up and mascara. My face is soft and smooth with no dryness, no irritation, and it doesn't feel greasy that way it did with some other gel/cream based cleansers.

About once a week, I leave a bit of the cleanser on my face for 5 minutes to let the enzyme magic do it's thing.  I have no blackheads, not even on my oily t-zone area.  It works really well with the rest of my skin care regiment, and lasts forever!  My first bottle has lasted me 6 months.  Only a little bit is needed, and really, it's not that expensive when you consider how long it lasts, or the great things it does for your skin.",1
I love the smell of this product and the way it makes your head tingle.,1
over rated.,0
"This foundation is lighter than the Dermablend Mousse and takes more to get full coverage.  It also leaves my face feeling more oily than the mousse but not enough to create a shine or make my glasses slide off.  The coverage is smooth with no lines or streaks.  The directions on the bottle are for sunscreen and not for applying makeup but the description on the amazon page gives good instruction for the novice.  I applied a light powder over the top and have received several comments that I look really nice today, in spite of wearing a t-shirt and jeans.  This foundation did a pretty good job covering the blotches and red spots I have from rosacea.",1
"However, it is more expensive. Not worth the extra money. I tried it, my husband tried it.... we really gave it a shot hoping it would work for us but alas...",0
Great for sensitive eyes. Good price here vs. beauty supply stores.,1
"I had very high hopes for this iron, but it sucks! I'm used to the clipless curling irons but I figured I'd give this one a try. It took me FOREVER to do my hair and the curl didn't hold AT ALL. By the time I was done the hair on the bottom was already almost straight. My hair holds curls really well so I don't understand. I will surely be returning it.",0
Very drying. Used until gone as directed. Did not increase hair growth or fullness.,0
"Wonderful product, leaves my hair looking great.",1
This stuff is too thick to spread.  I have to cut it with lotion just to get it to go on my skin.  I like the smell though and it keeps me from getting burned.,0
When will I learn to listen to the reviews. Broken into a million pieces and made a mess on my counter. Returning it. Do yourself a favor and just go to ulta.,0
"I used this product twice a day for nearly a month.  In the morning to cleanse, and at night to moisturize after a deep clean.  After a while I noticed my pores had some pale clogs.  There is no information in the bottle about what is used as a base oil, and although there is a great deal said about the Damascus Rose essential oil, theses no info on if they use the true essential oil and what else they dilute it with.  I have Damascus Rose essential oil, its very expensive and is used sparingly in my own aroma therapy. This product neither smells nor acts like the true oil.  Its either very dilute with lots of other stuff, or they don't use the true oil, but a byproduct instead.

I don't recommend this",0
This is a fake item. DO NOT BUY.,0
"I ended up giving this powder to someone else. Something is off about this product, and it's appx. two shades darker - more like Honey Medium. I picked up Honey Fair from my spa, and the color is accurate. Also, the powder is very fine/not as grainy as what I got on Amazon. Buyer beware.",0
I started to lose hair using this product,0
"Poor value not close to be worth 20 bucks much less 10, sizes too small, brush too small, sshipping too expensive for the size.",0
This stuff is a must for my hair. Keeps my ends from being super dry and helps with the fly aways I get!,1
"Don't like feel or smell. Is too thick.
Also slightly burns.",0
Only thing my poor acne prone teen uses that doesn't irritate his skin. A little bit goes a long way.,1
"Daughter likes it, has a nice aroma to it.  But hair not like you been swimming in the ocean like ad claims",0
Hated it.  This lotion is thin and smells like rancid oil.  Not at all worth the price.  Very unhappy.,0
"Love the scent, not to sure that I would call it a great option for exfoliating your skin.",0
"I have never seen better results for overall skin quality in such a short amount of time.  I've used it twice, I'm hooked.  It's thick and goes on smoothly, no perfume smell.  Can't wait to see my skin in a month.",1
Did not cover well and did not last all day.,0
"The shipping took a while but it came as estimated within the window. The product makes you smell like after sun and you are a pinch sticky. Easy application. Didn't give me as good as a ""tan"" as the foam. The St Tropez foam is still the better product.",0
"Doesnt work.
Dont buy.",0
"This is fake OPI polish. I got this color because I saw a Pinterest post about it and was so disappointed when I used it that it looked nothing like the picture. I went and purchased the same color and OPI brand from ULTA and compared the two, look nothing alike. Color is totally off and the labeling is off as well. I ordered the color Passion for reference and have posted a picture. The left is from this seller and right is from ULTA.",0
For PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY!!!!!!!!,0
"Best cleansing gel, no soap- brilliant for my delicate skin, leaves a very clean face without too much hassle. I had been looking for a no-soap face wash to remove make up, and this one has exceeded my expectations. Will buy again and again!",1
This is  our 2nd bottle after the first tube was used. Way better than our previous face sunscreen. Very satisfied.,1
I really love at least one of the other Jane Iredale lip products but I have to agree that the lemon scent/flavor is too strong. The formula is smooth and moisturizing and I like the tint but won't be buying it again unless they offer a non-fragranced choice.,0
"This is a very nice body wash for my very sensitive skin. While Jack Black products are mainly tailored for men, this item can be used by women as well, and is so indicated on the packaging. The scent is very herbal, much like what you'd find at a spa. It has multiple herbs as ingredients, including ginger, lemongrass and verbena; as well as various oils to moisten and soften the skin.

It lathers well. I only use two pumps on my sponge to create plenty of lather for a full shower cleanse.

This item would probably be considered a luxury item by many rather than a daily use body wash, because it is quite expensive. The 12 oz. bottle is priced at $26, which is about 4-5 times more expensive than your everyday name or generic brand. Still, if you want to pamper yourself, give this one a try.",1
"I like the luminizing one better (even though I tend to have slightly oiler skin), but this one comes in a close second. If you like Loreal's new Magic Nude liquid-to-powder This is a higher quality version on steroids.
When you first put on, it's the wrong color, and feels slightly gritty.

I don't know what that's about, but give it about 2-5 min. Do your hair, whatever.

When you give it a little time, it ends up looking beautiful and matte. For me, it ends up looking very much like, matte, natural skin like finish-not a flat color at all. It also has a very med-high coverage. You will be amazed.

I alternate between the two, and sometimes mix this one with my luminizing moisture tint for more of a satin finish. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a beautiful, not overly heavy foundation.",1
Proctor and Gamble change the ingredients when they bought Nioxin and it no longer works as well.,0
"This is a pleasantly-scented eye cream that does provide some temporary lift. There is no allergic reaction, no itching or burning, either.  The cream absorbs quickly. The tube has a very small opening, so only a little can come out at a time.  Not much is needed to lift the sagging skin around the eyes.  For me the price is cost-prohibitive, though.",1
"This works well, but is truly a mini.  I have fine straight hair and it works well for touch ups, but I can't imagine trying to straighten a whole head of curly hair.",1
"Product appeared to be in new condition but would not turn on. It was dead on arrival and returned, I should have dug a little deeper into the reviews...",0
"not really usefully, so sticky, makes you feel you are carrying tones of hair on your head...",0
"My hair is on the thin side and I felt that it made my hair a little ""crunchy"" feeling.  I like the Maximista thickening hair spray  a lot better.  Maybe I used too much.  Now I just use this on the back of my head.",0
very nice,1
"I thought this was the same cleanser I have bought in the past: Epicuren Herbal Cleanser. However it is  ""Citrus"" and much too acidic for the skin on my face. I will find some other use for it or give it away.",0
This parfum is for my husband he likes it so much.  He has using all the different boucheron since about 10 years or more and love it.,1
I have been buying glo-minerals for several years. I bought this blush and the packaging was not the same at all. This was not an authentic product. The round sticker on the back should be silver with numbers imprinted onto it.  The blush I received was a cheap white printed sticker with no numbers.,0
"I ordered taupe because lighter shades are rare when it comes to mascara and eyebrow pencils and my hair, brows and lashes are a light brownish grey.  This product is OK, but a bit too dark for my coloring - actually a dark brown that is kind of garish.  It is really easy to apply more than you need, so if you are lighter complected then you might be happier with a blonde shade if you can find it.

The little eyebrow  brush on the lid is a bit difficult to use because the lid is pretty small and awkward when it is off  the pencil, and it swivels around when it is on.  I'd rather just have a stand-alone brush, but this will do in a pinch.

For darker complexions this is fine.  If you are fair or gray, keep looking.",0
This is definitely not what I have bought for years in stores.  It has a very strong perfume odor and does NOT hold my hair at all. I bought 3 cans and will be trying to return it and never buy again from this dealer.  Hope Amazon gets smart and drops them.  It is a good price for a terrible product.  The REAL w8less is my favorite hair spray.,0
Not as advertised,0
"Not impressed, in my opinion this is just average whitening toothpaste. Over the counter whitening  toothpaste does the same job for a lot less money.",0
"I like wearing neutral color on my nails and I usually love Essie.  I went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  I was disappointed with the product.  It goes on with lots of streaks.  It needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  I stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  I doubt that I would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but I will experiment.  It is a good color for the office, but I still wish that it was less ""watery"".",0
good,1
"I would never buy one of these again online.  This item arrived and it took a few uses to understand why the thing seemed to damage my hair.  The two sides of the hot pad area are not parallel, the end of the heated area touches before the other 3/4 of it.  In order to flat iron you have to press hard enough so the whole area is in contact with your hair but ... the area that touches first is then too pinched and it pulls your hair.  I ended up putting it in a vice with a piece of wood at the end and left it there for a period of time and both sides ended up parallel.  I used it and couldn't believe how nice it ran through my hair but ... next time I used it, it went back to the original condition and is now once again .. useless..  If not for this problem it would be a great little iron.",0
"Very disappointed in the new formula. Creamier and heavier but doesn't control as well as the old formula.  It smells terrible-minty, nutty, herbal and makes me sneeze. Trying to be like Phyto 7 but misses. I miss the lighter fresh smelling formula. It was my favorite. Won't buy this again.",0
I have been using this brand for some time.  It is the best hot air brush I have found,1
Absolutely no change of color on my skin. Nothing.,0
"The first time I applied this serum, I dispensed too much and it felt thick and goopy on my skin.  The next morning I used about half that amount with much better results.  It does leave a matte finish  (great during summer when products described as ""dewy"" or ""luminous"" make me look sweaty and oily) but doesn't make my skin feel dry.  While this is called a serum it feels like a primer, but since I don't wear a lot of makeup, I can't comment on how it performs under makeup.  What I can say is, that applying sunscreen on top messes up the matte finish and leaves me looking shiny but I'm not sure if applying sunscreen underneath interferes with the absorption of the skin nourishing ingredients.  Would have been a lot easier if they just put sunscreen in the product.  It does make my skin feel super soft, even when I don't use it everyday, but I'm thinking of putting this away till Fall/Winter when I'm not sweating and reapplying high SPF sunscreen all day.  I mean why waste it.",1
"My  aesthetician sold me this cleanser, the eye cream, and moisturizer and I ordered refills on Amazon at a better price. I used this stuff for about two years and it was definitely a good quality product. I have rosecea and it did soothe my skin. However, post baby my skin was a MESS and I found this to be less effective in healing (although fabulous in maintaining). I've since switched over to Rodan & Fields which was the ONLY product that cleared up my hormonally challenged nightmare of a skin situation. I'm not a Rodan & Fields consultant and have no ties to the company. If your skin is in decent shape, this is a good quality product for the price and I highly recommend it.",1
"This is a great product,  however mine arrived broken open and conditioner spilled out all over.  It was a waste of 1/4 of the bottle.  I'm not happy",0
It wasn't red on my skin. It was advertised as red but shows as orange instead.,0
"This smells really good but has caused a severe allergic reaction to my face. My face is tight, hot to the touch and has a horrible rash. Itches horribly. I wish I could recommend but if you have sensitive skin I would stay away from this product.",0
This device did not work for me. I don't know why. There was no difference in my skin. It could be because i was pregnant when i bought it and my skin is not its best when am pregnant. So i had to return it before the end of the 30 days return. I could not keep it until i give birth to know if it did not work because of pregnancy. So it might be because of the baby. I don't know . But it did not work for me.,0
"It is a very lightly colored eyeshadow, just adds a bit of glimmer to my lid (my skin is very pale).  It goes on pretty smoothly. I'll have to wear it more to really know how long it has the potential to last though.

My only real complaint is that it is a little tricky to open (its completely adorable--really, I love the sort of artsy graphic on the case). The catch is really firmly latched.",1
I love the Eyeko Black Drama and Curl but wanted to try this one since it was Sport and Waterproof. It was nothing like I expected. It flaked off nor did do a whole lot for my lashes. I buy this kind because I live in the hot and humid south. I was very disappointed in this product. I expected much more for the money I spent from Eyeko. Maybe it was an old product? I just know that a 7.00 tube of Maybelline is better than this one was.,0
"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1
"I like it very much, does do the difference if you just follow through with face wash, cream, serum and of course sunscreen, don't give up, keep using it !!!",1
"My wife says it's a little too much like Polo but I think it has a more distinct, modern scent.",1
"I am so sorry to say that the only thing this product did was give me hundreds of skin tags now on my neck that I can't seem to get rid of.  So ugly, I hate them!",0
Love this product,1
Love this product! its very liquid so I also use it to wet my hair before using the dryer when I didn't wash it before.,1
"This sunscreen it wonderful.  It has zinc oxide and  absorbs quickly. I love the mouse texture of the product and it moisturizers your skin without being greasy. There is no white residue. What I LOVE the most is that it does not sting my eyes or leave a ""taste"" in my mouth. The scent is pleasant and it is a great product for  people with sensitive skin. Wears great under make up as well. Its worth spending a little more for a quality product. Great for skin that needs to be protected while using Retin-a. Love it !",1
Its too obvious when worn,0
I got this as a sample from sephora. I decided this was something I would buy again. It has a clean medicinal scent and I think it can do things for hands and difficult spots( never your face) yet to be tested. My son had poison ivy on his elbow and he tried unit . It cleared up 2 days later !!!,1
"Its cute and light weight, but it isn't a one time through.  And it turns brown after a few months",0
Been using the products for about a month now and my hair looks thicker and is shedding less.  This is a Great product!!,1
I love this! Makes my hair feel so soft and healthy. Just a little amount goes a long way. I just have to run some through my hair while its damp and it protects it from the heat when I blow dry. It has a slight scent but its nice.,1
This product did not work for me. I saw no difference in my hair after using the entire package. I liked the delivery system; it was easy to use.,0
"Conditioner leaked in box. It was in a plastic bags, but still was a huge mess and lost product.",0
Great product. No mess. Even tan look. Odorless. Well packaged and fast delivery.,1
I don't understand the positive reviews. This cleansing conditioner does not condition. It strips my hair and leaves it dry. Not to mention it smells like bathroom cleaner. Not a fan. May not have been a genuine product? Dunno.,0
I thought it was great until I tried 100% argon oil by Watts Beauty which is comparable in price. I,0
"I have used La roche Posay in the past. I was experiencing some pretty bad breakouts, so I figured I would give this set a try. After two days of use I broke out in a itchy red rash, with tons of tiny bumps. It started on my forehead, spread all over my face and caused my eyes to swell shut. I had to go to a dermatologist and I received two shots of hydrocortisone. The derm said it was from the alcohol content in the products. If you have sensitivities to alcohol I would not suggest using this kit. Its now been 5 days since using the products, my skin is now peeling off and still has lots of tiny bumps/blisters. Super disappointed I had to go through this from using this set.
What I also thought was interesting about the set is all of the items say do not use with other products that contain salicylic acid yet all of the products contain salicylic acid. Almost makes me think these products should be used alone, not as a trio.",0
Dislike this color.  Goes on streaked.,0
"The day it arrived I was so excited to use it based on the one review it received.  It came already sharpened, so I began to apply it and the tip snapped off. Oh well I thought, I will re-sharpen it and try again.  So I re-sharpened it and began to apply it and the tip fell off again!  This happened 4 times before I figured out that I was going to have to only sharpen it until it was just above the wood or it was going to snap off time after time.  So now I am forced to use it barely sharpened, which means the supporting wood is hitting/scratching your eyelid and you know how comfortable THAT is.  It also means that I don't get a nice, smooth line, since I don't have a sharpened point so the color ""skips"".  I would not recommend this to anyone and will not be buying again.",0
"Have used Chi hair products for years; this is the first one that I do not like.  It has no heat control on it--gets way too hot, especially for my silver locks that no longer need or want much heat.  My previous Chi curling iron (which finally died after ""years"" of much appreciated daily work) was almost identical to this one, but it had the obviously needed/desired heat control switch.  Why would anyone not want the ability to select the right amount of heat for his/her hair type???  This one gets extremely hot in a very short period of time--could easily damage hair!!!",0
"Great product if you like a wand , I could not figure it out but quality was exceptional.",1
"The only reason I don't like this is because of the smell. It reminds me of citronella for mosquitoes. Maybe I'm crazy, but I just felt it was way too strong and I didn't even put that much in. Other than that, it does work.",0
"I recieved a sample of this through Birchbox, and it has a great lather and divine smell!  I really liked it, it was like being pampered in a salon when I used it while taking a bath.",1
I really like the sandalwood smell of this shaving soap. It isn't overpowering but leaves a nice scent. The soap lathers very nicely and  my face has felt better since switching from the other stuff I was using. I will probably stick with Prosaso for a while.,1
"I purchased this brush about four months ago. Well, my daughter came for a visit, borrowed and loved this brush, so I gave it to her. I thought I would just replace it with a ""Walmart"" brush, no big deal. Well, apparently I loved it as well, because no other brush compared. So, I just purchased me a replacement brush and won't be giving it to nobody. It's a pricey brush, but worth it IMO!",1
Expensive and not very fragrant. I am disappointed.,0
It has been very effective in reducing my lower back pains and stiffness for about 15 years.,1
After having the hand lotion and reading the reviews for this shower gel I bought two $66.00 plus! One was a gift the other I just used and the smell is terrible!!! Maybe I got a bad batch???! I'm so sorry I got this for myself and a gift!!! I waisted a lot of money for something I can not use! ;-((,0
"Very very nice. The only reason I don't give it is a 5 is that the top is very restricted, and you can only get a drop or two at a time. I suppose that is better than being too wide, where you might be apt to spill it. Very lovely scent.",1
My wife has been using this product for many years.  There is no other on the market that matches its quality.,1
"My hair is extremely thin, and thus stuff us magical, I cannot go in public without it, a hat, or wig.  I've worn it only in decent weather (not hot or rainy), so I'm not sure what will happen when I sweat.  It's super easy and washes out very easy, I don't find it messy at all.",1
Definitely creates a thicker appearance to thinning hair!,1
"I own a mason Pearson popular mixture brush already for myself but my girls wanted to have one of their own in their room so I ordered one from Amazon. When the package arrived I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was not of the same quality as the one I have and looked like it was made in China or something.
It's a total knock-off. Can't believe it!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"I bought this product hoping to strengthen my nails but all it did was peel off. This is a normal problem for me with all nail lacquers and polishes. Unfortunately, my nails are still soft and peeling.",0
"Not miraculous, but I can see improvement.",1
Recommended by my dermatologist and I see results,1
"Seems fine for my sensitive skin, but I don't like the smell. If it was fragrance free I might rate it better.",0
I have been using this moisturizer for 2 years now. It is simply the best of the best. It does everything the label says...perfect for winter months. I use it in the am and pm.,1
I really love Nectifirm.  I have been using it for over a year and I think it keeps my neck from looking old and wrinkly.  My skin  soft and supple and before it was starting to look very wrinkled.,1
Super shiny top coat!,1
"I got this for a male friend of mine who is thinning on top and  who also had past hair transplants done years ago, In that area he  has some small  hair  growing in. So I got him this  to help fill in those sparse areas remaining around the transplanted hair in the front hair line to help camouflage and fill in. I even put it on for him. because I could  obviously see the top of his head better than he could to try to sprinkle it on lightly and I'm a female and I'm used to messing with various hair products and cosmetics, so this should have been easier for me to do! I can't imagine someone trying to do this themselves....Well, this stuff went on in clumps even when trying to only use a small amount. His front hair line around the circular scars from the transplants this stuff just built up in those areas and made them even more noticeable. Like little dark brown circles..  so It was was thicker there than it was  on his ""regular"" scalp area around those  scars... that made it look terrible .!!  Well then I tried it on the crown of his head where he  has min to Moderate hair thinning, and  he doesn't  have any scars from transplants in that area... well that wasn't much better.
 Again it went on too thick and Looked so fake...To me what it is similar too is taking a course body powder and adding hair coloring to it and  then sprinkling it on your head. (actually I'm sure that concoction would be a lot cheaper, and  would have about the same affect) Basically,  It didn't look good at all.  It may cover if a person has very very little  hair thinning ..to just give the illusion of thicker hair by darkening the scalp area . But, I wouldn't even use it for that, because  the other down side, when he moved his head it just fell off like dandruff would  and came down over the front of his forehead almost to his eye brows.  When he tried to clean it off it just smeared..he had to totally shower to get it off his head and off his shoulders and forehead where it flaked off his head. He looked like he just came out of the coal mines.  geez..this stuff is horrible.
 I don't know if it's returnable or not. But, I only bought the small container first just in case he didn't like it. So it would probably cost more to send it back than it's worth..AVOID THIS PRODUCT...! Is my advice, I would not recommend at all.  It looks fake and I'm sure if a man would move around a lot it would flake off and also if he would sweat or get caught in the rain or go swimming. it would probably run down his face, how embarrassing would that be?? I bought this because it had some good reviews and I'm not sure why some people like it..!!  I think if someone wants to cover the white part of their scalp that is showing through their thinning hair,  it may be best to look for something that stains the skin temporarily..and only washes off with soap and water..I don't know if anyone makes such a product, But that may be a thought for a new product. Or maybe just use a self tanning product to darken the scalp.  May have to have him try that...lol
AVOID AVOID AVOID...IT'S JUNK, NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY..!! I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE ACTUALLY MAKES MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT AND THAT ANYONE WOULD BUY IT MORE THAN ONE TIME.  !",0
"As with most eye creams, this didn't improve the look of my dark circles at all.",0
It's very tiny. Hard to keep it running because you need to continuously press the button and it's complicated because it's so small. The material is very soft though and cleans the face well. For me it doesn't make any sense the vibration it feels weird on my face. I'm glad I tried this inexpensive one and didn't buy the regular one.,0
Topic is a great product for someone who has thinning hair.  You sprinkle it on your thinning area and it camaflouges the spot.,1
:-),1
"I purchased this face wash based on a friend's recommendation. She bragged about it's scent and the fact that it is made of natural ingredients. It smelled great and I was looking to try a new product so I went to the Korres store in SoHo and picked it up.

While I still liked the smell after purchasing, I found that it dried out my skin and made me break out. I have very sensitive skin and even clinique sometimes irritates it. I'm not a scientist by any means but there are certain products that leave my skin worse off. This face wash has been added to that list.

I would not buy this again but I really like the Korres lip butter, so I am open to trying their other products. This face wash was just not for me.",0
I wound up returning this. Didn't heat up as much as I thought and did not straighten my hair. I have shoulder length coarse hair and my arms gave out trying to straighten it.,0
"Gooey, large particles, would not stick to my scalp. Returned product.",0
This product is great but this is the way it arrived.... spilled all over the wrapping and the top of the bottle is broken.,0
Love it and could feel it working !!! It cleared my my complexion after just 2 uses and I have cystic pimples when I get them. Comes highly recommended. The product got to me late but we had a huge snowstorm so understandable :) product speaks for itself,1
"I loved the idea of using a volumizing AND texture powder in one bottle...and using in on dry hair? Sadly after 4 uses, it seems like the volume lasted only as long as the cooling effect it had on my scalp (two-five minutes) will not be purchasing again.",0
The product arrived unboxed and when I opened it up it was all smashed up and fell out all over me.  It was a huge mess!!,0
"I see no difference whatsoever, and it ""rolls"" off my face when I touch it after applying.",0
"The after shave balm is great but it came broken, have to return item.",0
Great product and excellent price. This is my 5th time ordering the product. Love it......,1
Terrible reaction! Chemical burn with irritation redness swelling and peeling under my eyes! It's been 2 weeks and didn't heal yet. It has been second time arond try. Terrible terrible wrinkles. NEVER have had any allergy on anything. I beg you to not even try this product. I don't know how to heal my skin after this cream. Embarrassed to go outside.,0
"Came inside a plastic bag with half the bottle spilled everywhere and the box came wet. My rose water and cucumber water ugh. Next time Im not buying this online anymore the kids weren't even full screwed on.

I ordered rose water, cucumber water, glycolic toner and orange cleansing soap and 3 out of 4 bottles cake leaking. Horrible only the orange cleansing soap didn't leak because its ticker formula",0
This base is a great product. It looks natural and provides additional sun protection. It lasts well and is a good value.,1
great love it,1
"Been looking for a good toner and this was one that just didn't cut it for me. It's strange that it's a makeup remover too..? I would never leave makeup remover on my face so I don't really understand how this is a true toner. Anyways, I used this until I found my perfect toner Mario Badescu Facial Spray",0
"The color is too dark, and it did not last a week",0
I was disappointed with this product. I love all Chi products but for some reason this just wasn't curling my hair as well as other products have. I am returning it.,0
it was just what i wanted,1
"terrific shaving cream! conditions your face, with a slight refreshing scent. Tub lasts a long time..",1
With this product I never have to wear foundation. It feels light and airy. I can wear it all day and may be reapply and touch up once throughout the day. Very easy to blend with skin tone. I receive numerous compliments when I where Pur Minerals. And I love their blush blend.,1
Not  cover,0
"make sure you are in a well vented area when you use this product.  But it was recommended by my cousin and I think it controls my back breakouts at bay. I also use on my arm and chest once a day.  I especially use it after working out and definitely after every shower.  I ordered several other products from gluytone and lets see how it goes.

I would recommend it.",1
"It is a very bed product and so misrepresented.  The  worst top coat I have ever used.  It bubbles on the nails a lot. I used it 3 times just to make sure that it was not my nail polish  but the actual top coat that is at fault. I had to apply a different top coat to correct the manicure.  Very disappointing. Maybe if you buy it in a salon it would be different,  I did not try. I am going back to the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Nail Coat.",0
"This is definitely a fake OPI nail polish.  The bottle is slightly different, font is not the same and wording is not the same as other authentic bottles.  Really disappointed",0
Worked nice for a while then my nails started flaking. Before that though my nails got very strong. I ride horses and although I had healthy nails I would still end up breaking a few when I rode. With this I was able to maintain long strong nails and continue my riding habit.,1
"Well made piece of hardware. Heavy and solid feel. Makes shaving easy with the weight of the razor doing all of the work. I would give 5 stars, but the only drawback for me is the smoothness of the handle. It gets a little slippery when your hands are wet. The stand, brush and dish are just as well made. The frosted glass helps hide any residue left from the shaving cream. An overall clean look to the set.",1
"I love this CHI product, it leaves my hair very soft and silky. I used to buy at my hair salon, but thought I'd get a better deal online, and I did. I paid a lot less ordering on Amazon, but in turn I think this is a fake.

When I received the product I noticed the bottle was a slightly different color than my salon-bought one. Then once I started using the product I noticed it was also different. The treatment had a clearer color, and was less thick, seemed more watered-down. I noticed that it's also not leaving my hair as silky.

So all in all, I recommend the CHI solution, but it's probably best to buy it at a hair salon or a cosmetic store, NOT online. I'm hoping to contact Amazon and see what I can do about this ""fake"" treatment.",0
Good product.,1
I have extremely dry skin and this moisturizer smooths on and is absorbed by my skin. I haven't seen any flaking since Ive been using it.,1
While staying at the Double Tree hotel. We enjoyed the scented lotion and shampoos they provided. So I had to look you up and ordered. My husband and I really love the smell. Thank you.,1
May be good for your nails but the amount - at least in the bottle that I got - lasted only for about a week. I used one pearl-sized drop on each hand twice a day. Will not buy it again.,0
"This is a great razor. I got the gold just for the looks but this is a great shaver. The Jagger DE 89 is very similar and a great razor also but this Merkur seems easier to find the right angle and feels more comfortable in my hand. I have never had this razor slip from my hand like happened with the EJ 89 lined handle. Out of the 6 razors I own, I use merkur HD the most. I noticed the price has dropped since I bought this razor about 6 months ago. When I bought my razor, I looked all over the internet but couldn't beat Amazon's prices. If you are considering buying another razor I highly recommend this razor from Amazon.",1
Love this brush cleanser! Works great with all of my brushes and leaves them soft. Dries quickly and removes even tough makeup.,1
"When my beloved decade old Conair bit the dust, I was excited to upgrade to Babybliss. The dryer itself has a nice long cord and appears to be very sturdy. I also appreciated that it came in black rather than neon. But after a couple weeks of use I had to return it. Here's why:

1. The attachment popped off too easily.
2. There is no way to comfortably hold this thing without switching the buttons inadvertently.
3. With my old dryer, it was pleasantly warm to sit under the heat while I dried my hair in winter. Despite the three heat settings, this dryer either burns or feels cool.
4. Although the motor is very powerful, it actually took longer to dry my thin, fine hair, regardless of settings, thus causing my hair to be damaged more quickly. (I'm not sure what to attribute this to except that maybe the force of the wind was so strong that my hair was blown out of the way and couldn't dry well? Just a guess...)
5. I never had such absurdly tangled hair in my life as I did after using this contraption.
6. Never once did I notice that my hair looked stronger/shinier/healthier/fuller. Quite the opposite. I thought it might have looked a little more voluminous for a day or two, but quickly realized that what I was seeing was damage. Then it became brittle and started breaking off all day long.

So, it took two weeks of daily use to completely destroy my hair (hey, I wanted to give it a fair shot). FYI, this model has a similar warranty to much cheaper drug store brands. Also, return shipping is fairly expensive even at the cheapest rate (I paid around $14). If you have thick, tough hair that needs some abuse to be tame then maybe this will be a good choice for you. But if your hair is fine, thin, or otherwise delicate and damage prone, steer clear.",0
"It is not work as well as I expected. Yes, it does soft but too soft to remove my make up. I requested the return service and it would take me 13 dollars! So I just decided to keep this product which is not useful...",0
"This is great soap with a great smell. It is very rich and lathers rather well. I do believe it is a little pricey for the amount you receive. But for the price, I would give it a 5 rating. I do recommend it and plan to purchase other soaps from Proraso.",1
"I used as directed for about a month, and kept getting breakouts (!).  Stopped using and they went away.  Something in this product irritated my skin.  It DID make my skin look cleaner and healthier, but the aforementioned flare-ups leave the product something to be desired.",0
I love it!,1
Sweet smooth stuff,1
easy to use.  I'm seeing longer lashes,1
"I found the texture of Obagi Professional C to be between a serum and a very lightweight cream. It went on smoothly and the coverage was just right with three pumps. It is almost scent free but there is a tiny whisper of a citrus scent. After it had absorbed into my skin, I felt a slight tingle, noting big but there was definitely a reaction. It left my skin feeling smooth without any tightness. I can't speak to long term use on wrinkle appearance, it's only been a week. The container is very small so be sure you take the size into account when purchasing.",1
"I ordered medium brown, I paid for rush delivery and I got the wrong product. I want this fixed.",0
"Gray color was too ""steely"" for my hair.  Had to purchase container of white to lighten which helps so color is acceptable, but still not an excellent match.
Wish they had a gray with blonde/tan overtones.",1
Smells bad and is messy. But I guess it's suppose to be...???. Not bad. Wont be buying again though.,0
"Wife's review- I have straight, short lashes, and none of the many mascaras I've ever used make them look long or full, including this one. However, it truly stays put all day long. It doesn't run, looks exactly the same when I take it off at night as it did when I first applied it in the morning. Extremely waterproof. Doesn't budge when I wash my face. I have to use makeup remover to get it off. I will probably buy it again when I run out.",1
Terrible stuff. Im in my forties and I swear when I applied this it sucked all the moisture out of my skin. Sunk into my lines and made me look all crepe-y. Awful. Dont by unless you're a dewy-skin teenager.,0
This does not fit my Clarisonic Professional.,0
Ordered a cream pink and received a bubblegum pink almost the same exact color I ordered previously. Was not happy at all.,0
GREAT for blonde/light color hair. Easy to use and can extend wash time for very oily hair to 2 days instead of every day.,1
"Not really. It only lasts 2 weeks, plus you can't get the rest of it that's in the bottle.",0
"I like the smell, pretty refreshing and cleans well. The price is a little steep, but worth it. I travel overseas and end up having to put it in smaller containers.",1
"Easy to apply gel color, two coats for even finish. I got a lot of compliments! Great summer color, looking forward to fall colors!",1
Excellent Seller! Super highly recommended!!!!!!,1
"Sticky Mess, not worth any penney.",0
Left my hair a little dry actually. Will not buy again,0
I am dissappointed. I did not receive any papers or warranty on this iron? All I got was the iron in a box. I need directions. Warranty. Receipt.  Tonya,0
"I have fine hair that is slightly wavy which is fairly easy to manage. You would think that it would be very easy to style but, it wasn't. The brush has no real gripping value at all which means my hair kept sliding out of the bristles. I had to force my hair through the bristles when on tv it looks like she is barely waving her wrist and the product evenly styles and never falls out. I had to go over the same area three to four times. I mainly bought it to add more body to my hair and maybe calm down the waves but, it really didn't do any different than a flat iron. Way over priced. This should cost about 40 bucks minimum. If you have a very short haircut this product might work but, probably not. Don't buy into the hype.",0
"As a young adult I have been looking for some sort of product to eliminate facial hairs and so far it's been a struggle and I still have hope I will find a product..waxing is not the best solution but for now it will do and I've tried many different kinds and so far I keep coming back to this one.
I recently tried GiGi and it just didn't work that well.

Bliss really does work because it cleanly pulls out all hairs when you apply it...others do not seem to stick to the skin well and leave a lot behind.  Like any wax it can be messy.. I also have somewhat sensitive skin and my face tends to look red/irritated right after waxing but that quickly fades away.
It is more highly priced that other waxes but I guess that is because it works.",1
"Color is nothing like on the pic. And i saw it in teh nail salon - looked like on the pic.

So, maybe product shipped is fake? not sure.",0
Great price and works great on my eye lashes.,1
"I got this gift set because I love this fragrance.  It is great for everyday wear.  Women always want to get close when they smell it and I get compliments on it often.  My gift set arrived on time and everything seemed fine.  I put the travel size spray bottle on my desk at work, just to refresh the fragrance around midday.  However, when I attempted to use it, the spray bottle didn't work.  So, I just contacted the seller, Beauty Encounter, to see if they can replace the travel size spray bottle.  I will see what happens and update my review at that time.  I gave it 4 stars due to the faulty spray bottle.  The fragrance itself deserves 5 stars.",1
"I don't know if I got an old one or what, but this perfume smells like spray starch. Or like a cross between spray starch and those old, unscented hairsprays (like ""Aqua Fresh""...do they even still sell those??).

Was totally bummed because everyone seemed so happy with this scent and I bought based on the reviews.

I ordered the ""L"" by Lolita at the same time and it smells great! Nothing at all like this other (and reviewers said they were close sisters), so maybe I did get a bad bottle.

Update: After 2 hours of smelling like spray starch, I scrubbed my skin with a hot washcloth. THEN it still smelled, but it smelled good! Musky/powdery/vanilla like people described. Still smelled strong, just no spray starch. And it smelled almost identical to the way the ""L by Lolita"" smells right out of the bottle.",0
Love the scent!,1
"Usually use MOMO conditioner by Davies which I absolutely cannot live without.  Thought this conditioner would work even better because I have curly hair.  That wasn't the case.
My hair felt so dry after using this.  Going to stick with MOMO.  My hair is the healthiest it's ever been since I started using it.  Wish I could say the same for the LOVE conditioner. Oh well...",0
Was very disappointed with this after hearing good things from beauty professionals. It does not hold nearly as strongly or for as long as the Anastasia Beverly Hills gel and it leaves an unpleasant white residue after just a couple hours of wearing it. Not worth it.,0
Too greasy. Made me real out at age 58. Love other products that are more affordable.,0
"I love Chi hairspray although I was surprised to find that when I received the bottle it did not work, but I played around with it a bit and did get it to work for about 2 days and then suddenly it stopped working again. I have tried many things to get this bottle operational and nothing works. Actually purchased two bottles and both did the exact same thing simultaneously! It is way too much hassle to even try and ship something like this back, I just wish they would take responsibility and send new bottles to the customer and with a return item box so that we can ship out the damaged product back to them.",0
"Love the product, this is my third Solano blow dryer. The plug did break but under warranty and was repaired quickly, I had to pay for shipping.",1
Overpriced. No difference from other shampoos that cost a lot less,0
"Me: Nearly 50 with dry, sensitive skin. Normally I hate scents in skincare. This smells a little like coconut so it's quite pleasant to smell. You need VERY little of this - otherwise it feels a little greasy upon application, but give it a few minutes and it completely soaks in. Make-up goes on smoothly over the top of this cream - and I don't need to use a separate primer beforehand. I haven't used it long enough to see any cumulative effects, but I'll update if I do. It's supposed to blur lines and wrinkles, but I don't see that yet, either.

The directions say to apply this over their truffle serum - I'm betting just about any serum would be OK. I use this over my Meaningful Beauty Creme de Serum as the Meaningful Beauty isn't moisturizing enough on its own.

Pros:  No parabens, and not tested on animals. Made in Italy.
Con: I wish it was in a pump bottle as I hate contaminating cream by dipping my fingers into it. Fortunately, I have a small spatula I kept from a different cream I used in the past.

NOTE: The Amazon title says 1 ounce, but the jar is actually 1.7 ounces.",1
Looks nice and shiny for about five days.  If your hands are in water you will not make it a week. Disappointed in this product.,0
"This is a very effective hand cream for men. I bought this for my husband, and he has been using it daily. With the first use, there was a noticeable improvement in his hands. He's not crazy about the smell--eucalyptus, I think. It's pretty subtle, though.",1
This has a gentle approach to cleaning and rejuvenating the skin.  I use it a couple times per week with good results.,1
I loved the color.  But this entire color line by Essie chips VERY FAST.  Even with a great top coat.  Fortunately it dries fast.  But I found myself having to redo my nails almost every day with all of the colors that I bought from this line.  Making me shy away from Essie for a while...,0
"This product is good but you have to use it before bed or when you are not going out because it makes your face very shiny. with constant use, you will definitely notice your skin is cleaner and healthier.",1
I've ordered this product now several times and am always pleased with the product.,1
I am very fair and even the lightest shade of this foundation is too dark. As with many foundations it seems to have too much yellow in the base. The coverage is not as I had hoped either. I have good skin but this did not even cover my freckles. I will not purchase this again.,0
It keeps my pores  look smaller,1
Love love this goes on nice adds a lot of moisture great for fine lines,0
Love all the PCA products I have purchased!  I can see a difference within a few weeks of starting to use it.  The prices seem to have gone up on some products since my last purchase.  A bit pricey.,1
"I had been using Nail Envy and a manicurist said that with my peeling nails I should try the Sensitivity and Peeling formulation.  Even with applying it once or even twice a day, it didn't hold my nails together like the regular Nail Envy did.  I feel I wasted my money.",0
"I bought this by mistake and didn't realize until after I opened it, but it's pretty good.  I'm not an aftershave person though.",1
"I am a HUGE fan of L'Occitane products.  They are pricy, but always worth the price and tend to last quite a while.  This oil most certainly fits in with the rest of the line's products, and I absolutely LOVE using it.  I feel sinfully spoiled every morning when I put it on; from the texture to the scent this is very much a luxury.

The texture is silky, and not oily at all.  A couple of drops glides on smoothly, and is not thick.  The scent is divine!  It is what I would imagine a heavenly creature would smell like, and does not leave my skin perfumed all day.

That being said, I can't give it 5 stars because I don't feel that it keeps my skin moisturized all day; I still have to put on some sort of additional moisturizer about 5 minutes after I put this on.  I'm considering getting the L'Occitane Imortelle Divine Lotion, 6.7 fl. oz. because I suspect it might be a better way to not only spoil myself, but also keep my skin hydrated all day.",1
"I recently went to Hawaii and bought two of these bottles since the sun is pretty intense out there. I don't know if the 1st bottle I used was a default because my whole back burned. I thought that it was odd that my back only burned but I think it was mainly due because this was the area that was exposed because I was facing away from the sun the entire time in the pool.  I initially thought maybe I missed this area when I sprayed (although my husband sprayed my back) so the next day I used another sunblock and used this spray on my shoulder to see if it was the reason. Sure enough my shoulder got burned. This was very disappointing to say the least since these are pretty expensive and not a lot of product in the can. I ended up not using the second bottle since I was afraid I might have the same thing happen.  In addition, the formula smelled very strongly of alcohol. I will not be purchasing this again.",0
"The photo of what I purchased was of Red Door Classic. It is a bottle with a red half moon top, a gold border below the red top with a clear bottle of et de toilette in the base. The photo to the right of this writing square IS NOT what I was shown when I made the purchase and not what I wanted but was what was mailed to my mom , as it was a gift. Unacceptable!!",0
I specially wanted OUD by Vince Camuto not this black fregrance,0
"Cute, smells and adds a nice sheen to the lips! I wear it when I'm going for a natural look",1
Curling iron is VERY heavy especially if you have very long hair.  It also doesn't heat up to the 430 degree setting it has.,0
"I mostly went by the reviews, and noticed some of them saying it was a light floral.  My wife typically picks that type of perfume so that was a lot of help.  She really like it, and I was impressed by the elegant vial it was in.  Thanks for all the reviews, that was a big help.",1
"this bronzer imparts a nice, natural glow.....not too orangey....a little sparkle, but not too much.....I'm a pale redhead and this gives me just enough color to knock off my natural fish-belly white glow in the dark complexion.....lol.....

I load a fluffy brush and after applying my mineral make-up. I touch this to my forehead, cheek bones, under my chin and a little on my neck......and wahhh laaaa.....I look healthy and vibrant again.......makeup is my friend.  :)",1
I didn't like this product at ALL.  It clumped when I put it on.  I will never buy it again.,0
"I got the color ""aubrey"" and I love it. It is a nice mauve color, darker than in the picture. The smell is very strong and reminds me of my other nail polishes. It has poor coverage, goes on streaky and dries too long. Actually, it does not dry at all. I paint one thin layer and wait for hours. Then it smudges.  I will update about how long it will last.
Update:  first chipping on day 3 but not on all nails, so it is better than my old revlon polish.
I guess it is an ok nail polish but I wish one coating was sufficient and the drying time was shorter.",0
Met expectations,1
"don't buy this product, it is a waste of money.",0
"Definitely covers rosacea redness well but the color match was off for me. Also, it wasn't a smooth finish. It brought out every skin imperfection I have. It would be great as a tattoo cover but not a great daily foundation for my rosacea skin.",0
Green Tea smell is so clean. I have used this scent for 10 years now and I love it. I just is he scent would last all day long....sometimes I need to apply again after lunch.,1
Excellent buy,1
"We love the other glytone products, but this one did not foam and left a film on the skin. Did not help with breakouts.",0
"Very clean modern minimalist design in the packaging. I gotta say though, this does not smell like the one that I purchased at Sephora. The one from Sephora has a distinct rose petal scent... This one is like water... This also does not clean my face as well as the one from Sephora.

Also my product was damaged upon arrival. To me the package is part of the experience and the whole top was missing off of mine.",0
This is a knock off. Do not buy!! I have worn this scent for 18 years. I can't even recognize what this smell is. It's awful. My husband loves Burberry on me. And as soon as I sprayed this he asked why I changed perfume. I am so disappointed. And to add insult to injury I missed the return window because I had waited to open the bottle until my last bottle was gone. Do not make the same mistake I did. Buy your Burberry somewhere else.,0
One of my favorite perfumes and the fact that it is unisex is awesome. I'm gifting this for my nephew.,1
"I'm really at a loss here. Its just not good. I wet it, and went to remove my makeup and hardly any makeup came off on the cloth. My eye makeup was still firmly in place and hardly smudged at all. I did use very light pressure on my eyes and firmer presser on the rest of my face, but even then, the amount of makeup on the cloth after ""removing"" my makeup was so minimal I was just frustrated. Ive tried again several other times with very similar results. I don't get the hype for this whatsoever.",0
Been using this for years...I have very thin hair and use these fibers....in the thin areas and it covers up very well!!!,1
"Obviously, most of us cannot jet off to Hawaii where awapuhi grows and was/is used by native Hawaiians to condition their gorgeous locks...so having a dose of anything ""from Hawaii"" or having an ""ancient secret formula"" with an exotic name like Awapuhi sounds so alluring. It would be an easy way to get a little bit of the bliss of the Islands in your shower if it worked. I wish I could say that this product leaves my hair feeling smooth and deeply conditioned. However, it does not. I recalled using it in the 90's and thought, ""Let me try Awapuhi again..."" I love the scent; I love the history and genius that is Paul Mitchell. The man has such a legacy. I so wanted to love this product like finding an old flame and instantly reconnecting. But the passion is not there. Has the formula changed? Of course, there is the warning on the label not to buy professional grade beauty products outside a salon...does this apply to Amazon? I wish I could go to Angus's (Paul's son's) beauty salon in Beverly Hills and ask him in person, but I am stuck on the East Coast for now. No, I will not be buying Awapuhi again--in or out of a salon. Instead, I am going to try Mitchell's son's new formulas and see if these products work better. Maybe they are formulated to work on modern tresses better? As I recall...when I was using (and liking this product) we were all about letting our hair dry ""naturally."" That was the look that was ""in."" Now, it's all about smoothed out hair. And, this product just does not cut the demanding ways of today's current hair stressors, blow outs, roller brushers, flat irons, oh my! This product is more for those who have ""off the grid"" hair styles. Like Paul Mitchell's famous farm in Hawaii. You mean you don't know about his off the grid farm where guests can unplug for $250 a night? I told you Paul Mitchell was ahead of his time!",0
"This stuff is great, no complaints. I use this with an NYC brow wax pencil and it stays on all day.",1
Great alternative to gel manicures.  Lasts longer then the regular nail polish!,1
"For years I've used L'Occitane products, ever since my sister brought me some from Paris. Normally I'd give their products a high rating, however, the shea butter in this tin was gritty under the top layer. It feels like rubbing sand on my skin and the 'grit' does not melt. It stays gritty. I will not purchase another tin and take a chance. This tin was a pricey waste of money.",0
I agree with the other reviewer who said most of these reivews must be fake. They must have gotten all their employees and their family and friends and so on to come online to write great reviews. All this product does is make your forehead look like someone rubbed black coal dust all over it.,0
"I bought it about 2 month ago and just opened it about one week ago. I loved the smell at first. It is similar to black one, which is for men. But interesting thing about this item is the smell has been changed suddenly (like an expired perfume). At first I thought maybe I get used to it, but when my husband and my close friend said the same thing I just realized that I am right. I am sad because the smell used to be irresistible.",0
"Clarity Serum is not aggravating to my skin, yet cleared up current blemishes and helped keep future blemishes from forming.",1
It does not work.,0
"I always try out products before I let the pre-teenagers any where near them.  I was glad it was me instead of one of the children when my face turned RED.  What was THAT about?  So red, but it didn't hurt.  I would also say that y skin feels smoother after using it.  However, my skin tone is already great to start with.  I am very lucky.  (The key for me is to never wear makeup other than a little mascara and lipstick.)  (Just try telling a 15 year old goth that.)

Our pre teen was prepared to see his skin turn red.  He said it was more like a 'light' red.

Use a very small amount.  It goes a long way.",1
"1/3 had spilled out in the box.
Ive used it for 3 times no reactions. Feels good on the face.
I have oily skin. I normally use tarte rainforest mist. Clean skin, pat dry and use it before foundation.",1
The color is a little odd but it blends in beautifully and smells amazing! The color is instant on my fair skin. Love this product!,1
I ve used this product for more than a year and is yet to see some sort of result this product is truly misleading and the price is not worth it. I'm still suffering with my issue,0
"I switched from Bare escentuals to this a few months back.  I had been a  loyal Bare escentuals customer for over 5 years but when I heard that they had changed how it was made and it could be doing damage to my skin I decided to find something new.  I have been using Dermablend Intense Powder Camo Foundation for 3 months now.  It provides a matte coverage that last through the entire work day and then some (approx. 10 hours) if you're not sweating. The only thing is I should have bought a shade darker.  I bought natural because that is usually the shade I purchase for me but I will try one shade darker for my next purchase.  Also, the seller had it delivered to me quickly and it was packed safely and neatly.",1
Great tan - not orange at all.,1
"After reading the reviews i looked forward to trying this lip butter.  I have to say I was surprised at how little you got for twelve dollars.
The quality was nothing special. I will get something else next time.",0
"I am not sure if I got an old item or if this is the real deal but when I opened this, the brush was stiffed and it was hard to work on the color. I have bought several CND Shellac from other sellers before and none of it was like this. I should have checked the item as soon as I received ot bit being inside the box, i thought there was not going to be a problem. I am planning to contact seller if this is still eligible for exchange.",0
works well and feels fine on. This top coat covers polish well and leaves a nice sheen on my nails,1
Love it!,1
"No, nothing good to say and a waste of money.  When it claims to help oily skin, and does nothing of the kind-that is false advertising.
I would like a total refund.",0
It was very dry and hard to apply. I let too much time go by to send it back.,0
"I usually purchase the tube shaving cream of this, but decided to purchase the soap instead. This smell great and there is a lot of it in the jar it comes with. Easy removable lid. I look forward to trying this stuff out. If I don't like it, I will change my reveiw.",1
It's the perfect office-who's that girl-sophisticated woman-modern woman-working class color and it doesn't chip for weeks! What's not to like?!,1
"Personally, I do not like getting tanned at all.

I do not sunbathe and wear sunscreen to eliminate as much suntan as possible.

For person like myself, I thought this sunscreen was little too weak in protecting me from the sun.

This sunscreen seems to be for those who wants to get a suntan while eliminating sunburn while sunbathing.

This sunscreen glides well and it is water resistant. So it is perfect for beach sunbathing.",1
Maybe I don't know how to use it. But is the second time I buy it and I love the color but for some reason seems to be empty as it work a few times and that's it.,0
Works great!,1
"I have it for over 2 years now. Mainly needed it for face and underarms. I used to get professional laser treatments once in 2-3 month, but that was very time consuming and inconvenient. Tried Tria laser for a year, it did not work, so I bought this one and was hoping it will.
However, not much changed over 2 years. My hair is dark/gray. Skin is white. I use this device 3 times a week or so. Tried it on bikini area, and that seemed to reduce hair somewhat...but face and underarms are the same, if not worse than after I stopped the professional laser treatments.
Also, Iluminage support is in foreign country (not sure if it was France or other) but reps had difficulties speaking and explaining how it works. I plucked the hair out and then applied this tool several times on the same spot, just in case. The other option was to shave the hair, but then they could not explain to me what will happen after, is the hair supposed to fall out? Still unsure what to do about it, but I am not happy with this tool.",0
"I purchased this accidentally when I was trying to order Re:coil.  I won't make that mistake again.  The Re:coil product works perfectly for my thick, curly hair and this just doesn't.

For an excellent review that mirrors my own experience, please reference the one written by Amechania.  She states very succinctly what I would have said.",0
"In love with these opi nailpaints.... dries so fast, texture is velvety.... im gonna purchase more.... in love barefoot in Barcelona color and red my fortune",1
I had high hopes for this. This does not help my nails dry at all. At least not that I can tell.,0
Nice product. A little on the thick side but not surprising for sunscreen,1
"Used it before, couldn't get it from my hair salon. So I tried new product, liked this Surface product the best.",1
"Gorgeous, classic ruby color. Perfect for fall and winter.",1
This stuff smells soooooo good but I only got to use it once because I dropped it and it literally shattered. Buyers beware not to drop it or else your money will shatter along with it :(,0
"This lotion has a pleasant scent, but the bottle had an orange mark on it. I kept this one for myself and ordered another as a gift, as
I felt the packaging looked tacky to give someone. I would recommend this lotion to others who enjoy this lemon verbena scent.",1
"The color wasn't accurate at all, and it doesn't blend at all. Even when it was completely dried and layered on thick, the second it touched my clothing it faded off. I think this would work well for slight discoloration, but not at all for the tattoo cover-up I was looking for",0
This is very overrated and highly over priced. It claimed that it would make unhealthy hair vibrant and healthy--NOT! Very difficult to use. Shampoo is thick and does not mix well with water. Leaves glops of shampoo stuck to the palm of hand or in hair. Does not work easily into hair nor does it rinse out easily. Don't waste your money on this. There are many other good to great shampoos available at a fraction of the cost that are better for your hair.,0
"It really didn't make a difference.  I think i will have to visit a dermatologist after all, I was trying to avoid that cost.  It seems like these over the counter brightening creams are good only for maintenance but not to actually get rid of my very dark sun spots.  Disappointed.",0
Received this product yesterday and used it for the first time this morning.  I will not be using it again.  It is a waste of money.  The motor kept going in and out while drying my hair.  When it worked it did a great job; but I am very concerned about it shorting out while using.,0
So far haven't seen too much results still giving it time. I like the way it feels and smells. It's ok,1
The item pictured is not what I received ... instead it was a black bottle of oil.,0
"Do not buy this!  I purchased it about a year ago and it has broken several times. I have been able to rig it to be functional twice and now the parts have started breaking off. The diffuser has several small pieces on the inside that are held by a ""rubber band"". This is how it can be fit into the end of the blow dryer and stay in place. But the rubberband comes out from behind the small pieces and does not allow me to slide the diffuser all the way onto the hair dryer. I have a babybliss hairdryer as well, so it should not be caused by a poor fit. I have been able to slip the rubber band back behind the parts, but it's started falling apart. It wasn't terribly expensive, thankfully, but I would advise you to look elsewhere if you want something that you can use more than 3 times.",0
"This blush glides on pretty smoothly. The pigmentation provides a nice peach color for my cheeks. I thought that this blush blended really well too. I thought this blush was long lasting in wear. I would definitely recommend this if you wear blush, the color is subtle and not at all overwhelming or garish.",1
Love this cream. It has a great slip and seems to help with dry skin,1
Perfect volume. Great product,1
"This item is NOT universal! It does NOT work with my Bio Ionic blow dryer. It fits but then it just slides off every time. Should have returned it, but waited too long, oh well. Don't recommend! Bummer!",0
"I was disappointed,  because I was sent a different product: EltaMD  un tinted version of product by error...decided to keep and use.  It burns under the eyes, but does protect,  is pasty white even though it says clear.",0
wuldnt reccomend. at first i was so excited for so much drugz for such a low cost. but when i tried to snort it it burned a lot. didn't feel good after. plz help. what did i do wrong?????????,0
I like this spray.  It feels refreshing on my face.  It helps eliminate powderiness when I've overdone it with the makeup.  I dislike that there is added fragrance.  Without the added fragrance this would have five stars.,1
The color that arrived looked nothing like the picture and it doesn't cover very well.,0
"Used the PMD frequently and never saw any results whatsoever. Other than slightly roughing up your skin, I don't see what this product is good for. Probably not really any different to regularly using a cleanser with scrubbing beads.",0
"Smells good but didn't do much for my thick, unruly hair.",0
I have oily skin and this didn't help at all.,0
It does not whiten teeth as described on a TV Infomercial.  I will never purchase it again!!,0
"Great product, works",1
Much better products on the market. This is also kinda dry?,0
Great product,1
I love this hairspray - was introduced to it by my stylist.  It is not sticky and it does not build up.  Hair is touchable and does not feel tacky at all,1
"It worked well, but it was WAY too expensive for what I got. I regret this purchase.",0
My dermatologist continues to use this on her skin...I love it!,1
"I returned this product.  Was way too hot for my hair.  Plus, there is no way to control the heat.",0
"I had high hopes for this product, but it burns the skin around my eyes, so it is not for me. I need a product for sensitive skins.",0
I like the way the product worked but the perfume that is added was overpowering and gave me a headache. I'm sensitive to strong scents so if you aren't it would probably a fine product. I do like their shampoos a lot.,0
"I had high hopes for this nail polish due to it's claims to last a week and relatively good reviews.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  I got the nail polish in the color ""Negligee"" (light pink) and the application was not very even.  I applied two coats, and it was ok, but not great (I have a lot of nail polish from various salon brands, and I was not impressed with this).  I didn't think that it tried any faster than any of the other nail polish that I own, and it was chipping within a couple of days.  I'm not sure if buying the top coat from this same CND brand would help (I typically use Seche Vite), but I won't be purchasing anymore polish from this brand since one was such a let down.",0
"nice to keep around the office or end table to always apply especially after washing or handling a lot of papers (if you were ever wondering why our hands get rough with paper products it is because it contains pumice  so pencils,pens and markers will write)but it is not one to heal skin just keeps them soft and pretty",1
"I've only been using this for a week and can already tell a difference in my skin's tone and texture.  My skin looks brighter and more hydrated.  I'm not a huge fan of the smell, but would rather have a natural product like this than a bunch of irritating fragrances.  I'm not sure if it's worth $95, but I'm a fan of the product.",1
"Hey Jennifer. Love this product. So hydrating and cooling. Worth every penny. Below is a breakdown of the contents of this product to make this easy for you Amy.
""Ingredients-Pure, Natural evian Mineral Water: Propelled by safe nitrogen (the air we breathe is 80 percent nitrogen) with a neutral 7.2 pH.""
TRANSLATION:
""Ingredient-Only Water.  That's right Nancy, Water is naturally occurring. So organic. Wow.  Bet this water is even gluten free too!  Gathered from the process used to gather water.  Fun fact: the air on earth mostly consists of Nitrogen.  Samantha, they even use ""safe"" nitrogen, as is used for any propellant spray.  GENIUS!  Opposed to using DANGEROUS/UNSAFE nitrogen; just kidding Nitrogen is Nitrogen Janet! Oh, and like ALL water, THIS Water has a neutral pH level.  That's right Nancy, this is some grade ! VEGAN WATER.""

This water is GMO free.  Dairy free too Cassie.  Vegetarian AND Vegan.  Hypo-allergenic af Jackie.  Free of pesticides.  And made with pure H20.  Assembly is very simple and easy to follow, even you can do it Meg.  MUCH more satisfying than spraying water on your face from a different bottle. YAS BIATCH.",0
This is the only product that works.  I have thin nails.  This product protects and hardens.  I am able to have decent nails only with NAIL ENVY. Thanks OPI,1
Not good.,0
I have bought this eyeliner twice now because it is easy to apply and it stays on all day! I would definitely recommend it to others.,1
"Could not hate this more. My face was freshly cleansed and I sprayed this on. Within five minutes, my face felt filthy. Have tried a couple of times and just ick",0
"Best conditioner Ive ever found for my easily tangled hair. I first tried it when a hotel provided it, and I immediately ordered it.",1
Have used it for years.,1
Product took a lot longer to deliver than promised but the worst part was that about 1/3 of the product had leaked out of the top cap and saturated the cardboard box.  The cap was loose so I guess that's what happened.  Better packaging is needed by this vendor.  I thought about sending it back but didn't want to hastle with getting it repackaged and I needed (wanted) what was left in the bottle.,0
Oribe has nothing but quality products!  It's a little pricey but has done wonders for my hair! Love it!,1
"The colors are not very saturated and wear off very quickly.  Worst of all, it all accumulates in my crease within just a few hours.  It's a shame because the product is very soft and feel very natural, just doesn't last.  I have had luck with the Selfie palette from Pur, but not this one for some reason.  Looks like it's going in the trash.",0
"Well, it does not do much on my hair. Not worth the price at all",0
Doesn't do much for me during the day.  Wouldn't buy again.,0
"I have very thick but fine hair. Sounds like an oxymoron, but what I mean is that my hair strands themselves are very fine, but I have a lot of them. My hair is wavy/slightly curly and tends to frizz like madness each time I brush it. Every time I flat iron my hair, I have to be very careful because my hair tends to be dry and I have an ombre style color (brown on top, blonde on the bottom). My brown hair is more heat resistant while my blonde tends to fry in the flat iron. I've used many different heat protectants and I had high expectations with this one because of its' label and reviews. I am a licensed cosmetologist so my expectations for a product label are usually warranted. It gets two stars because it definitely protected my ends from frying in the iron like they normally do...however, this product is way too thick and greasy. Very heavy. After styling and using this product with my flat iron, I have noticed my hair becomes stiff and oily- not the typical carefree, soft, hair that blows freely in the wind. If the wind blew at my hair, it probably wouldn't move. And that cute hair flick we ladies like to do when we run our hands through our hair? Forget it. Not happening. If you do happen to get your fingers through your hair, you'll need to wash them afterwards as the sticky residue this product leaves on your hands is gross.

My suggestion: If you can find another product that is a great heat protectant for your hair, do so. If you have hair like mine that fries easily even with the best heat protectants, then use this serum but ONLY in very small quantities and ONLY on your ends. Also, it'd probably suit a curly hair style better with a curling iron...not so much with the flat iron unless you want straight stiff-as-a-greasy-board hair.",0
Won't recommend this to friends. The spray hurts my scalp somehow. It gave this burning feeling. Don't like the product. Didn't know the product doesn't allow to be returned. Wasted the money.,0
I am soooo happy that I had this product. It is easy to use and carry. I am happy because I have to spend less time woring a bout my hair.,1
Love this stuff. It is great for my skin at night and not oily like others. Love the dispenser which gives you the same amount each time used,1
"I had used a friend's BaByliss hairdryer while staying at her house, and it was awesome!  It made my hair look the best it had ever looked, dried it so quickly, and it was so stinkin' shiny!  Of course, I immediately came home and went on amazon and found this hairdryer.  I saw the price and was so excited!  So I bought it.

I'm not sure if it's not the correct hairdryer, is a different model or a different year, but the other dryer was way better.  Don't get me wrong, this is a very nice product.  But it's pretty heavy, not quite as powerful, and is just overall more like a drugstore hairdryer rather than a salon one.  It does the job, but is definitely not the best hairdryer I've ever used.",1
"Great product, smells great (lemon) and it's a great moisturizer for dry cracked lips, but a bit pricey - $10 for a small tube.",1
"THIS REVIEW IS FOR PACKAGING ONLY.

I love waxing at bliss and I love this accompanying product that they developed to prevent ingrowns. I use them religiously. So the last time I was at bliss, I didn't realize I was running low on these pads. When I got home, I was too lazy to go back to the spa so I decided to order them from Amazon. When they arrived, the jar was in a box. HOWEVER, I soon found the jar to be completely wet. Not sure what happened but when I twisted off the top of the jar, it was not sealed and thus liquid had been leaking everywhere. It LOOKS as though the jar is mostly full of pads but now I'm suspicious that someone was tampering with my jar. Should have just bought them in the spa.",0
weighs hair down,0
"horrible product, horrible customer service. What more need to be said?",0
Husband had been wanting this cologne for a while. Amazon had the best price by far. It smells great on him!,1
"Disappointed. The blush arrived broken into crumbled pieces in the compact. Blush was all over exterior packaging. Color is nice, but nothing special.",0
This product just doesn't get my hair clean. Saw absolutely no change in tone or brightness after several uses.,0
"I ordered this product in the lightest color available, which I had to view on another site just to figure out because it is not clear from this site, and it is extremely obvious when I put this on that I am wearing a lot of make up and that it is too dark for my pale skin. Not only that, but on the first shipment, it was damaged so I had to be sent a replacement and I wanna return that one already. It's way too thick and super obvious on my pale skin, and I had ordered alabastro. I am disappointed that I wasted forty dollars on this.",0
Makes my hair feel sticky!,0
"Didn't do much for the blonde, hair still showed bronze over time",0
"I liked this lotion, but the scent is not like smelling either violets or orchids.  A bit heavy for me.  Use sparingly for you will smell like those little old ladies at church whose olfactory glands (nose) have ceased working!  The color definitely appeals to kids!",1
"Came Quickly ! I love this dryer but I gave it a 4 star only because the switches are in a bad play for my small hands . I have to choke the handles of dryers and with this dryer I tend to shut it off or change the heat setting ...It will take some time getting use too but I love it and it's suppose to be better for your hair because of the Ionic negative heat . I also bought the Ionic around brush and love it also but got that at Sally's beauty supplies . I hope to some day get the Babyliss flat iron as well . Very good product , and cheaper then at the supply house",1
DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! It is a fake. I got it and it felt like glue and destroyed my hair and expensive hair extensions. Buy from salon only,0
This product works only if you're consistent with it. Do it as instructed and you will see the results. Recommend!,1
"Yes, the older I get the drier my hair gets making it hard to manage not to mention looking good. I often wash my hair before I go to bed, in the morning its frizzy and all over the place. WOW goes best on dry hair, you only need a small dab, work it in and arrange your hair as you like it. Using a hair drier and a brush( I find my boar bristle hair brush works best) style your hair as you wish and if you have the same results you'll have shinny hair thats come alive, its NOT greasy or oily just smooth shinny hair that looks like you spent a lot more time getting it to look so good. I understand its safe for dyed hair too so if you don't have lots of time and want your hair looking fresh and smooth this might be worth a try.",1
LOVE IT LOVE IT,1
"I was very excited, and so happy, but its terrible clipper! I used only 2-3  minutes later so hot and my customer said your clipper it burning me, and pulling hair too. I touched it, its very HOT. Dont buy it,  wasting  money. I put in the draw never touched it.  :(  not even worth 1 star  it should be 0 star ",0
"I was so disappointed with this product.  From the moment I first tried it, the mascara was excessively goopy and went on with globs in one spot, and too much soft mascara near the end of the tube, so it was difficult to get the goop off the brush.  I wouldn't waste my $.",0
does not smear correctly,0
"I hate this ""cleanser!""  I've used Meaningful Beauty products in the past and loved them, so I decided to give this a try.  First of all, it doesn't even feel like a cleanser.  It's like a liquid moisturizer.  When you apply it to your skin, it feels like it leaves a residue.  I guess that must be the moisturizing agent contained in the product.  I have dry skin so I thought it would be beneficial for my skin but, after a few days of use, it left my face with little bumps.  I've stopped using it as a result of this allergic reaction. I like a cleanser that actually feels like it's cleansing my skin.  I won't bother sending this back because it's too much trouble so I guess I'm out the $30.  I'll see if I can pass this along to a friend so it's not a total waste.  Maybe it will work for them.  My advice is, if you have sensitive skin, don't waste your money on this product.",0
Ahava is produced in the Israeli militarily occupied West Bank. Israel stole this land from Palestinians and continues to violate international law by moving its citizens onto this land and displacing Palestinian civilians in the process. If you support justice and human rights do not buy Ahava products!,0
One of the best investments we've made.  Helps clean the diaper area well.,1
Perfect curling iron!! And perfect for my budget!,1
it does not heat any more and i have only had it for 8 mons,0
Came opened. No wrap no cellophane immediately suspected used or fake. Smells like ladies deodorant. 0 starts if I could would not buy again. Smells so bad I feel like I need to wash it off.,0
Perfect and on time.,1
"This stuff works pretty well. I have thin, fine hair with a bit of a wave. Soft Sculpting Spray Gel is nice and lightweight, so it does not weigh my hair down. I feel like it protects my hair at least a little bit.",1
Very good product for your child. TearFree so you Can use on skin and hair without worry. Don't need too much to get a good base of lather on child. Smells great. Cleans very well. Each tube lasted one month for two toddlers. A bit expensive but worth it!,1
This has no oil or anything. Feels like water over your face and does not sting your eyes. Completely removes my makeup. The only bad thing is that since it has an opening I put too much and I will probably go through it pretty fast.,1
i've used it for some time now. It has done its job very quickly in fact. Should have discovered this in my teens.,1
"This is the only brand of cleansing water I've used. Therefore, I don't know if it's worth the price. It seems to do a good job getting foundation off. You have to soak cotton pads and then let them sit on your eyes for a minute for the cleansing water to remove eye makeup.",1
I honestly have not seen a difference in the color of my teeth after using this system. I am not a coffee drinker either. I will likely try a drugstore brand next time for whitening.,0
"This product caused a chemical burn on my face. If the system allowed a person to review with 0 stars, I would have.",0
"i bought these to give out to all the ladies in my office, who dosent like saving 70 dollars on lip gloss.",1
Muy bien,1
I do not like this product. It stays white on my skin and rubs off on my clothes.  It also runs into my eyes if I am sweating. Definitely not worth the high price.,0
"I really like this palette. It has great color selections for everyday use I purchased it for traveling purposes. It has everything you need in a good palette; highlighter, blush, bronzer/contour as well has some neutral toned eye shadows. Such a great deal for a Lorac palette.",1
"I prefer the soap version, face lathered, but if you like shave cream, no real faults.  Nice sandalwood scent",1
I like that it smells real nice.  But I'm not sure I like how it feels after it dries on my skin.,0
"It's good to clean the face. I feel my face is refreshed after washing my face with it. However, you need to follow up with toner and moisturizer immediately, or you'll feel your face is dry. I have combination skin, so it's good for my T-zone, but my cheek is dried out over the last 2 weeks since I started to use it. Maybe I should use a stronger moisturizer. I wouldn't use it everyday due to its exfoliation function. I would use it once every 2-3 days.",1
They smelled pleasant but I don't think they were authentic. The bottles looked like they have been tampered with and I didn't want to take the risk of using them on my skin,0
"I'm not sold on powder mineral sunscreen.  While I like the idea of it (something matte, not full of chemicals, no greasy lotion) it certainly didn't protect my face while out at my daughter's soccer game.  Never came home sun-burnt using my old liquid sunscreen but it was obvious I'd had too much sun after I'd switched to this and her game was only an hour.  For the amount I paid, I expected it to work at least as well as my liquid sunscreen.",0
"Used this twice a day despite a pretty weird and funky smell, but saw no improvement whatsoever by the time the bottle was gone.  It was nice and thick and felt like it moisturized, but due to the smell and lack of results I can't recommend.",0
"This design is different and NOT convenient for keeping 'in' the cut position, plus sliding the clipper under the nail. also, the clippers are ultra polished and I find it difficult to have a good grip while clipping nails",0
like it,1
Amazing color! Only thing is there's very little of it. But it's a great quality & color!!!! I highly recommend this product,1
"This item was not the same quality as when purchased from Sephora.
Very disappointed.",0
"I have a huge problem with my eye shadow and powder creasing. I set under my eyes and t zone with this powder and it works amazing....no oil all day. I am very impressed and new to setting or finishing powders. Also has a very nice cool feeling. Don't care for the puff, leaves fuzzies on my eyelashes.",1
"I used Sebastian Shaper light spray for years, then they discontinued it.  I tried this one thinking it would be comparable as it was the same brand.  It is not!  It is fine and goes on with a very light spray but the hair looks greasy and weighted down within hours of using, especially if I brush it. It looks like teenage greasy hair would look when you were young and needed to wash your hair. I am 60yrs old will be finding something else.  This stuff is awful.",0
"As a devoted user of the Pevonia Clarigel Cleanser, I thought the problematic cream would be a good combination.  I had tried the SpaTeen line moisturizer, but as a 30-year old with acne, found the teen line too drying.  The Problematic cream started off well, but I really wasn't a fan of the slightly gritty texture or the smell that was too close to a household cleaner odor.  I kept using it for about two months, hoping it would help the acne, but I saw little to no improvement and it actually made my dry patches worse.  I finally switched to Pevonia's combination skin cream which has a better smell and no funny texture, so though it didn't help my acne, I at least got rid of the bad side effects.",0
My daughter was losing her hair due to stress we bought this hoping it would help.  She developed HORRIBLE sensitivity and worse dandruff due to it.  They REFUSED to refund me the money I spent as we had used it.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!  If you use any product and you develop an issue you can return it (makeup etc) wether or not you have used it.  HORRIBLE customer service,0
"Such garbage! Waste of. Money. I don't think this is original opi as it chips after half a day!
My other infinite shines that I purchased at ulta last a good 5 days",0
"Covers well, I find it to look a little dry when first applied but looks very natural once it sets. I have oily skin so sometimes I feel as though it is sliding off. The upside is- unlike liquid foundation, you don't leave many makeup fingerprints around on things. Overall, I would purchase again. Covers blemishes well but not 100%. I use a beauty blender to apply.",1
"Leaves my teeth white, foams nicely. Not a fan of this particular flavor but the given quality of the paste I'll try other flavors. Not sure if it's any better than regular cheapo toothpaste but it looks nice on my bathroom counter.",1
Only complaint is that the tin was damaged upon arrival.,1
"The colors of these lip glosses are nowhere close to what's pictured either here on Amazon or The Balm's website. I bought three of these glosses and not one is the color I expected. However, they are not heavy or too sticky, and the smell is pleasant without being overwhelming. Kind of a mild vanilla. Just don't expect to receive the color you thought you were ordering!!",0
This is great stuff.  Just a little dab will do you.  leaves you hair very silky.  I would highly recommend this product!,1
Very pleased with this product.,1
"I bought this serum initially from my dermatologist office, and noticed results. I even had other people tell me they noticed my skin was so much better. However, I thought I would get a deal and buy this from Amazon and this bottle doesn't seem to be doing the job that the bottle I bought from the doctor did. It also seems more water down and thinner.",0
Love the color and the blue sparkles in it make it unusual... be prepared to use it as a layering polish though... you can make it opaque with 4 or more layers... layering it over a pink of the same hue will cause the same out come.,1
DID NOT CURL MY HAIR AT ALL!,0
"I use it on dry hair to smooth the frizzies
great smell too!",1
I ordered 2 #4 and only got one #4 and one #3.,0
"Was hoping to replace an amazing product by bare minerals that they no longer make, unfortunately this did absolutely nothing.",0
A nice light feeling facial sunscreen recommended by an anesthetition during a facial.  Have used it for quite some time and really like it.,1
It consistently took so much pressure in order to apply the eyeliner that the delicate applicator tip was quickly ruined.  I only got a couple of uses out of this before I had to throw it out.  :-(,0
I expect a night cream to be more enriching than this product is.  I am disappointed as I like the other products in this line.,0
Excellent product.  Doesn't clog pores and keeps shine at bay for a few hours.  Very light moisturizer for oily skin.,1
Hot Tools is awesome.  I love the extra long heavy duty cord.  I will be replacing all of my hair curling products with Hot Tools.,1
"The color is natural and beautiful, but the applicator brush is less than ideal. One click never produces any liquid, two clicks sometimes does and sometimes doesn't, and three clicks is suddenly way too much liquid. In addition, it doesn't stay on long. I had to reapply every 3 hours, which sounds like long time, but I'm not a reapplies-her-makeup-several-times-a-day kind of girl. I have $8 lip stain from Krogers that I like better than this. If it was $10 I'd buy it again, but not otherwise.",0
"This is the only product from the Avene line that I do not really care for. It is a bit greasy for my skin and I
just don't care for my appearance after using it. I think Avene has the capability of doing better.",0
"My hair holds curls pretty well. However, this does not keep my hair curly at all. I have to end up using a ton of hairspray which I had never had to before...",0
Light weight and works great. I'm happy with this purchase,1
Love the color,1
"Color not quite as shown.  Applies streaky, disappointing.",0
"Had to return. I am not convinced this was the same product as that I had purchased at a local salon. Packaging differed, scent differed, feel differed. Returned.",0
So far so good!,1
I didn't care for toppik because when putting on the product it flies all over.  I use Rock On Volumizing Powder and it works perfectly for giving fullness to your hair.  I have salt and pepper hair and giving it fullness is perfect.  I then use the Joan Rivers product to hide any scalp that may be showing thru.,0
"Um, not an INKLING of color distributed from these. I have to do use them each day to get THE SLIGHTEST ""tan"".. Save your money!!",0
"I have sensitive skin and have searched for a face sunscreen for a few years that doesn't cause irritation (in fact, I previously tried a different COOLA face sunscreen that didn't work for me).  This product worked great.  It didn't irritate my skin or cause breakouts.  Instead of applying it after moisturizer, I sometimes use it as my moisturizer if I'm going to be out in the sun.",1
"Meh... my expectations were higher for this company.  Clumpy, very difficult to wash off and dried quickly in the tube.  Pass",0
"I don't like to give a bad review. However, I depend on reviews when I purchase online. This is one of the worst mascaras Ive used. It causes my eyelashes to stick together and has so many clumps. It takes way too long to fix my lashes after putting this mascara on. Definitely not worth the money.",0
"if you love peppermint then it should be fine, otherwise it'll be too spicy for your legs! had to return mine.",0
The best foundation I've tried,1
"hated this stuff, gets all over your hands and is difficult to aim.
Dont' waste your money!",0
This is a nice neutral tone that isn't blaringly obvious if it chips. With the top coat this lasted me 5 days. I feel like one thing that does help is keeping nails trimmed. If they are too long and bend the polish cracks. I'm happy with this line and now have 3 colors.,1
Love it! Quite happy with the results! My hair is about to the bottom of my back and these give me the best loose but great quality curl!,1
I purchased this gave cream from Costco for the first time thinking I'd try something new. But I can't continue using it because the smell of the cream smells like VIM cleaning lotion.... Such a strong smell....I don't know how ppl stand it. Its like I'm putting cleaning agent on my face...,0
The worst. And yet one of the most expensive I've bought. My $8 mascara works so much better. I have to put 20 layers on for it to even look like I have mascara on.,0
Not super dark black but really easy to use.,1
GOOD,1
"The first time worked fine, lasted a couple of months. But later one, it damaged my hair...",0
"I purchased this one inch straightener for my 14 year old daughter; she loves it. I wouldn't recommend it for long, thick hair. It wouldn't be impossible, but it may be a bit impractical. Although, I think there's an exception for traveling. This compact iron is lightweight (just over a pound). The titanium plates heat up quickly and remains hot. It's comfortable to hold and thoughtfully designed. It's a little champion.",1
This bath wash with the matching lotion smells like true roses.!!!  The best I've been able to find anywhere and it stays!!,1
"I have to do a little mixing with a darker color to get the right match for my island tan color, but I'm happy with the product. I've been using it for yrs.

MW",1
"my tube only had enough for 3 applications, and you could see it clumped in the bottom. When it came out, it was clear, but the clumps in the bottle were yellow. This was just a sample size, so I wasn't that upset about it, but if I had bought the full size at regular price, I would have been mad about that. I don't think the amount I was able to use in the sample gave me any idea of how good or bad the full size product would be though.",0
"Bad product didn't do anything for me except for help lose more hair. At first it seems like it stopped the hair loss then shedding starts and never stops. I used it for 14 months with no results. Waist of a lot of money, if that's what your looking for then this will do the job.",0
"Holding a button for cool air!!?? Never had to do that before with my old hairdryers. If I knew before, would not have bought. Otherwise it functions as it should.",0
"This paste gets stuck and dry through the opening and you have to wash it out with hot water to prevent the clog.  The paste makes your hair dry and crackly feeling.  It has a good hold and small shine, but I think you can get that from any regular paste you would get at a local grocery store.  I say pass on this product.",0
This doesn't work at all.,0
Lame.  False advertisement. I saw three different items in the picture when I ordered it & the tittle says trio. The images were later altered to show the sides of the same box. All you get is one,0
"Similar to other reviewers, I received a bottle that had been tampered with by the seller. The safety seal had been removed and reattached. The cap was lose and whatever green stuff was leaking out was assuredly not the original product.",0
"I recently purchased La Roche-Posay Toleraine Ultra Moisturizer, largely because of the wonderful reviews I read on Amazon. It arrived today, the packaging was problematic. The box that it comes in was torn.

That being said, I applied the moisturizer in the morning and discovered that about 30 minutes after application the moisturizer had started to form sticky little white balls all over my face! At first, I thought my skin had had some kind of reaction to the moisturizer and was flaking. But upon further inspection, I realized that the little balls were gooey clumps of the moisturizer.

Has this happened to anyone else? Am I not applying it right? What can I do? I really wanted to like this moisturizer...",0
purchasing again - got the real thing and it works,1
It was ok not that good as I thought,0
The button of the voltage dose not function! I can't use in oversees!!!,0
Disappointed by the product,0
"This is the best dry shampoo ever! It doesn't weigh my hair down, smells amazing, and WORKS! I will buy this again and again. 5 stars!!",1
"I initially WON a complete pack of Nano Works Gold from Pureology on Istagram and immediately loooooved this new formula! I usually use the Strength (blue) shampoo and Hydrate (purple) conditioner but this has replaced the Strength! This is perfect for fine, blonde hair because it helps you keep your color, adds shine, and still protects under heat (especially if you have the purple color fanatic spray). And like all the other Pureology products, it smells AMAZING!!",1
"These are completely worthless because they don't twist for more liner. And now that I see another buyer had the same issue, I think it's safe to say the seller sold us crappy product and knew it. Thanks for  nothing.",0
One of the 2 containers was empty.  No serum at all.,0
"Omg! I am in love with this products...! Best I ever tried! When I post pic in my Facebook before/after the second week my friends could not believe .... Serum is wow, the wrinkle ampules are wow too,
The neck cream .... I have to have it!",1
Not nearly the shave I expected. Very disappointed.,0
"Usually the ingredients are listed according to the concentration present starting with the highest concentration. Masque claimed to be Argan Oil treat has this oil listed at the very last position among ingredients. Masque has very thick consistence which is hard to distribute evenly through the hair. Smell is pretty nice. To rinse the masque completely is  impossible. IMHO, this product is waste of money.",0
"Bought the NuBrilliance system and used it religiously, but never saw any difference in my skin.  Did find the creams were a good moisturizer.",1
Elastic stretches out too quickly.  Quality not there unfortunately.  Shipping was fine.  Colors were fine.  Don't buy if you want something to hold tightly.,0
Spray is good BUT the nozzle stops working with half of the spray left. I have to throw it away. Hot water did not help and the top is clear. There's something wrong with the aerosol.,0
I have used Prevage for years and my face shows the results.,1
"I would love to give this a five, and I would have, except for one thing: the felt tip.
I LOVE stila's formula. I have to always apply a primer and then powder before I put it on, but when I do I don't have to touch it all day!
I switched from KVD, but her formula came off after a few hours and I had to reapply and it just didn't work for me.
The felt tip eventually started fraying so I cut off what was fraying... and then cut more off and more and more until the eyeliner doesn't come out unless you use the sides, which is extremely difficult to do and so I've given up. If stila comes out with a brush tip I will gladly buy it! But for now I am moving on to a brush tip with a formula close to stila's. Hope I can find one.",0
The product barely comes out of the sprayer.  I have not seen any improvement yet and should have by this time.,0
didn't work for me,0
The Best!!,1
more of a tinted lip balm- way over priced,0
I did not receive what I was expecting as far as the scent. I have worn this scent for years This one smells watered down and scent does not last,0
Not sure it was the real thing. Too loose for a compact and the smell was different.,0
"Only one complaint about this nail polish.  It doesn't last long on my finger nails.  The color is lovely, and is longer lasting on my toe nails.",1
"When I started shaving at age 14, double edge safety razors and Shick injector razors (and open blades) were all there was.  I went from double edge safety razor with Wikinson sword blades to Shick injectors, and then Shick adjustables. When multiple blades came out, I joined the craze.  I had stopped at Gillette 3-blade razors, thining that 4 and 5 blade razors are just a gimmick - ""saving time avoiding multiple passes"", ""the first blade ""setting up the second blade for the skin close cut"", etc.  Super foamy shave creams. A lot of marketing bull.  Now I've gone back to double edge razors (the Merkur) and an antique Shick adjustable,  coming to the conclusion that you only need a single blade to get a close shave.  After all of these years I bought the Merkur and had the closest shave I've had in decades.  The Merkur is fabulous .  Same for the Shick adjustable. And I use Spieck's shave soap made in Germany  - inexpensive and not overly foamy.  I bought the Shick adjustable on EBay for travel  - double edged razors always capture the attention of the TSA and they confiscate the blades (understandable). More nicks but the very closest shave. For my neck and jawbone, I use my Braun series 9 wet/dry electric razor with the same shave cream for an extremely close shave in those areas (too bloody using a blade).  This all takes some time but shaving is now a pleasurable activity than a nuisance.",1
"i have used and ordered this product for many years.  I just opened this new bottle to find that it is NOT Unite Hair 7 seconds at all, but a completely watered down product in the correct bottle!!!  What a rip off and actually fraud! Not the correct product at all, very disappointed and want my money back!!!!",0
"I really love using Chi on my hair.  I use it every morning after showering, whether I wash my hair that day or not.  It helps make my hair very healthy-looking and shiny.  I would never think to run out of it!",1
"this makes my skin look great without looking like makeup! and it doesn't feel like sunscreen. BONUS.
it takes very little to cover my face, about a pea sized amount. at first it doesn't look like anything but a couple of minuets pass and my skin looks like a better version of it's self. i don't normally wear makeup but i wanted something nicer then sunscreen for everyday wear. for girls who don't normally wear makeup: you can still see yourself after putting this on.

so basically you don't get flawless skin, but you look like your having a great skin day.

ps: i have amazing sensitive skin, this stuff if anything makes my skin nicer then having any bad reaction.",1
"I got this in light brown.  I have slight hair loss from a medication I was taking, at my crown.  This looks like dirt, & sucks the shine from my hair wherever it falls.  The color is not even remotely brown or light brown.  More grayish black brown. I gave it 2 stars because I like the shake it on container.",0
"I really don't feel like this helps much. My hair seems only slightly easier to brush when I use it. It doesn't feel any more moisturized either, which isn't what I bought it for and I don't think it's even a claim the product makes, but usually detanglers seem to be a little more moisturizing. I will not repurchase. The fragrance is faint and not bad, so that's nice.",0
"When I received the bottles, they had leaked all over the inside of the package. Also, I do not like the new product. Pureology should have kept the previous formula. This one does not have the hold the original 'Pure Volume"" had.",0
"It smells really nice to me. Floral but maybe too synthetic for others. Does an OK job as a makeup setting spray, probably not that different from NYX's matte spray.",1
I really like this product and would recommend it.,1
Love this!  The color is great and goes with everything.  Wonderful product!,1
"For the past 7 or 8 years, I have had very sensitive/reactive skin with persistent 24/7 rosy cheeks and occasional flushing (no bumps of any kind though so I don't think it is technically rosacea). I decided to try this based on the great reviews and I do like it. I apply my regular face moisturizer, my lightly tinted mineral sunscreen, this anti-redness product, and then my lightly tinted loose powder to finish. I would say that gets rid of about 80% of the redness in my cheeks. So, not perfect, but very good. It doesn't look cakey, but not 100% natural either. As others have said, a little bit (truly, about the size of a grain of uncooked rice) spreads and blends to cover one of my cheeks. I definitely wouldn't use more product than that or it would be obvious as it is very green. Overall, this is a moderate coverage product that is easy to work with for a good price.",1
It is easy to use and control and heats quickly.,1
"quick service, good product",1
Did not leave a shine and did not hold a hair style.  Unfortunate since I use several Oribe hair care products and love them - this one did nothing.,0
"I received this 1 1/2 inch curling iron and it worked great twice. On the third day it stopped working completely. The ""on"" indicator light comes on but there is no heat and the barrel remains cold no matter how long I leave it on or at what temperature I set it. I purchased this because my hair stylist recommended the brand but I've never in 40 years had a curling simply stop working like this. Hope I can get a refund.",0
i have somewhat long hair and wanted loose curls. this doesnt even do a wave. i was not impressed. even with hairspray it never had a curl. my hair is easy to work with and it just didn't work for me. it straightened more than anything. i guess its good for doing the bangs in front because who wants curly bangs.,0
"I am really not one to write bad reviews but this blue nail Polish I got left me without words. It was extremely thin, I had to use 4 layers to get to the blue that's supposed to be. Then, of course, it all fell apart in a couple days. Will not be purchasing this again",0
"For nearly three years now Dr Alkaitis' Organic Purifying Facial Toner has been my go to!  I have sensitive, combination skin that is exposed to a lot of sun since I live in Florida and had been looking for a toner that was not animal tested and made with natural ingredients.

Being that the price was a bit steep I was hesitant to invest in this product, but did purchase the $1.99 sampler bottle available on the Dr Alkaitis website and was quickly convinced that this was worthwhile. I suggest doing the same if you may be experiencing similar feelings.

Not only does it have a fresh scent and consistency but it glides on your skin without causing drying or leftover residue.  One of the things I appreciate the most is knowing that the product I am using was made within a month prior to my purchasing it.  Definitely a quality product.

Since I started using this toner I have tried using others but nothing compares.",1
it is not the same strength as the clear one. do not recommend,0
"OK mixed reviews on this.. The shadows are junk..Sorry but as a huge makeup junky they are.. LORAC pro serious shadows are much better I""m not to sure what' the deal with thiat gold..It's awful.. The blush and highlight are the best thing about this pallet.. It's not worth more then 20 bucks at best.. The colors are weird and just off.. IDK not happy.  I feel the Milini line at the drugstore has better shades then this and they are 4 bucks.  Sorry LORAC this is a fail ... I really want to say this is fake because I have some LORAC products and they are GREAT ..But this pallet is junk",0
I have used this shampoo for several years & was quite confused by the lack of lather from my latest purchase!  If it ain't broke........,0
Leaves your skin amazingly soft.  I use retinoids nearly daily and sometimes go overboard.  This brings me back to normal.  PS: I have rosacea and it's not irritated by this product.,1
Didn't work broke,0
"When using, it pulls hair out close to the end. Doesn't Happen every time, but does happen often. Expected it to be smooth.",0
"I'm a barber in a fairly busy shop. I use this daily for edge-ups and the like.
We use hot lather for the back of the neck but I usually apply a thin layer of this first.
I haven't encountered a client yet that has been irritated by this and I have quite a few clients with sensitive skin, so I would say this is fine to use on many skin types.
Works great, but my only complaint is that it can get sticky/tacky after a while (most shave gels do)
For the price, it's the best I've found so far.",1
Made my skin break out in rash underneath my eyes and they would not return product.,0
"I thought this brush blowed hot air but it does not ,my mistake  You have to add a lot of product to get some volume but works fine otherwise",1
Dont waste your money! First after 6 months this hairdryer started burning my hand at the handle if used on the hottest setting. Then after almost a year of only using it on medium it started smoking from the bottom and stopped working all together. A  $100+ blow dryer to quit before even a years time is absurd. Save your money and shop elsewhere.,0
"I have dark circles like a raccoon, so NOTHING completely covers my dark circles; however, the idea is to CONCEAL not COVER, otherwise your eyes start looking old and cakey/crepey with too much makeup.  This does the job for me.",1
I love it! The scent lasts a long time.,1
"been using this brand for years.  A esthitician recommened it and it sold me,  It blends with my skin perfectly",1
A tangle mess!,0
Actually gave me acne :( I wanted to love it,0
"The feel of this lip crayon is wonderful. It goes on smoothly and doesn't feel thick or dry. I actually don't notice it at all once it's on. The color is misleading, however. I got the Nectar Pink Creme, and it is much pinker than what is advertised in the pictures. I still like it a lot! It's not quite the color I wanted or expected, but it looks good on me and I love the feel of it.",1
I've used this for years and highly recommend it!,1
not a good product for me.,0
overpriced rubbing alcohol,0
"I like the Pureology line of products. This was just ""meh"".....for me, after the initial blow out my hair was smooth and straight but within 20 minutes in our GA humid summer, this product does not seal the hair shaft to inhibit frizz.",0
"I am a female, but this intrigued me so I gave it a try.  It has a very pleasant, natural scent.  The serum is thin, but not greasy, and it spreads well.  A little goes a long way.  It dries fast, and you can't even tell it's on your skin, after you put it on.

I don't have many imperfections on my skin.  I was hoping this would improve the youthful look of my skin.  I truly didn't notice a difference in that area.  It works really well as a primer for makeup, so if you are already using a primer, and decide to give this a try, you can use it as a replacement.

I love the scent, the consistency and the quality of the serum.  It didn't do anything for me, but it may be that I don't have the problem skin that it is meant for.  I see that others say this works really well for them.  If you think you have the skin this is designed for, then give it a try.  Based on the quality of the actual serum, I would recommend it.",1
Good but not great!!! There are much better options for few extra bucks!!! I wouldn't purchase again!,0
"Although I didn't buy from amazon, I wanted to write a review. I bought it from ULTA after hearing and seeing many youtubers rave about it. Immediately after spraying I observed that my skin felt dry. It also broke me out. I will be returning this.",0
"good for light peeling , no more no less",0
This product was a life saver for me. My hair has continually got thinner and I really didn't want to buy a wig. A friend told me about this and I can't believe how well it covers thinning areas. You just have to make sure after applying the resisdue isn't on your forehead or back. But it's a great product and worth every penny....,1
"I was very disappointed. I have a very swirly, tough beard, sensitive skin and an incurable bleeding disorder - a tough challenge for any product and this product let me down. I am going back to the Aveeno gel I was using previously. It is far superior.",0
"This was purchased as a gift.  It arrived on time, and packaged well.  No complaints from me.  Would order again as a gift.",1
"Feels like washing with conditioner. Leaves my hair unclean and weighed down. I am a white girl with thin but lots of hair, don't use product, keep it natural, normal to dry.",0
Love the color.,1
smell too strong,0
Works well and smells divine!,1
"I really wanted to love this after reading all of the reviews. I have found that the beauty blender bar soap is the best and gets my foundation brushes to turn white. However it is expensive and only 1oz... so I thought with the great reviews on this item that it might be as good as the beauty blender bar and I would get twice as much product. However  it's just OK at cleaning my make up brushes. It does smell great but it makes them feel very squeaky clean but not actually clean on the brush great, it's just ok. Another option I have found is Dr. Bronner's bars of soap all in one they are 5 ounces and about three or four dollars.  Dr. Bronner's is able to get my brushes white also, however there is kind of a weird soap buildup when you wash them so I still prefer the beauty blender bar.",0
"I needed to replace an aging H2O face brush,  this one photographed well, and looked like a quality product.  the handle is slippery and difficult to hold onto,  The bristles are too soft to exfoliate any skin,  I think they spent more money on the packaging than on the actual product.",0
dry out my baby's scalp,0
"I really can't tell a difference that this is even on. It was not effective for me, unfortunately. Baby powder is much more effective. It's a shame because the product was very costly.",0
I really liked this mask. It helped lighten my scars up from acne by using it every other night. If you use it more u might get at least one whitehead from it but that should not scare you from purchasing it. The delivery was fast and good as well. I will absolutely purchase again.,1
Great!!,1
This was a mistake on my part.  I did not realize there was a difference between Extra Body Finishing Spray and Extra Body FIRM Finishing Spray.  The Firm spray is better for my fine hair.,0
Loved my samples could be bigger.  I should have VIDEO my samples.,1
I got this as a stocking stuffer for my wife this past Christmas and she commented that it works exactly as described.  It will be a staple in her manicure products going forward.,1
Really love this lotion... It's a bit pricey,1
"Ive used this product for months, and it works great.  My lashes definitely grew thicker and longer.  With mascara on my friends thought I had fake lashes on.  Highly recommend!",1
Perfect.,1
"Cana Neon is a neon pink color, not the dark sparkly gray pictures here!",0
"I love obagi products and have used them for years.  This eye cream goes on smooth and does not irritate my sensitive eyes, but I can't say I have noticed a huge difference in wrinkles.",1
"No where near the same as the original one, Very unhappy with this one",0
Love it! It's non-drying and gives my damaged hair an extra sheen that doesn't weigh it down.,1
"I bought these a couple of months ago for my PMD and when I tried using them just barely they were too long for my PMD and did not work. I am unable to return them now, and am rather disappointed. It should be stated which PMD these are adaptable with. I should have tried them with my PMD right away, but I didn't question it.",0
"I really like this cleansing head. My face feels clean, but not stripped.",1
Broke my skin out. Smells good but cant use it.,0
"My daughter has eczema so bad, it looked like she had third degree burns all over both of her wrists. I call the dermatologist requesting an appointment to reevaluate her to see if it was something else causing this horrible rash on her wrist. The doctor actually called me and told me to try this cream before I came in. I rolled my eyes but did it anyway, because I have literally bought every single cream, lotion, and balm that you can find for eczema. Somethings have worked temporarily, but then it would always flair right back up.
Well, this stuff WORKS! AND IT KEEPS WORKING!!! Even though it completely cleared her up by using it only twice a day, I still put it on once or twice a day and it is yet to come back!
When I got this product in the mail, I was sure it would not work, it is very watery, it's not thick at all. But this is the best cream I've ever used and I have literally spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars trying out creams, balms, lotions, body washes, everything on the market and this is the only thing that continues to work.",1
"Because the DermaBlend foundation stays on so well during the day,  I didn't really need this product.  I've used it for highlighting and such but it's not really needed for quick fixes because their foundation stays so well.
Still a nice took to have though!",1
Nice smell but as a moisturizer it doesn't last long...at least in my case.,1
When I received the packge the cover was open I do not know Can I use it or not.,0
"Gorgeous color,  Stays on for at least a week.  Great quality nail polish.",1
"This product,  unfortunately,  did not help nor prevent diaper rash. On the plus side,  it is light and has no fragrance.",0
"This soap has turned me into a soap snob. Not this scent in particular but this brand. Prior to the fateful day I received one of these as a gift, I always considered body wash a fungible commodity, buying a different one every time I went to the store. And now, here I am, buying expensive soap off Amazon. But believe me when I say I cannot find anything that feels this soft, washes so well, or rinses off so completely anywhere else.",1
Gives me confidence.  A necessary part of my daily routine.,1
Good stuff,1
"my hair stylist used this on me a few times before I bought it for myself.  I LOVE the smell of it, and it makes my hair feel nice, especially when I blow dry it. Would buy again.",1
"If you have thin, fine hair, this is not the product for you.  The thickening spray did not give me increased density or volume whatsoever.  It gave me shine, but completely flattened my hair when hair-drying.  While I find the R+Co Dallas thickening shampoo, conditioner and Rodeo Star foam to be holy grails in terms of volumizing my thin fine hair, I was sorely disappointed with the thickening spray.  I gave the spray 2 stars because at least the ingredients are safe for colored/dyed hair. I bought the thickening spray from a local salon.

If you like using a volumizing/thickening spray, I would recommend Aveda's Thickening Tonic (see the review by kheebl on Amazon).  I've tried many high end brands (Davines, Shu Uemura, Bumble & Bumble, Phyto) and the Aveda Tonic is the best volumizing spray available.",0
"I ordered this and it was marked Medium Brown in the computer when I ordered it.  When I received it, the container said Black, with a sticker covering it that said Medium Brown.  It is definitely BLACK, and I cannot use it.  How deceptive.",0
This product arrived with a large dent in the metal bottle.  I find it did not live up to its advertisement and would like to return it.,0
"Barely any coverage (even for a tinted moisturizer), left an greasy sheen, irritating (stinging feeling.) Not impressed with Juice Beauty so far at all (their mascara is also very poorly formulate/irritating.)",0
I got such bottle with defect. Came liquid out of the bottle. I made photoes. I can proove but i have no place to attache it.,0
Big and clunky.,0
Love that is cruelty free! Perfect for applying over makeup,1
Love this product. It makes my hair super soft and not greasy.  The price is also great. Found it for a lot more in other departments stores.,1
It's good,1
I've had better,0
"I was sadly disappointed with this product. It leaves my skin dry and leathery. Yes it has great coverage and I suppose it's a good sunscreen. I have to stop using it because not only do I have to use a moisturizer under it, it has caused my face to breakout. I wanted a 3 in one like Aveeno Tinted Moisturizer",0
"This is a FAKE! I bought this over a month ago and just got around to using it tonight. I should have been tipped off by the very fake lemon smell, but I thought it was a new formula. WRONG! I just got out of the shower and my face is burning horribly. Hoping to get a full refund.. I'll stick to getting at ulta from now on",0
Too expensive....not worth it but I love the smell and sprays so light.  My hair doesn't feel weighed down but not sure it really replenishes.,1
My son loves Lacoste and looks forward to receiving this every Christmas.  He loves using it and uses it sparingly so that it can last him longer.,1
I thought I was ordering the larger version of this product and received the 10oz. At $20+ dollars you can get this much cheaper locally.,0
I'm a huge Essie fan and loved this color in the salon. Bought on Amazon and it was goopy and not the quality I've learned to expect. Something was off.,0
"The pump doesnt work on this. Day one it worked... day two almost just air. Either its Empty or broken.
Cant we have a container that we can actually see the product so we know what were getting ?",0
Product arrived with broken cover.,0
Very disappointed. The eye liner was practically dried out. Will not buy again,0
I had hope given the rave reviews but this didn't do anything for me. I have used the whole tube and my hands are still in really bad shape.,0
Love the vitamins & my hair is growing,1
The Heat guard attachment constantly pops off & there's nothing you can do about it. Don't waste your money,0
"For the price, I would expect this not to rub off quite so dramatically. If I touch my chest an hour or two after applying, I literally have to go wash gunk off my hands.",0
"I purchased this flat iron on Oct. 18 and today, December 7, it wouldn't turn on.  Then I noticed the plate looks like it has melted out of the unit.  I'm going to try to get a refund or a replacement.  I would not recommend anyone purchase this product.  Very disappointed.",0
I wanted something that would give my fine hair a boost without feeling sticky. Tried a sample of Paul Mitchell Extra Body Daily Boost spray and now I'm back getting another bottle. This spray is a miracle!,1
Not very shiny and bottle was broken upon arrival,0
"When i received this item i was unable to use it right away.. However i used it yesterday and again today .. The minty sensation as described was definitely not felt and it was the main reason for me to purhase this item...
My hair dresser used this product on my hair previously. With that in mind i did not hesitate to purchase the item but now i regret it since it does not seem to be the product as described .. '",0
My husband switched from suavecito to this and loves it!,1
This smells terrible. I took it to Macy's to compare and it's not the same. It's musky and gives me a headache immediately.,0
"super love this product! as i was rubbing it in circular motions, the dead skin started to just roll off leaving my skin soft and smooth! it also helped clean out my pores on my nose ",1
"This brush is very dense yet super soft, perfect for when you want full coverage for powder foundations.  I own several brands of powder brushes from high end to medium range and this is one of my favorites!  Good price on Amazon for a great brush!",1
"I love Essie nail polish, but for some reason this one chips off very easily. Maybe it's the shimmer.",0
My face feels smoother & feels better to the touch & like brighter.,1
"I use this several times a week.  I have fair skin with freckles, a red patch and age spot.  After several weeks of use, the freckles had diminished and the red patch was gone.  This was two years ago and my face still looks good.  The age spot, unfortunately, hasn't faded.",1
This is the greatest shampoo.  It makes you hair feel really clean and it doesn't make your hair look wash out if you hair has coloring.  Also the smell is out of the world.  With this product your hair and scalp feels really clean.,1
"i only bought this based on the reviews....i'm shocked that it has earned so many 5 star reviews...this spray is useless to me.  It does not hold, it doesn't help with humidity...really, it offers nothing in my opinion...wish i could get my money back...i have to go back to Sebastian Mega hold, it's the only one that works well without feeling frozen..
my hair type is thick, medium curly and medium long with layers...if that helps",0
Im returning this item because it says made in USA and not France!,0
It does make your skin really soft .,1
"Great product, works well with my hair, thick. Does not weigh down your hair and always soft and smells great.",1
just as I expected,1
This may be my top 3 beauty products of all time. I have super oily skin that gets acne at times. This stuff is AMAZING. Forget the price because it will last you months! It covers blemishes and red spots while moisturizing and giving you SPF protection. I'm telling anyone who buys this will fall in love. Overall just a great product.,1
"I'm a guy who doesn't like lotion, and doesn't care for scented things. This stuff is amazing. It heals my skin, doesn't feel like lotion, and smells like... sandlewood or something. Just awesome.",1
"The best foundation I've ever tried! I like how it goes on light, like the liquid is thin but it covers well, making my skin really look poreless and smooth. I have combination skin so my T-Zone gets super oily fast and I have big pores on my nose, so I'm happy to FINALLY find a foundation that lasts all day and makes my skin look perfect! I only have to blot my face maybe 2-3 times and don't have to reapply. I've gotten so many compliments using this! My sister said my skin looked like it was glowing - like in that healthy dewy way :) I hope to gooood they never discontinue this product!",1
"This stuff makes my natural curly coarse hair even drier than it was before I tried it. I have been told to use products a few times to see how it works. Well it doesnt work, at least for me.",0
The soap is nice works well makes good lather. I have tried a few others and so far this seems to be the best.,1
"I had problems with my scalp being dry and flaky and using Agadir shampoo, conditioner, and oil treatment changed that and I wanted to continue making my hair healthier by using the moisture masque. I am not disappointed.",1
Aroma was too strong for me,0
A great product.  I have been using this since I was a little girl.  I love everything about it and would highly recommend it.,1
This dries my hair so much faster and the cold shot button does not need to be held down to work.  It was well worth the money.,1
It's awesome for when you need to get rid of a break out fast,1
"I am
Not sure if this real. The bottle different and the brush already broke off and is stuck inside the bottle. I have been using neulash for more then 10yrs and I haven't seen any results which I usually do. But in 4-6 weeks my lashes will
B super
Thick and long. Beware this might not be the real deal",0
No instructions and can't figure out how it could possibly screw into the xfusion bottle.  Should have saved my money and not bother with buying this.,0
I  don't think the quality matches the price. seems so cheap.,0
I have used many self tanners over the years and was very excited to try this top rated mousse.  Unfortunately I have an allergy to the product and my skin became very red and inflamed.  I have used Tanwise mousse with no skin reaction problems so I would recommend that product to anyone who experiences skin reactions to this product.,0
"I've had great results with Strivectin for years.

Here's a tip: there is always quite a bit of product that cannot be squeezed out of the cap-end of the tube. I cut the end of the tube off with scissors and use a chip clip to keep it sealed. I usually get about two weeks worth of product that would otherwise be left around the cap. This stuff is too spend to waste",1
"I had high hopes for this product but unfortunately, I hated it from the moment I put it on. It felt very slick and oily, a problem I have with silicone based products such as many primers. It does eventually set into a matte finish but for my combo/oily skin, it set very strange and patchy despite trying to work it in.",0
Did a very good job drying my hair. Sounds like a Ferrari compared to store models. But it is heavy! That's why I gave 4 stars.,1
"It's an okay product. Personally I prefer honeybee gardens nail polish because it quite literally has no toxic smell (but this one does). I also found that this product chipped, but then was very hard for me to take off. It made my nails far more dry than I am used to, so I gave it away as a white elephant gift. I had hoped for more sparkle (and it is a matt finish). I guess the real turn off for me is that in certain lights it looks more red than magenta, and for my olive skin tone I didn't like how it looked. Also, when showing to friends, they just nodded (aka they didn't like it either). So although some might love this product, it just wasn't for me.",0
"no difference at all.  waste of money.  I do like the Philosophy brand, but this is not a great product.",0
"Be careful when you order this. They show you a tube with a lovely color of gloss, but what you're actually getting is a clear gloss. Read closely. I did not.",0
"This is smooth, soothing and very invigorating.  The scent is lovely.

This is a very high end product.  From the heavy glass bottle to the gentle formula that is unmistakable in it's quality, this product is perfect for the refined gentleman.",1
"Way too runny for me. Perhaps its psychological but unless I can see the tint on my face, I feel like I'm not getting any sun protection. This says its tinted, however, it appears to dry clear. If you like zero coverage and very light feeling on your face, then this is for you. Unfortunately, I waited too long and missed the window to send it back. So in the trash it goes.",0
Does the job what more is there to say,1
ok so far will see,1
I absolutely loved this.  Feels great on my skin and has a nice scent to it.  Doesn't irritate my skin and doesn't feel heavy or too oily,1
BEST STUFF IN THE WORLD. Been using on curly wavy hair for years. So good. Make it smooth and manageable.,1
"Gentle, yet seems to be effective. I wish the scent was more lemony, but, it has a bit of a muted lemon tone. I like the face wash best.",1
Clears up acne sometimes overnight!!,1
Fabulous curls that last and I saw I love it worth the price,1
"Love it!!!! Don't use it as often as I should. Being 30 and with very little wrinkles and also getting botox in areas of concern, it is hard to notice the difference, but I do feel like it helps with my complexion. I'm happy I got it though.",1
"I read that this oil smelled good and did wonderful things for your hair.  Be warned that unless you like musky smells like Poison or Opium perfume, this oil spray stinks.  I couldn't stand smelling that on my hair all day.  It's going straight into the trash because it's not worth trying to return.  If you're the least bit sensitive to strong smells, don't buy this product.",0
Ordered this product and received a 1 oz instead.  Buy at your own risk.,0
"It arrived in okay time. The description wasn't clear that it's a mens product. I don't have any use for this product, being I'm a women. I still have not received a refund",0
Love this product. It makes my hair healthy and shiny,1
Doesn't work. Very disappointing considering I use Zeno which works wonderfully . Was hoping this was similar but just a larger version,0
"A new L'Occitane product! Of course I had to try it! Removed stubborn blackheads around nose & chin, yet gentle enough for the remainder of my face. A must!",1
"I've used Derma Blend makeup for years. It hides flaws and makes my skin even toned.
I used to get it at JCPennys,but they stopped ordering the makeup line.",1
Beautiful colors until i put them on my skin and they don't show up. I have fair skin and the eye shadows barely show up.,0
"I read the reviews and like the packaging but this stuff is way to strong. The smell is very strong to the point I had to hold my breath when I used it for first couple of times. I do like the fragrance after I've used it. Once it washes away, it smells really good. I'll have to find something else.",0
I used thus according to instructions and the Polish came right off. My regular polish with vase and top coat stays on longer.,0
"Very, very disappointed with this product.
It did not add any shine and made my hair feel less clean.
A total waste of $25.00!",0
Did not really cover my roots at all. Was disappointed.,0
hard to find double edge razor blades in local stores.amazon delivered them in 2 days,1
"I really love this product line but compared to the first one I purchased direct from company, this one was watery and when I flip the lid to use it, it pours out the bottom and so much is wasted. I would like to return it but I passed the window I guess. I didn't need it right away so I didn't use it for a while. I won't order this from Amazon again.",0
"If you use the shampoo, you need the styling crme. You don't need to use as much shampoo and do not need to
leave in a little for conditioner. Just use the crme on wet hair. I have very thin hair and it gives it body and feels thicker.",1
"I love the scent.  If you use too much, your hair gets crunchy. A little goes a long way.",1
bottle came half open The pump didn't work. Used it a couple times then threw it away. I didn't like the residue it left on my hands either. It did smell good though.,0
"Nice scent, I don't like sweet smelling candles, so this is perfect.  It is more of a spicy scent.",1
"Was a gift, she really likes it .",1
"Except for the price of Bliss products, I like them a lot",1
This product will be used by me regularly. It moisturize my skin as I like.,1
Works great on super curly hair!! Very soft.,1
"If you have hair on the thinner side, go with a donut-type bun maker.",0
Is a great everyday color. Neutral with just a little hint of metallic. I really like it for work!,1
"Very Bad!!! hasn't emergency bottom to stop, then you'll end up cutting your hair to open.",0
"The aurora borealis shade is great! Not too blue/green based , ideal for olive skin tones. The Rose gold is subtle but can be built up for more dramatic results.  The silver plum shade is very stylish and versatile.  Of course the silver is fabulous.  That said, my only complaint would be the liquid suspension . The shadow is in would be easier to work with if it was a tad bit thicker/dried quicker.",1
"I haven't used it too long yet, but so far so good. I've got pretty serious KP, epecially serious since my skin's so dark. My skin is DEFINATLY smoother; before you could feel the bumps, now you can only see them. Not sure if it'll get rid of the sight as well, but I've got hope since I've only been using the product for about a week. We'll see!",1
Cans were 3/4 full and dented:(. Lotion is still great.,0
"This polish is very streaky and thick. Once applied, it does not ""settle"", or ""merge"" well with the rest of the polish. Also, the color was quite brighter than one would expect by looking at the bottle. It is very matte, and as I've said, it just won't settle well (causing a streaky finish).There is also no shine, but I'm sure a clear topcoat could easily remedy this. Hope my review was helpful!",0
"Yes,it an nice gel not too oily but keep your eyes smooth",1
"I will attempt to review and rate this shaving kit from the perspective that money is no object. Every man places a different value on his beard and many shoppers have varying amounts of disposable cash. Personally I find the $120 price tag jaw-dropping, not because the product is poor, but because that's $120 for a tub of shaving cream, a bottle of oil, aftershave lotion and a brush. When you consider them individually, that's only $30 for each item which doesn't sound nearly as intimidating. But still, I'm the kind of person who holds onto spare ketchup packets and a can of Barbasol is like 99 cents. It's hard for me to ignore the price, but for the purpose of this review, I will do so.

Okay, so with that preface out of the way, let's talk about each item:

'Pure Badger' Shaving Brush: We've all seen the 1920s imagery of barbers expertly swathing their customers with thick shaving cream before cleaning up their beard with a straight edge razor. This brush is obviously a throwback to that era. Is it cool? Sure, it's cool. Is it superior to applying shaving cream with your fingers? Um, kinda I guess. It does allow you to be less wasteful with the shaving cream. I find that if you gently dust the top of the cream with the brush you're able to apply more and in more even strokes than with fingers. Regardless, it's a nice luxury item that makes the kit more gifty and fun. I don't know that it's so amazingly awesome that I would feel I have to use the brush to shave for the rest of my life.

Pre-Shave Oil: This is probably my favorite item in the kit. It's somewhat unique - not many shaving kits include a pre-shave product - and really does prep your beard for shaving. Hairs do seem softer and so does your skin. I love the way it feels. A little oily, but super hydrating and refreshing. They say it doesn't leave any oily residue but I'd say it doesn't leave very MUCH. The little residue it leaves is actually nice though, in my opinion. I don't mind it at all.

Shaving Cream: I would be lying if I said this wasn't the best shaving cream I've ever used. It has the absolute perfect amount of consistency to help glide your razor and feels so fresh on the skin. I would like to buy a gallon jug of the stuff.

After-Shave: The after-shave feels really good on the skin but I didn't necessarily find it super-effective. I still got an in-grown hair every now and then and it makes my face look a little oily/shiny. There's no alcohol in it, however, which is much appreciated. Alcohol can be really damaging to the skin and doesn't help that much after a shave.

Scent: The kit I received was 'unscented' which is the most practical because there are a lot of people with fragrance allergies and sometimes perfumes can be harmful to the skin. The lack of scent makes the kit feel much less luxurious, however. I got jealous reading the other reviews rave about the different scents. But like I say, for the serious shaver or man with ultra sensitive skin, unscented is the way to go. For a luxurious gift, one of the fragranced versions would probably be recommended to add that extra touch of class.

OVERALL: Ultimately the quality of your shave will depend on the quality of your razor and your expertise at handling it. The pre-shave and after-shave oils will help, especially for those of us with sensitive skin, and the shaving cream is such a treat, but you still need to know what you're doing to have a great shave. I think all the products in this kit are as superior as I've ever used, but maybe not so much so that I'd be willing to pay the premium price on a regular basis. But with that being said, $30 a bottle really isn't THAT bad. Certainly women pay much more for tiny samples of lotion and creams. It's only fair that us men have our luxuries as well.",1
doesn't work well on my hair  still leaves it dry looking.,0
"supposedly this stuff is better than nioxin. so far i think i agree. i have been using this shampoo for about 2 years. i used nioxin for 10 years previously.

i'm still losing hair-- but i am not bald. i am pretty sure all the crap i am using has helped me prevent hair loss... then again, i can't prove it--",1
"I absolutely loved this stuff.  One application and no more ingrown hairs by the next day.  No stinging, no problems.  I've used it for the last 2 years, however I recently ordered more and was wondering why it didn't work this time.  So I used it again and still had ingrown hairs the next day.  l had an old box so I compared the ingredients with the new box and they changed!!!  Ack!  It doesn't work anymore!!!  Anyone else having this trouble?  Very very sad about this!!!

UPDATE! August 2009:  Ok, so I noticed the packaging changed...again.  It's now in this blue container, so I took a chance and bought it and it does seem to be just as wonderful as it used to be.  It seems it first was in a light color jar with pink writing (worked great!), then a light color jar with dark blue writing (worked awful!), now in a bright blue jar (works great again!)  So if you get the latest formula, I would definitely recommend this.  I would change this review to 5 stars, but the program doesn't let me.  Thank you Bliss!",0
Great moisturizer.  Very soothing and I definitely see how it keeps my skin softer,1
"I love Mizani products, but I don't know if something was wrong with this.  It smelled fine as I sprayed it on my hair, but once it dried, it smelled like mildew.  It was sooooo disgusting. I had to wash my hair again.  I gave it another try, just to make sure that's what it was, and yes, it was definitely from the product.  I've never had anything but good things to say about Mizani, so maybe this was just a fluke.",0
No scent,0
"Love the scent, not to sure that I would call it a great option for exfoliating your skin.",0
"Great product, great price",1
MY sons skin broke out,0
"not greasy, high quality sun protection. I love it",1
Been using for 3 weeks and my nails have shown no improvement and are still peeling. Not worth the money.,0
"This is a good moisturizer. It's not light weight in my opinion and a little goes a long way, so I prefer to use this at night. You don't need much product at all and it feels smooth when you apply it to your skin.

Be warned though, on the bottle you can see that this product contains dimethicone. Dimethicone gives your skin that instant smooth silky feel, but this ingredient can be irritating for people who are acne prone or are sensitive to this ingredient.

Since it does have that smoothing property, I use this under makeup. I only use the tiniest amount though because using too much of this product can cause pilling.

This product has a strong scent in my opinion. Scents personally do not bother me, but for some people it does. This product smells fresh and floral, kind of like a mature perfume.

Overall, this product would be good for dry skin because it's VERY moisturizing.",1
Pricey not sure if it is working.,0
"I love the Image Skincare line of products so I wanted to try this product.  Besides the pump being broken upon the first use, I had to take the lid off to see if I could fix it but instead found a thick cream instead of a serum.  There was no way that thick cream was going to go through that small pump, even if it did work.  Even when I tried to get some out of the bottle, it was so thick, it would even budge.  I'm not sure what this product is supposed to look like but I had to return it.  I will read some of the reviews before ordering again.  No problems with returning the product with a full refund.",0
Miracle in a bottle will purchase again and again!! I m 33 years old and got carded after using this product !! Smells so good and leaves my skin glowing and vibrant! Absolutely in love !,1
"This liquid foundation has a sheer finish, but is buildable for more coverage. I like the finish it leaves on my skin, it looks natural and doesn't dry my skin like other foundations do.",1
Great brush. Applies eye shadow nicely.,1
"Good product, but it is only a deodorant, not an anti-persperant. Great when you don't need extra protection",1
Horrible razors.  Bought two and both are poorly designed.  We had to throw them away because the blade does not stick out far enough to enable a decent shave.  Totally useless waste of money.,0
Very sticky and the color does not look like the advertisement at all.  Very disappointed with quality and how it looks on my lips.,0
I purchased this as a replacement for the identical one I've used for the past 3 or 4 years.  It's the best hair dryer I've ever used; drys my hair in less time and leaves it with lots of shine and no static electricity.,1
works better than anything else i have tried so far for removing shellac polish. does seem to have a slight moisturizing effect on my nails as well.,1
"The colors are amazing , the eye pen even is Wow",1
"this stuff is okay.. i mean, it does make your hair look fuller but it also clumps together . maybe i should try getting the applicator. i will see about ordering an applicator , but by itself the product clumps. its like throwing just black powder on your head. it doesn't really stick that well , but its not bad to be honest. its good for someone who wants thicker looking hair but i think the applicator is necessary to get good coverage.",0
"Soooo. I just got this and was so happy to get it. Well. For this price, I am completely stunned that the pictured goggles to protect your eyes are an  elastic string that is not attached at all to two tiny.....pieces.... of goggle-ish eye things. Not sure what that is all about. It's called follow through and quality in what you sell!! I would be utterly embarrassed by the do it yourself style-not-really-goggles and it makes me question the entire product itself. I WILL use it and I WILL update my review soon. I have 4 people in our house that can definitely utilize this type of therapy for arthritis, sport strains, at this moment. In fact I myself used it today. So far the jury is out on the actual device, but an epic fail on the ""goggles"" which you need for this kind of stuff and which I specifically wanted, to protect the eyes.",0
"As a Nail Clipper, it works fine. But it is made in Vetnam, not in Germany. Compare to the price, it is not worth to buying it.",0
"Wow, my hubby smells really nice.  He wants only subtle fragrances like me. Jist a spray in the air to walk through.

Ha Ha - In error he got it on his hands.  He tried to wash it off his hands so he could play guitar, and it wouldn't come off.  Men do not want to smell up a room, and by no means does he want the scent on his guitar.  He told me how many years it took for him to get someone's body odor off his guitar.

I do not think this is overpowering, though.  It has a clean scent with chilled cucumber, citrus cocktail, water lotus, drenched green leaves Mid notes  Szechuan pepper, lavender, white cedarwood Base notes  Sandalwood, guaiac wood, patchouli, musks.

I love musks on me and on my husband both!  I never once doubted that this cologne would disappoint, and it didn't.  Next I'll try plain Eternity (not aqua) both by Calvin Klein.  I will come back and do a comparison so I can tell you which one I like best with a description.

Highly recommended!",1
best sunscreen i ever used...Have been consistently using this for the last 3 summers!,1
After a month the bristles started melting.,0
"Poor quality. This ""wonderful"" curling iron just died in a month!",0
"It hardly seems to shave at all. When I screw the razor together with the blade there is just a small slit. It shaves, but leaves a lot of stubble. If I unscrew it a little ways it does shave a lot better, but the shaver is loose. I am wondering if I should bought an adjustable or another blade would be sturdier making the slit larger. I shaved with a disposable afterwords and it did a better job than with it tight.",0
Quality product that helped my acne after one day,1
"The colors of the OPI Burlesque series are sensational...however, the polish goes on makikng the nails feel as if there were sand paper on top of them.  It chips at the slightest touch, but removing from nails altogether is a major hassle...acetone polish required, and nails have to soak for at least one minute, then only 1/2 comes off, involving another soaking before all polish could be removed.  I bought four of these in different colors...have thrown them all out and I love OPI polish more than most.",0
Terrible! Wouldn't even stay on for 24  hours,0
"It is okay but I believe that its fake. Although this is my first Wen product ever, that container nor the product met my expectations. The container looked used as well when I first got it. Never buying it again",0
"I love the purple color.  It's not in your face purple, but almost a little more pink and soft looking.  The one thing that I'm still on the fence about is the flat sheen.  It's not really matte and not shiny.  I haven't decided how I feel about that.",1
Good price! It is great when you just apply the cream. However an hour later the skin is not moisturized  JS,0
"Gradual, and natural looking.  The best product I have ever tried.  Lovely scent and good moisturizer are extra bennies!",1
"The lip stick is runny and too much comes out when applying it with the applicator. Plus, it's dry looking and the color is more flesh color than the color in the picture. it does stay on well, though. Although I had to put another color on top and then gloss over it.",0
Smells like the scented Strawberry Shortcake dolls of my childhood. Instant headache.,0
"I don't have facial acne but get severe cystic outbreaks on my shoulders and upper back from bra straps. I have a deep boxcar scar and am trying to avoid any more. This seems to work well when applied overnight and showered off in the morning. I wear a white t-shirt and sleep on white linens to avoid ruining any sleepwear or bedding.

Id say this is not a casual topical but serious treatment for significant acne. I do t have a ton of sensation in the places I use this but it does burn a bit. When I began using this I felt a cyst erupting and afterwards it simply went away. Used with care it is one more tool to fight scarring acne.",1
"I already knew I loved the fragrance.  However, I was disappointed to find NO packing material in the box.  The smell of Euphoria was strong, and the spray nozzle was a little damp with perfume when I took the cap off.  I won't order fragrance on line again.",1
"I can tell a definite difference in the appearance and texture of my skin. Be sure to use it properly (check the pevonia website if you need to or talk to your aesthetician). I just bought my second jar. I use it every 2 or 3 nights. When I first bought it I used it once or twice and didn't feel like it made a difference, but after a facial and learning how I'm supposed to use it, and using it regularly, it has become a permanent step in my routine. I love it and highly recommend it. By the way, I have oily/sensitive skin.",1
Great price for a great product. I love the big size of these rollers and the felt covering over each one so my hair will not burn. The only thing I don't care for is that you cannot move your head too much after clipping them down. That is ok though because I only have to wear them for about 5 minutes or less. These rollers do what I needed them to do and that was to smooth my hair.,1
"Light, non greasy, and very protective",1
"It's good but completely overpriced! I thought it was really good until one day I didn't have it with me and needed to shave and used my Nivea body wash instead and that worked surprisingly well. Now I use the Nivea Active 3 and it works much better than the hydroplane; it produces less friction, giving me a less irritated shave (I use a Panasonic wet/dry electric shaver). The hydroplane feels really smooth when you first put it on, but after a few passes with my electric shaver, it starts producing friction and I have to reapply another layer; I don't have that problem with the Active 3 plus it's dirt cheap compared to the hydroplane.",0
NO NOTICEABLE CHANGE.,0
After reading the great reveiws about this product I purchased it. I'm just sorry to say it did nothing for the puffiness under my eyes!!!!,0
I didn't want a deodorant with a fragrance but was most looking forward to the fact it wouldn't leave a stain which it absolutely does.,0
It was too thick for someone with fine lines.,0
This is my second Foreo Luna purchase.  I bought one for myself and then one for my mom.  We both used Clarisonic before and both prefer the Luna.  It's not as harsh on our faces and cleans very well.,1
"Did not last one day. Three nails chipped the following morning. I do not like that you do not use a basecoat. Seems more like regular polish than a gel type. Not sure if that what is was supposed to represent, but no way this lasts a week. I keep getting peeling on the sides of the nails and then chips off. I did gel nail polish before, but removal of gels destroyed my nails, and took 3-4 months to grow out and recover. So I was looking for something that would not damage my nails on removal and last a little longer that traditional polish, this is not it.",0
The consistency is a bit thicker than drug store lotion.  It smells like the odor of withering and dead grocery store flower petals.  A faint smell.  But the only smell.,0
These curling iron does get hot and curl very short hair well.,1
Burns my eyes and face.,0
My go to facial setting spray. Feels so refreshing!,1
My hair is dry so I was hoping this would help with that dry brittle look...but it didn't.  It made my hair feel soft while wet but not when it dried...felt sticky and dry,0
Excellent product! Leaves my hair soft and less frizzy and it smells great too!!,1
I love the way this product dispenses - nice rich gel turning into a powerful foam.,1
"see a difference, easy to use .",1
Great Product!!,1
"I bought this specifically because people said it played well under makeup.  Nope, it doesn't. It's true that it is matte and if you are wearing it alone and you rub it in really well you will probably like it.  However it is terrible over serums or under makeup. Balls up into little white flecks and is very difficult to blend in. Do not leave the house without checking yourself in the mirror. You will have dry white smears everywhere and little pieces of it sticking in your eyebrows that will look like dandruff.  My makeup would not go on smoothly over it.",0
"I like this curling iron. I have owned several of them. The one complaint I have is that the spring/hinge wears out so fast. The curling iron comes with an extra hinge but after having mine for a few months it is squeaking. I can buy the springs for cheap at a hair store, so not a big deal. I just wish they made that part a little more durable.",1
So far i like the product.  I understand it works over time and i have only used it for several weeks.,1
SO sosososososo smelly. I am just not into that. For some reason I thought it would be subtle. I cannot comment on the functionality of the stuff because I was not able to use it with any regularity.,0
As soon as we opened the box you could tell it was a fake... bottle had cheap stickers on it and the smell dissipated without 10 minutes of applying :(,0
Everything was perfect,1
"I am using this for only a week and I know it's not that long but my skiing get really dry in winter, I used this every day morning and night and already my dry spots are gone. My husband even commented on my skinSo I did not give it 5 stars because it's still really early, but it got a well deserved 4 stars. ",1
"I get my hair cut at the Paul Mitchell school in South Florida.  I bought a liter and used it for a few months. At first I loved it. Later on I ended up hating it. Totally dried my hair out. Like, really dri d my hair out.

One of the guy instructors at PM told me that the same thing happened to him.  He doesn't use it anymore.

*And he said, from what he has seen, Double Hitter only works for those who have thick hair*.

If you have normal to thin hair, forget using this long term.",0
This is a good way to try this skin line.  I have acne and this is a good affordable line to use for acne.  It is drying so I would recommend following the instructions of starting out slow and building up the usage.  I think I will purchase it again.,1
Weak motor. Doesn't exfoliate very effectively. Cheaply made plastic replacement tips don't last very long. Save your money and purchase something more substantial and powerful such as Trophy Skin's MicroDerm MD or Microderm GLO. I own the MicroDerm MD and love it. The Microderm GLO is smaller but has good reviews.,0
"The machine works as advertised - the suction can be slight or excruciating, it's up to you!  The only bad thing is it was difficult for me to move it back and forth, maybe it had to do with the amount of suction I had set...I'm able to move it one direction in one long strip and start again in a different area (or the same area).  I hope to see some results soon!",1
I've used the lavender in this product line and love it. I find this tea version leaves much to be desired.,0
"Great little gadget! Everything rolled up is no bigger than half you hand. I have chest length hair and I've used it to straighten it all in a pinch but I wouldn't suggest buying it for that use.
The exterior seems to get a bit hotter than I expected and there isn't much protection for the fingers that are gripping the outside of it. If you're using it to straighten some fly-aways or bangs then it's just what you need",1
Beautiful color.,1
Great for what is intended for.,1
Pulls your hair! I returned it.,0
Love it!,1
"I have very oily skin and I break out a lot in the summer because of the oil and sweat, and then I often end up drying my face out by using too much micellar water to overcompensate. I have been spraying this on my face twice a day for about two weeks and at first I though it might be sticky and going to break me out. To my pleasant surprise there is a very obvious difference in my skin texture. Even if I forget to use it for a day, my skin is so much more clear, dewy and taught . I will be buying a second bottle very soon, and will continue to use this spray.",1
"I set this iron to the LOWEST setting and it burnt a section of my hair off. I have professionally color treated and cut, medium thick, normal hair about shoulder length. I round brush, curl, and straighten my hair all the time, so I am no stranger to styling tools. I twisted a 1 inch section around for a few seconds and when I unrolled the iron, most of that section of hair was burnt onto the iron. Now I have a section of hair that is only a few inches long on my head, luckily it is underneath the rest of my hair so it is less conspicuous. I also noticed that the plastic cap had started to melt, too. The iron had started to smoke a tiny bit before I began to curl, but the directions specifically said this was normal for the first use because of oil on the iron.

I saw the other review with a video of this after it happened and thought that person must have gotten a bad iron or didn't know how it worked or even had something weird in her hair. Then I was very careful to use the iron correctly and it happened to me in the exact same manner. I will not buy another Hot Tools Product. I do not understand how anyone can use this iron. It gets way too hot even on the lowest setting.",0
I have used this once and my nail polish definitely lasted longer.,1
Love it! Makes a great gift. If you've never tried Marvis toothpaste you MUST buy this.,1
Too many coats have to be applied to get the color. I was disappointed when I had to keep reappling. Polish is very thin.,0
"I haven't been using this long enough to know if Ill experience new growth and thicker locks. That being said, Ive ised it for a week now and my hair is extremely dry and brittle now because of this shampoo and conditioner. Im experiencing more breakage than I had before and my hair looks like poop.
I have tried using Argan oil while my hair is still damp and it still isn't moisturizing enough, when usually a touch of oil would leave my hair nice and smooth.
I bought this because the price point is nice, but Ill be returning it to splurge on the luxury shampoo I was trying to convince myself not to buy.",0
I ordered the 8.5 ozs. I received the 6.5 ozs. I am very dissatisfied with my purchase. I will not purchase again.,0
It was as expected. Arrived quicker than projected.,1
"I have used this product before and it works! However this particular company sent it to me and it ran out before 3 months. Maybe 2 weeks and I didn't use it more than I have in the past. I should get a refund, bc it didn't last as long as it should have.",0
My wife swears by it.,1
Really dried the skin in the areas I used it and created redness.,0
"Excellent product, perfect. Thank you guys.",1
so far I am really loving this eye cream.  I haven't had it long enough to say it is holy grail... but I do notice some changes in my fines lines since I've started using it the past 3-4 weeks.,1
"In college I worked at a spa as a receptionist which sold Pevonia. I was talked into trying it due to some acne issues I had. Well the products were amazing and I was able to get them back then at a discount. In my 20s I was using their eye creams and gels as a preventative measure as well. But as life went on I couldn't find a spa near me that carried Pevonia and I actually then had some minor acne issues and relied on my dermatologist completely forgetting about pevonia... UNTIL NOW! I stumbled upon it after looking for some way too expensive brands at the higher end department stores, which a) broke me out b) didn't do anything and c) one brand actually burned the skin around my eye. So I remembered about Pevonia as I was searching on amazon and thought I would give it a try again. O-M-G I saw results immediately. I have been using morning and evening.. the skin around my eyes looks smooth, brighter, plumper (not puffy), younger looking! I am in my 30s and promise to never ""forget"" about pevonia again! In fact I just ordered a their age defying moisturizer. I am now hooked for life. Since i have tried their other products I really think this entire brand is a hidden gem that everyone should try, especially if you are like me and want to do whatever possible to slow the aging process of wrinkles as much as I can.",1
"I love this scent, I'm so happy to layer the body oil with the perfume.
The candle smells great, I just wish it was bigger so it would last longer.",1
"Yes, this is easier to get on and off, but if I have to re-do the manicure every couple of days because of the edges wearing or chipping, it's not worth it. I'd rather deal with the gel polish and at least know that when I'm done I'm done for 2 weeks or more.",0
"I'm really at a loss here. Its just not good. I wet it, and went to remove my makeup and hardly any makeup came off on the cloth. My eye makeup was still firmly in place and hardly smudged at all. I did use very light pressure on my eyes and firmer presser on the rest of my face, but even then, the amount of makeup on the cloth after ""removing"" my makeup was so minimal I was just frustrated. Ive tried again several other times with very similar results. I don't get the hype for this whatsoever.",0
I bought it because I heard it makes good setting spray but some one lied. I've tried using it under my makeup I tried using it on top of my makeup but I don't like the way it makes it look.,0
"a great over all body lotion- a little expensive, but it has a really nice smell which is not overwhelming.",1
"This is definitely a fall scent. I like it a lot , very warm vanilla not so much fruity. I recommend this for anybody's collection.",1
"This gave me blackheads and made me breakout big time, and the smell is pretty gross. I sort of expect to initially breakout when I switch creams, but it didn't get better with time.
I did not notice improvement in my reddened skin with 2 weeks of use, but at that point I couldn't stand the breakouts and smell and had to get rid of it.
Also, word to the wise, do not get this near your mouth or you will have a terrible perfume taste in your mouth for a long time.",0
This is the worse hair dryer I have ever had...very heavy & was broken when I got it...stuff was rolling around in it!,0
"The cartridge, the number of pulse were less than 200 and after two times use, it did not work.",0
"I believe in general you get what you pay for, but with this, that was not true. It mousturizes, it cleans off makeup, but for dissolving ""clogs"" I'd say no. I have oily, black head ridden skin and I need a product to do what  this one says it does. oh well, back to tried and true Clean and Clear. its a good product just not worth twenty something dollars good.",0
"I used this three step program with ""Guaranteed Results"" and pretty much a month later - nothing. Going to try Nioxen.",0
"I really like this nail polish.  All Essie colors are amazing.  This one lasted a long time.  However, when I purchased it, I thought it was a dark pink.  It goes on a very dark red.  I love the color, but it was not what I was looking for.  If you are looking for a dark pink, don't choose this one.  If you are looking for a burgandy, I definitely recommend it!",1
"This cream was either expired or a different cream mixed with transformation cream. It had a similar smell, and the date on the package was current. However, it did NOT apply the same as the one I get from my doc. It was thicker and white when applied, and the usual ones I get are translucent when rubbed into the skin. This one took a while to absorb. Something's fishy...",0
Good enough!,1
Works for my skin in combination with other skin care.,1
One day after using it my hair broke at the crown. I don't know if this is a  fake product or not but If I could give 0 stars I would.,0
"I've gone through 2 tubs of proraso green (1 old formula and 1 new formula), and 1 tub of proraso red soaps in addition to a few tubes of their creams.  I've always loved the proraso soaps until I got this most recent tub.  When it showed up it was leaking out the sides of the tub and the soap itself is as soft as their cream products.  I am very familiar with Italian style ""soft soaps"" but this is nowhere near as firm as my last 3 tubs of proraso soap.  This product is soft I can hold the tub upside down and it will fall out.  I've only used it 4 times and almost half of the tub is gone already because my (very soft synthetic omega) brush will scoop out huge chunks and push out huge globs from the side.  I'm not sure what is up here, maybe a bad batch, but I've never had proraso soap respond this way.  It almost looks and acts like someone squirted a tube of cream into a bowl and resold it.",0
"This sunscrean is easy to spread on the skin, does not feel greasy, and really protects.",1
"Pathetic would be a very small word. It smells sweaty as soon as you put in. Its not the original product its just a imitation copy, waste of Money, as I have used it once, I cannot return it, else I could have returned it the very moment.",0
I have several product from BABYLISS and have been very happy with them. For the most part I like this curling iron the only thing I wasn't happy with was the cord. Sounds trivial but it's the cheaper thin cord plus it doesn't swivel freely like most so it gets tangled up when curling your hair. I have very fine hair and I haven't noticed any breakage at all plus it heats up very fast. There's a lot of options on the settings which works great for my fine hair. Overall I think Babyliss products are great.,1
"I really don't like this, one of those wasted buys, not happy. the colour gives me this funny look, i really don't like this.",0
"I was so excited to get this and I love it.  My cousin told me about foreo and i already love their cleansers so I broke down and decided to try this.  OMG its great!! It leaves my face super soft and it looks so much brighter and healthier after I add my serums.  I also use this w the serum so that it massages it in my face and i get better application.  The oil feels really nice, but I haven't used the boscia cleanser or the face mask yet. This is not a fake product like someone said in one of the reviews because the warranty worked for me.  I would recommend this to a friend because it does feel like a spa treatment.  If your going to spend the same amount of money for a clairisonic I would say forget that and go with the luna instead.  Its the same price, better for the skin since its not harsh and breaks veins and capillaries on face, and much more hygenic than a brush that you have to switch out every so often.",1
Do not like the scent!  Used only once then pitched it.,0
"Nice sheer polish.  It does give your nails a healthy glow as I saw on the ""TODAY"" show.  I hold back on the 5th star because I had to use so many layers to get he desired look. Low fumes too.",1
"Love this conditioner!
Great price!",1
"I have 3 hot tools curling irons. 2 work wonderfully. The one I'm reviewing was purchased in the beginning of April 2016 and quit working June 16, 2016!",0
"Lasted less than 3 months.
Horrible investment.",0
I was pretty disappointed in this mascara. I wasn't able to get good coverage and I feel like it did nothing to enhance my lashes.,0
Makes my hair super dry and the smell isn't really great,0
This product is good to make hair looks thicker but it does not work on areas with a very little hair because you gonna see a brown spots on the scalp which does not look good at all.,0
"i just got, just open it.
the product was damaged, it looked like its crashed, not only the outside, and the tooth path!!!!!!!",0
I like the way it hydrates my skin..but it breaks me out something terrible.,0
Color is true to the posted web page. Received earlier than expected. Wears like iron.,1
"TERRIBLE if you have dry skin and it's the complete opposite of what it's described to be. I have very pale skin and I ordered the linen because when I do wear makeup I notice that the lightest ivory is still too orangey for me. This, however, made me look sallow. It was YELLOW and VERY  CAKEY and so difficult to remove that it took well over 30 mins and was physically painful, I'm not kidding. You practically need sandpaper to get this off. It is the worst makeup I've ever tried and exacerbated my flushing. Cheap drugstore brands are WAY better. Maybe this works well for someone with very very oily skin and if they can actually find the right color. But it's actually more cakey than any other makeup I've ever tried. My face did not look severely cracked until I put this on. What a total waste of money. Plus it showed up a day late despite my 2-day order and I got all these messages claiming that I changed the shipment date (?!? I did NOT) and that I wasn't home when a couple delivery attempts were made. NOT TRUE. No note was even left for me to prove that. And I did not request a package I had to sign for. I absolutely hate that and I don't see any indication anywhere that I flubbed up and ordered it so as to be delivered that way. (Maybe it's their policy, which I'd personally view as another major flaw.) Instead, I had to get it from a ups store I've never even been to and my car was broken so I had to ask an extremely busy and inconvenienced relative to pick it up for me, only to be horribly disappointed in the end. But if it did work, I missed the deadline for its arrival anyway. I really needed it to be 2-day shipping. I'm not bothering with makeup now (partly to help heal the damage this junk did to me) and I feel better for it.",0
"I bought this just over a year ago and the cartridge is already out. I only used it three times in the whole year (it takes a long time to go through the hair removal process). Anyway, I expected this to work longer and not to mention I still have hair growing all over my legs.",0
I love this product.  I put very little on my hair after I have dried it.  It gives my white hair a beautiful shine.  I have received many compliments on my hair after applying this product.,1
"Light on the skin and makes your skin feel smooth too!
I bought this for a trip to the beach and it did the job! My face didn't get much darker and it didn't cause my skin to break out or anything!
Ill certainly buy it again",1
"Very nice dryer but after only one year, the dryer shuts off several times while drying hair.  I do want to return it but it says it's not eligible for return even though it has a two year warranty.  I do not have the box anymore to return and would like to know how to return this so I can purchase another hair dryer.  Thank you",0
Never had an OPI polish that chips and peels off the same day I put it on. This one does. I tried it twice. Once with base coat and once with out and both times it chipped off within hours of my doing my nails. Very strange.,0
"I don't think it's authentic. I tried this cologne at the store. And the one I bought here doesn't smell the same. When I tried it on the store, the smell of the cologne was in my arm the whole day. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm not sure it's authentic.",0
"This is my first butter polish and I'm just not that impressed. I LOVE the effect of this polish (the blue iridescence is so cool!) but the polish starts chipping around the sides of my nails after a couple of days. I'd expect longer wear, and the same thing happens with or without a top coat. It's just not worth the price!",0
"I received the hair dryer today. And it doesnt have that black accessory that completes the hair dryer.
Please let me know how I should proceed to received the part missing.
Thank you",0
I bought this because of good reviews. It functions as advertised. I was surprised how little is required to lather my face. It says to wait two minutes after applying before shaving. I did that...once. It gave a great shave. It was also hard to get out of the razor. I use an inexpensive canned shave gel from Walmart and it works as well as this and for less money.,1
"I've heard about this lotion for years and seen so many glowing reviews... I'm so disappointed. I didn't expect the lotion to do much for my cystic acne, maybe just improve it or shorten the time the cysts are visible, but this didn't even make a simple *non-cystic* whitehead go away! I'm glad it works for so many people but it just didn't help me. :(",0
"This thing is amazing! Thanks for the other reviews here since it helped me decide to choose this sponge for my mineral make up. I agree, I use far less makeup with this and my skin looks SO smooth. It really is all in the application.",1
"God! this stuff stinks.  I couldn't keep using it because the smell was so terrible, leaving my hair smelling ""dirty.""  What a waste of money and this stuff was very, very expensive!",0
This product does not work.  I tried it for over a month figuring because I had deep rooted whiteheads I needed more time with the product.  Ended going to a dermatologist.,0
"Agreed with another customer: DO NOT USE! This product smells awful (like a chemical kind of smell) and it clumps badly. Unlike other waterproof mascaras, it sticks so bad to your eyelashes that I almost thought I had lost mine after trying to remove this product. Terrible...",0
"I love Mizani products, but I don't know if something was wrong with this.  It smelled fine as I sprayed it on my hair, but once it dried, it smelled like mildew.  It was sooooo disgusting. I had to wash my hair again.  I gave it another try, just to make sure that's what it was, and yes, it was definitely from the product.  I've never had anything but good things to say about Mizani, so maybe this was just a fluke.",0
"I only used this twice 2 days apart. It make my face break out, turn blood red,get scally, burned it and made my eyes swell. I ended up going to the doctor . Obviously I stopped using this and she gave me a moisterizer for my face and an RX for drops for my eyes.
I returned the product.",0
"Doesn't get hot enough as described, but previous models work great.",1
This curling iron stopped working about a month ago.  I only use it periodically and it just stopped heating.  I have never had an item only last a couple of months.  It seems I have no return policy with amazon for this as it did last over 30 days.,0
Did nothing for my hair dryness & had the smell of cheap perfumed drugstore brand conditioners.,0
"Pricey, but I believe it's the best orange blossom fragrance available.  While it has other notes in it to round it out, it is strikingly orange blossom.  Other notes don't compete with it, such as the orange blossom seen in Serge Luten's fragrance or L'Artisan's Seville l'Aube.  It's an extremely feminine fragrance.  It is not a suffocating or sultry white floral.",1
The bottles were dented all over.,0
"I bought this product mainly because my daughter has fair, sensitive skin, which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation. This product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face, hands etc. It did not irritate her skin at all...the problem, the one and only problem, is the fragrance, if you can call it that. It stinks so bad, I did not want to go near her after I wiped her down...I had to give her a bath, it was so bad.",0
"I bought the green primer and it's perfect for my medium skin tone and helps neutralize reddish areas of my face. The powder goes on very smoothly after and stays on ALL Day. I started using the Pur Minerals primer and mineral powder about 6 months ago after using Bare Minerals for yearrrs and not only have I noticed a huge improvement in my complexion, I'm happier with the color match, the longevity and Pur makeup is less messy and greasy.",1
This does not seem right. The label is off and doesn't look like a legitimate product.,0
Love the product.  Just to orange for me.,0
"No stars for this product , it's 100 percent fake ,the brush is cheap and poor quality , don't buy this product ,waste of your money",0
"I have been buying this at a local store, but this was a better value and has lasted quite a long while.",1
prefer unscented products.  This one has a perfume that lingers,0
very good,1
I have used before  and don't look it the seems to me on real.,0
"I like it but I would not say that it makes my nail polish lash any longer than sally hansen from the drug store, on my nails it lasts a few days without the tops chipping, but I type a lot, I was expecting more after reading all of the other reviews.  plus I have tried it with VINYLUX nail polish and OPI nail polish with the same results",1
I thought it was a bigger size,0
Cheaply made. Very disappointed because the mitt fell apart after the first use. I have used other mitts that were much better quality for half the price. Would not recommend.,0
It works great on my long long hair. the ends aren't straw now! Love it and I can wait a few days between shampoo again.,1
"I posted a picture of my shellac red baroness pedicure. Looks great. This color matches the bottle, which isn't allways the case with shellac. Worth the higher price to have high-shine, no-chip, no dry-time, lasts for weeks color!",1
The shampoo is great and the shipping was super  quick!,1
Great iron for big loose curls. Heats up fast. Come with replacement springs as well. Love this brand,1
"It's on the heavy side of curling irons.  I like the titanium and doesn't catch my hair.  It has a temperature wheel on the side, so easy to get the right heat.  I don't understand those that burned their hair... turn down the temperature.

The tip is big enough that I don't burn my fingers when using.  I only straighten my curly bangs, but my old Conair burned my fingers too often.

I only give 4 stars due to it's weight.  I should have looked at weight on each of those I was comparing.",1
"So, this cream did absolutely nothing for me after at least two months of consistent use. It felt nice, but I saw no effects. I wish I did because it's fairly expensive.",0
"I was so excited to pick out my very first bottle of Butter 3-free nail polish. There were many gorgeous colors to choose from. I chose this one (Kerfuffle)...and I wish I hadn't. It didn't go on very nicely. It was obvious I couldn't even possibly get by temporarily with one coat. But mostly it reminds me of a colored ""White-Out"" I used years ago at my job. Every time I look down at my toes, I cringe because it's obvious I won't be happy until I remove it and put something else on.

I would be willing to try another color by this brand, but I can't recommend this one.",0
"makes your hands feel like satin, and the scent is fantastic.  Would recommend this product.",1
Doesn't really work.  Would not recommend.,0
Didn't make my hair look thicker. Did cover up the part in my hair somewhat.,0
nice color doesnt plump much,0
"I have three strikes against me: I color my hair, there's a lot of gray and I live in Florida w/a constant struggle for smooth hair.  This conditioner is the ONLY product that works for me--I use it daily--and can keep smooth, shiny hair all summer long.  And, the color is protected.

Hated the price but the result of 'nice' hair is worth paying, gulp, $100 for a hair conditioner.

An additional note:  The price has risen an additional $40!!  Wow.  No.  And...more bad news...the product is more liquid and watered down.  It matches the price at my salon which is 10 minutes from my home.  (p.s.  Bought a bottle directly from Pureology and paid the $120+.  Thick and back to normal.  Have no idea what was cloned in my last purchase of expensive product from Amazon.  Creepy!)",0
"It's supposed to glide on, it doesn't it drags across your skin. Supposed to be purple but just looks brown when it's on. Very disappointing",0
I wish there was a way to rate the product separate from the seller..Great product but *way* too expensive here. Buy it directly from Toppik.,0
"I have really bad dandruff and must use a medical shampoo every 3 days to control it. It strips my hair a lot, dulling and thinning it. I dislike after shower hair products and gels, so this was recommended to me as an alternative.

It works great. I've noticed massive improvements in the quality of my hair, both thickness, softness, and shine, when I use it directly after a shampoo and the day after (no shampoo). In fact, the two subsequent ""conditioner only"" days I have before another shampooing leave my hair less thinned otu from another shampoo than would be standard.

I'd go with this over the standard tea-tree if you need to shampoo often. That is, unless, you dislike lemony smells that don't persist after rinsing.",1
Smells amazing but not worth the price - I didn't find that it worked any better than the $3 Suave dry shampoo.,0
The deodorant doesn't last very long. It smells ok. It is over price because the brand. I don't recommend it.,0
I returned this,1
I broke out two of the three times I used it but still like it.,0
This product is very nice for my hair. I have very dry and brittle hair and it help make it feel healthier.,1
Good for in between hair coloring.  Works really well for me.,1
"Does not leave my skin dry, itchy or irritable. It only clears it. I would definitely recommend.",1
According to their advertising I expected an all natural ingredient nail strengthener. You can smell the chemicals just like any other polish. It hardens okay but wears off like any other polish would. I work with my hands and needed protection. My nails still chipped and split even with this product on. It's so not worth the money spent. I could have gotten something at Wal-Mart for five dollars and it would have been the same difference.,0
I have tried MANY lip moisturizers and Jack Black is the only product that truly keeps my lips from dry and flaky.,1
This flat iron works pretty well for my thick hair. It has many heat settings and it heats up quick. My only complaint is that it doesn't have an automatic shut off.,1
"use a comb, this is silly.",0
"I was hoping this product would help me with my sun damage, but unfortunately I didn't see any difference in my face after using it for 2 months. I ended up going to a cosmetic dermatologist and getting a prescription.",0
fabulous,1
I need my money back!!,0
This product completely stopped working less than 6 months after purchase.,0
"Received damaged and not eligible for return because its "" flammable"". If i could give this -5 stars i would.",0
"This seems like a great, refreshing toner. It disperses nicely from the spray bottle and it feels good going on my skin. A few spritzes go a long way. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moist after application. It has a rather unique fragrance, not unpleasant and not great neither. Fortunately for me, it doesn't linger. The toner is supposed to help refine and improve skin appearance due to aging. However, the jury is still out. I haven't seen any noticeable improvement yet. At any rate, I'll continue to use it since I like how refreshing it is. Other than the so-so scent, it's worth a try.",1
I got this is in the color Latte but should have probably gotten it in Mocha because it looked slightly gray on my skin. My skin did appear smoother but I wish it adhered better because it easily rubbed off on other things. I felt uncomfortable wearing makeup on my entire body.,0
I really like this product and it's great to use  to use between shampoos to get fly a way hair back in shape.,1
"BEWARE, I bought this to replace on that I lost. This was the wrong color.  I have bought this color in the past and this was not it.",0
"Doesn't have enough adjustment on the low end. I put mine on the lowest side of ""1"" and wish i could adjust it more. To the least aggressive side.
Glad i got the chrome and not satin finish. I was worried about slipping in the hand. Theres none of that. Wipes clean easily.",1
Love it,1
Leaves all greasy....sheesh,0
"This product was shipped to me in a couple of days, faster than expected.  Really great scent.  I bought the small size (2.5 oz)  because you should only need to apply a dab of it.  At this rate of use, the bottle may last a couple of years.",1
"I was so upset with this product
I loved it when I received it , loved how it made my skin feel ...
Only this is if lasted less than 3 weeks and I only used one pump morning and one pump in evening I believe I was sold a product that was not full",0
Doubtful of authenticity think it's fake,0
"I've been using the Glycolix pads for over a month now. I have yet to see any difference at all in my skin tone or texture. I was so hoping these would give my middle aged skin a boost of radiance, but nothing. I am super disappointed.",0
"Have one that looks identical, but not the same color",0
Bad bad bad not good for beauty salon.,0
"this is a great product which I like but the one I received was very old, so old it was dark in color.  steer clear of this vendor...",0
"I heard RAVE reviews about this mascara, so I was super excited to try it. I'm sorry to report that I was very disappointed. It has a very strong smell, makes my lashes clump and feel heavy, and is very wet. It's not the worst, but I've had many drugstore mascaras that were much better. By paying more I thought I'd be getting better quality.",0
"First off, let me say, this is the first flat iron that I have bought for myself. However, I previously owned another ceramic flat iron that my mother bought for me in high school. My old one was 2"" and had this weird X design, so when it broke, I really wanted to get a replacement that would work much better for my hair type (I have almost waist-length 3c to 4b hair which is super thick, course and dense).
I researched flat irons for about 6 months (yes a helluva long time) and saw that this was the most and best recommended one from persons with ALL hair types. I bought it through Amazon when the price was $99.95 (I stalked it until the price dropped).
When  I first received it I thought it was incredibly light, so light, that I was a bit worried that it was inferior quality, but when I turned it on, OH BOY. It heats up really fast and really hot. My hair glided through the plates so easily! And because the outside of the iron, adjacent to the plates also heats up, it was great for curling as well. The grip is great, the swivel cord makes it heavenly to use, and that long cord is AMAZING.

I saw some comments about the gap between the plates, but it has not been a problem to me at all since I have thick hair. I did use it on a friend of mine's hair that is much finer and it was no problem either, so I'm not sure what the complaints were about. All you have to do is press on it a little harder.
This flat iron is just a joy to use, its quick, easy... amazing really. So glad I purchased it (even though it's a bit pricey)",1
I ordered the curl shampoo two times and received a different product both times.  I love this brand but I would like to receive the product I ordered,0
"This iron is a bit on the heavy side and snagged and pulled my hair and left it dry dull and lifeless, i actually had parts that looked burnt and crumbled to the touch and i was not even to the extremely hot setting  , this is just a metal barrel the gold blah blah is non sense,  i have a paul mitchell straightner which is soo smooth and adds shine to my hair probably i ll try the curling iron from same brand.",0
I use this at night and an off brand salycic face wash in the morning and seems to be working very well for me,1
Seems to do the job but it stinks like an older ladys perfume,1
"I have acne prone skin, and I don't know if it's the LHA or what but sometimes it makes me breakout a little bit. I think it's because it must be cleaning the impurities. What I wanted to make a note on is this product really reduced the size of my pores! Not that they were huge but they were a little bigger than I liked. Within a couple days, yes...a couple, the pores on my cheeks had reduced significantly. It was pretty amazing, I'm really happy about that. Now if only I could find a product that actually works on acne scars.",1
.*'*`*. ULTRA LIQUIDY  \*/  DOES NOT STAY ON SKIN \*/ DRIPS DOWN FACE EVEN AFTER SHAKING \*/  TOTAL SEPARATION OF FLUID .*'*`*.,0
"I've been using this product for a couple of years, at bedtime. I'm 55 years old and have great skin. Try it!",1
Doesn't streak and provides great coverage. Doesn't have a weird smell. I wear almost daily.,1
Not the same product...They have changed the formulation.  I don't like it at all and think its quite overpriced for what it does/doesn't do.,0
Loved the product when I bought the smaller bottle from Sephora. Was a bit concerned there was no safety seal but seller says it came without... Seems okay...,1
My hair stylist uses this product and now I see how she gets my hair so silky! It really is a GREAT hair dryer.,1
I bought 2 of these and they are both dried up. I discovered it's because they both expired over a year ago in 05/2016,0
I have sensitive skin and It gave me allergic reactions like red flare ups and It smells too strong for me.,0
"My friend asked me to buy it online for her, it arrived well and she is still loving the smell. But not my style, a bit to strong like al of Hugo Boss perfume.",1
Great Product and service,1
It doesnt seem to get as hot as I had hoped! I have long thick hair and bought this with the hopes that the higher temperatures would help to make the curls hold. It unfortunately doesnt do it as well as I was hoping for.,1
It is my wife's favorite polish and hard to find. Our shipment was quick and delivered correctly.,1
What products that were in my box (I only received 8 items) impressed me even though they were only things you could use only one time..,1
Great stuff,1
"I bought this product once before and loved it but this one smells different, and seems to be more like a  hair dentangle spray  then a leave in conditioner.",0
The La Roche Foaming Gel emerges from the tube as a clear liquid.  I have rubbed it on my skin once a day before showering.  I find  that it does clean my skin with no adverse effects.  I intend to continue to use it.,1
Too dark for me but I love OPI,1
"Bought this razor because It had such great reviews, it was my first time trying a safety razor so I watched a video to make sure that I didn't hurt myself. It didn't matter, the shave was terrible and left my face burning for 48 hours after. I even went to the art of shaving to try some of their pre and post shave supplies, that didn't help either. The only reason I'm giving this razor two stars is because it really did give me a very close shave. I was really bummed that I paid $35 for this razor and will never use it again.",0
"I love almost every Supergoop product.  This one has a pleasant citrus scent, so not your average sunscreen smell.  It's easy to apply and it workS.  I was able to get my back, no butt and still a bit of color.",1
"Didn't love the stuff.  While a little goes a long way, the product itself is thin, a little slimy feeling and does not lather.  I don't know if that's the trick, but my face didn't feel particularly clean when I was done washing my face.  It worked well, I guess, but I didn't care for the way it felt and will not recommend or order again.",0
No es del tamao deseado,0
The consistency is too thin.,0
OK,1
A couple years ago I ordered this product and it worked great but I feel like it was in a white container with green letter. The packaging is not the same and the strength is not the same either. I paid 20 some dollars and it does nothing !! The pads are not soaked so you pull one out they are really very thin and they are mostly dry. Not even close to what I had before .,0
made my under eye dry and noticed after a month creases.,0
"I have used this shampoo for about 2 months and I love it. I have salt/pepper hair, more salt than pepper. It keeps the yellow out and the smell is wonderful. I DO NOT use this everyday as my hair stays clean longer. I wash my hair 2, sometimes 3x weekly. I also purchased  Aveda Blue Malva Conditioner and together these products work great!",1
"I don't understand the hype of this item. The shampoo is more like a detergent, has great lather and stripped the color in my hair. I did not notice a tropical scent. The products packaging is cheap too. I am not happy i paid $22 dollars for this, won't happen again. I don't mind paying for luxury , this doesn't come close to luxury..",0
"I've been experiencing hair loss for the past 29 years. I am not bald, but very thin over most of my scalp. I tried the laser comb and followed the instructions faithfully for 6 months. The results are that my biceps certainly got. A workout with all that brushing, but I can honestly say that my hair is THINNER NOW than before the purchase/use of the laser comb......save yourself some serious money and get your remaining hair styled / cut properly by a good hairstylist. Your money will be better spent at the gym.",0
"This was a great hairdryer for the first 8 months then started making a buzzing sound and stopped working.  I'm trying to figure out how I go about returning this item for a replacement or refund but since I've had it for longer than 6 months it appears I cannot return it, despite the 3 year limited manufacturer warranty.  The Amazon site makes returning broken items very difficult/impossible.",0
I love the light feel and lack of sunblock smell!,1
I color my hair and it's extremely fine. This product helps immensely to get the comb through without breaking more hair than necessary.,1
"This is Berlin, there done that. Frustrated that the reviews for all the colors are lumped together.  I am attaching a photo with this polish shown with 2 accent nails on middle and ring finger. This is a great polish but I prefer more of a pinkish nude called Passion for everyday ""go-to"" polish. The Passion is much more forgiving for errors since it is lighter too.  This is definitely a nice change and I will wear it often. I can see it going well with both casual and business casual. It is a nice, becoming shade that would work with any skin tone.",1
One cap would not come off,0
the wife loves it,1
This is not what I was looking for. Contacted the seller for a refund and had no problem with the request. Although it states it will not leave your hair feeling heavy...it was quite the contrary. My hair felt sticky...dry...and I believe it dried my scalp. I love the Ouidad gel. Have been using it for years but this leave in conditioner is not for me.,0
"Unfortunately I'm allergic...
I'm sure it works great for other people.
Sorry, for the review.",0
"Since I begun caring for my hair on my own 3 years ago, I have only ever used this product to relax my hair. I have relaxed 3 times a year or every 4 months/17 weeks for the past three years. I used Index 2 twice in that time, but I have found that I like Index 1 better because it leaves my hair with just the right amount of texture. I don't prefer a bone straight look to my hair, and most people assume my hair is natural, which is the look I am going for. This product helps me achieve a looser texture while not totally straightening my hair. BTW, I have long (bra strap length) 4a texture hair. Another thing that I like about this product is that it allows me plenty of time for application and smoothing while still not fully processing my hair. I diverge from the instructions quite a bit and have found this to work for me. For instance, I leave this product on a total of 29 minutes instead of 20 as per the directions. My reasoning is this: I don't have fine or thin hair (20 minutes processing time), Index 2 allows 25 minutes, for coarse textures, using Index 1 (which is weaker than Index 2) allows more processing time. I'll be honest and say, again, that even with 29 minutes processing my time, my hair is no where near straight. Also, I am not necessarily recommending this, since everyone's hair is different, Just stating what works for me :)

However, this product is not without a few flaws. My main complaint is that it leaves little white flecks in my hair no matter how vigorously or how long I wash. I spend 45 minutes neutralizing my hair and that's not including my deep condition and I will still have white flecks in my hair each time I relax. At first I panicked thinking this was relaxer left on my hair, but after frequent use of this product I have learned that it's not, or at least not active relaxer, and it does not harm my hair. I also don't like how this product comes with 2 applications because I can never use it as such since I always have a ton of new growth and half the container will not be enough. So I end up wasting a lot of product. Would be much easier if they just sold one application sized jars and at a lesser cost. Also I am not a fan of the conditioner. I used to use it faithfully just because it came with the relaxer and so I felt it was formulated to work best with it, but now I use Kerastase conditioner and it leaves my hair much softer. The conditioner that comes with the relaxer tends to leave my hair pretty hard. Also, there is definitely not enough conditioner for 2 relaxer applications, and I find that it doesn't give me enough for even one relaxer session (but my hair is fairly long and relatively thick).

All of that said, I absolutely love this relaxer despite it's shortcomings and I will never ever switch. Is this relaxer worth the steep price? In my estimation, yes! It keeps my hair in it's healthiest state. My hair is not flat or limp following a relaxer, and my hair retains most of it's strength. Keep in mind that this is still a relaxer like any other, though it claims to be more natural. It smells like good ole fashion perm. But I have never had any issues with scalp irritation even though I leave it on longer than the recommended time. Might I add, that I like following up neutralizing with Roux PC which makes my hair instantly softer.",1
Great product!,1
I don't recommend this item.  Abulta mucho el cabello.,0
"I like the delivery system, comes in a small, easy-to-use bottle and dispensing product is easy without making a mess.
My only concern is that it took way more than the recommended amt. of product to thin my nail lacquer so that it would spread easily on my nails.  This may differ from person to person; however, this was just my personal experience.",1
This mitt only lasted 3 applications.,0
"I bought directly from the Juice Organics website.  Very moisturizing, not really a cleansing or for removing make up well.  I would use caution when using this.  It contains the dangerous form of Vit C in it, Ascorbyl Palmitate.  Hopefully they will change their formulation.  [...]",0
This stuff works great on roots!  It covers well and looks really natural!  It helps lengthen time between colorings!,1
Excellent!!!,1
"Good product, A+++",1
This dryer worked wonderfully for about 6 weeks and then shorted out on me while in-use. Sparks flew out of the plug!!! I am very disappointed as I expected a much longer lifetime out of a hair dryer priced at this value. Would not recommend purchasing.,0
Does not hold.  May work for others.,0
"This product does not do what it says.  I wasn't expecting miracles, but I was expecting the product to be what it says.  Very disappointed.  Would not recommend anyone to purchase products from this company.",0
"Didn't do a thing for me. I bought it for $14, now it's twice as much... not worth the price.",0
"It's okay, not really worth the price point. It's not actually a serum, it smells and looks like sunscreen. It doesn't make my skin look any younger and goes on like a drug store moisturizer, seems to clog pores a little too. I have not gotten sun burn while I've worn this product though.",0
"Smells like a cross between Tommy and Polo Blue, with more influence of Polo Blue.

But it is half of the price of the Polo Blue.

As an extra benefit, the ladies will notice.",1
"This product is gentle but removes all my eye makeup.  I've used other products, but they didn't remove all my eye makeup.  Other products also irritated my eyes, but this product does not irritate my eyes.",1
Excellent!,1
"After a short time of using, the holes seem to be half blocked, which makes spraying not as even as before.",0
I enjoy using this product and does a great job.,0
"I think I originally rated this product well, but soon discovered how watered down it is.  Ick.",0
"I really miss the ""Prom Queen"" color that Stainiac used to come in. I used it on my cheeks for YEARS!

This ""Beauty Queen"" is really dark, certainly not as subtle or natural looking.

theBalm, please bring back ""Prom Queen!""",0
"I gave this product 2 stars just in case the problem was my hair and not the product.  In the past I always had the aerosol version of Klorane Dry Shampoo in my hair care arsenal and it worked great but decided to give the non-aerosol a try because it was less expensive and was supposed to contain more applications.  It is a bit clumsy to use, for me, and left my hair feeling heavy and a bit gummy.  I have very fine, short blonde hair and it made my hair seem darker and dirtier and not in a good way.  I won't be purchasing the product in this form again.",0
"If you have pale skin, then this is going to be way too dark for you.  I have to mix this with white in order to even get it to come close to my skin tone.  It also smells a bit weird.  I won't be buying this again, still on the hunt for a shade of foundation that I don't have to mix with white.  It also is kind of patchy, probably because I have to mix it and the formula I mix it with is not as thick as this.  I use a beauty blender to apply my foundation, I can't imagine someone trying to use a brush with this, it would be streaky.",0
I do not like shaving first,0
"I got this curling iron because I have been reading good things about ""ionic"" technology and that it is better for your hair but I really don't think it's true. This curling iron does not curl my hair very well and when I put it on the 450 degree setting, it burned my hair. It does not create a shiny curl like it claims to. I am going back to my $13 Conair.",0
"Rated as a professional iron, but, the iron does not reach the temperature of professional grade.  It does not get hot enough for thick hair with natural curl.",0
"First time I bought this I loved it. I don't know if the formula changed or what, but my this time it burned my scalp. No good!",0
"I use this every night. My skin was so dry from using trintonin creme this winter. It has helped tremendously, my skin looks so much better.",1
Just bought a second one of these to have in my vehicle.  Beautiful Mason Pearson quality.,1
"Bottle was only 3/4 full... I paid for 32oz. and only received 24oz. The shampoo also looks grainy and clumpy, not smooth and creamy like the first bottle I purchased 6 months ago from a salon... almost like they mixed it with something so it took on a different texture.",0
"This is the only wax I've ever used personally that did not hurt or cause me to breakout. The smell is a little off-putting, but otherwise, it's a super easy wax to use. I did cut up my ingrown wipe to use multiple times, not sure why more wasn't included.",1
"Sadly, like other reviewers have stated, this eyeshadow had dried out completely, and fell out of its pot in a hard block. It is completely unusable both as a creme mousse and as a powder eyeshadow, as the drying process has solidified it like clay, making it impossible to even crumble powder from it. I'm guessing the company is sending old stock without checking if the product is still usable beforehand. It looks like a lovely product on Lisa Eldridge's tutorials, so if you can get one which isn't dried out, then great.",0
"This is an essence that my wife loves.  Indeed, I also think that the scent associated with this product is wonderful.  I can only go along with my partner's judgment that this is a terrific perfume, with a most pleasing result in its use.

My annual Christmas gift and birthday gift to my partner. . . .",1
Doesn't small like the one I bought from the store,0
"My wife has used this new dryer a few times and reports it's not quite as efficient as her old Conair dryer. After all the positive reviews, I was expecting a better result.",0
Balm is what better than cream even for full body application. The results are amazing,1
"I love OPI's colors as far as the polishes are concerned.  However, the durability factor of this product is just the worst.  I know people have said this product is just awesome, but take it from a teacher who subjects her hands to chalk 185 days a year; it just doesn't hold up.  For the price I paid, it didn't hold up well and was unfortunately not worth the money.",0
Beware this product is not real. The packaging was the first thing that  gave it away. Have the name of the shampoo on a sticker and another sticker on the side saying free shampoo. I've use this product for years I know the consistency and the smell this stuff is fake,0
June 2016. This product is NOT 4 ounces as stated. Is only 3.75.  Can tell from the smell that it is not the same as the one that I am currently using. Also the label is different (in fairness that could have changed). I am very afraid to use this on my hair not knowing if this is a counterfeit product or what is going on. Very disappointed that I paid for a description that clearly states 4 ounces!,0
too expensive. The 4 bottles almost the same fragance .,0
This is a good eyeliner.,1
"Since I have only one other razor to compare it to I can't warrant 5 stars, but this thing is pretty sweet.  Had now for a few months, easy to clean, disassemble and use.  Hasn't shown any rusting yet and I never dry it after use (like you're supposed to).",1
"Much better than the sticky mascara type root cover ups.  Color wow is easier to use, has great coverage and lasts.",1
Buyer Beware! This product made my hair fall out in chunks. I would use this cra on my dog!,0
It leaves residue and I don't think it helps make my hair any softer. It actually makes it more tangled when brushing. ,0
"I thought this would be a fun color, but it was gloppy and did not go on my nails well. I would not get this color again.  Sorry.",0
Item is just as expected.,1
Gets on your hands,0
good quality,1
This product works great for after a deep facial peel.,1
"I normally buy $20 dryers, but after my last one died, I decided to upgrade.  I hate spending a long time getting ready in the morning, so I was looking for a blow dryer with some oomph.  I love how fast this dryer works and my hair feels fabulous.  I would recommend this blow dryer to my friends.",1
Fake product! Definitely not tea tree!! Buyer beware!,0
"At first I liked it, but just recently it started to make a really loud annoying noise. I have warranty as well, but I seem to not be able to get into contact with the seller sadly.",0
little hard to use at first because I was not used to having a flat iron so skinny. I have got used to using it now and I like it.,1
"Love this face scrub. I like the feel the of the fine bamboo powder and can see a big difference in the number of blackheads on my face. Really strong cooling sensation after using, feels great",1
"I have been using this product for the last 6 years and I know for a fact that the product that I recently received was not the same product I've been using and loved. At a glance, the original Glytone bottle comes with a screw on cap. The one I received came with a pump. Another thing I noticed was that the ingredients on the product were different from the original product. I have sensitive skin so I did not want to try to open the product to see if my skin had the same good reaction to this product. Luckily I read the reviews below and noticed that I was not the only one who got a dupe.

**Product Update Jan 2018
I've been using this since my last review (~2 months ago) and despite the change of packaging, I can happily verify that they made no comprises around the effectiveness of this product. For the most part, it still keeps my skin clean and acne free. :) The only con that I will mention is that this new formula makes the skin around my mouth noticeably dry and flaky :(",1
Could not tell any difference in nail strength.,0
Excellent Coverage. Lasts all day. I put it to cover hyperpigmentation.,1
Not bad to expensive,0
"It's suitable for your morning fragrance. I really love this. However it's will be fast faded, you will need to apply it gradually throughout the day.",1
Very Disappointing,0
I never discussed this product with my hair stylist but last time I saw him he said my hair was thicker and asked what I was using.  I feel like it does make my hair fuller.,1
"I bought this through Amazon - Prime.  This product is NOT the real deal.  I have been duped.  As a buyer of this product for nearly 10 years, I know the genuine article and this is not it.  Caution is warrented if you can't smell/try it first hand.",0
"Read lots of reviews and tips and according to the clarisonic website, some people experience acne flare ups after using but they recommend using it for 2 weeks and it should go away. Apparently it bring everything to the surface. It took closer to 3-4 weeks for my skin to clear up (got quite a bit of acne about a week after I started using. Although I do get acne, it's usually hormonal and I've managed to tame it over the last year or so but it was the worst it's been in a long time). I decided to hope for the best and continue using it even after no improvement in the acne situation after 2 weeks. Glad I did because my skin looks much better now. Even to the point where I will go out wearing just a touch of concealer if I need it. Keep with it. Also love that it's so small and rechargeable. I hate things with batteries that you need to replace.",1
Not as good as the Obagi C serum...,0
"Please don't waste your time or money. It doesn't last and the Satin sealer makes your nails look flat with no sheen.  PLUS the day my $25 product arrived, I got an e-mail from them promoting if I spent $25, I'd get 3 bottles for free - which ZOYA wouldn't honor since my order was old?? My polish is chipping - not worth the money at all!!  Buyer beware!",0
Works fairly well but not all day long.,1
"Works only with certain hair styles and depends on the thick or thinness of your hair at certain parts. It will kinda work if you have average to thick hair but if you have thin hair it just falls through and you end up with the color you chose on your scalp. They should have this in different sizes since everyone's hair size is different. I have concerns about the product that does fall on your scalp of which you can't see,since it could block the pores on your head and if you're taking propecia will this stifle the upcoming hairs you're trying to get back?

Overall it's good if your now starting to loose hair or maybe if you shave your head really low and use it. Some of those videos aren't showing the real  result of using the product,some people use couvre along with this,maybe that might work better.",0
"Not worth it, did nothing...",0
Does not seem as thick as the old kind in the metal tube but pretty good.,1
"Smells wonderful, doesnt turn your hair white but it is pricey!",1
"Gets skin clean, I  use with mia clarisonic, but can dry normal to dry skin sometimes",1
Awesome!!,1
"I really like this shampoo.. I feel it keeps the color from fading and gives my hair a nice shine.  But then again I do use a ton of other products on my hair ie. Moroccan il, Josie Maran oils etc to keep my hair nice and shiny.

I was a Pureology user but switch to this brand.. So far so good.. No complaints so far.  Already bought another shampoo and conditioner set in larger size.",1
"Fast delivery, I like this smell, it's like warm vanilla sugar. I smelled in on someone else and immediately feel in love.",1
"Calling this a weekly polish is a misstatement.  It definitely does not last a week.  While it dries quickly and has a nice shine to it, I can get my polish to only last a couple of days.  I will continue to use it because I bought it, but I am not sure that I would buy again.",0
"Onesta in Italian means honesty. Their advertising is anything but honest. This natural organic shampoo is neither natural or organic. The ingredients include PEG120, PEG150 & various sulfates etc. There is no certification on the bottle that says who certified the ""natural"" ingredients listed as organic. More importantly this shampoo de-volumizes. it made my hair very greasy and thin and took the curl out. Yuck!!! I would give it no stars if allowed. Don't waste your money.",0
Light but masculine clean smell,1
"I purchased this product about 2 weeks ago and noticed it was 135.00 verses the regular price of 185.00 and I guess that should have told me , too good to be true.

This is the second time I have bought Perricone products via Amazon's sellers verses through actual Perricone sellers. (authorized sellers). BOTH times Ive felt I have thrown away my money.

I will NEVER buy any Perricone products this way again.

I have purchased direct from Perricone and also from authorized resellers and have not been so dissapointed as I have the two times Ive bought through Amazon.

This product came, unsealed (which Perricone does NOT seal their products, which means anyone can add water to them) maybe that is why it was so much less expensive? Dont know but the Deep Wrinkle Serum I bought here has the consistency of water, and I have not noticed ANY difference even though it states immediate results...

I will never risk my money here again on Perricone, instead I will buy direct from Perricone. They have some good specials from time to time.",0
makes great lines and has the staying power I like.,1
I don't really see anything to love or hate about this product.  Its just meh.  I love all their other products so Im disappointed.,0
Nice coverage but tends to have a powdery finish.  The powdery finish dries out my skin.,1
"Smells like beer.  It did a good job and was a nice flexible hold but I stopped using it because my husband said, ""You smell like a stale old bar maid."" Yes, he used those exact words.",0
"I have a severe itch problem on my feet and ankles. This product feels non-greasy and feels a little cooling. Unlike other reviewers, mine has no scent. The size of the bottle means this will last for a long time.",1
I'm sure this would be great fresh but the tube I received was already past expiration and don't want to put it anywhere near my eyes. :-/,0
Love it!!!,1
"i bought this in advance of need, i now need it and it will not spray at all. it is my 2nd can, liked the 1st one.  how can i return this for a can that sprays?",0
Leaves a white ashen residue on my dark skin. Wish I had returned this product. I don't use it... probably give it to one of my white friends but they probably won't like it either,0
"Because of all the 5 star reviews, I bought OPI Nail Envy and applied it as directed.  My soft, thin, short nails started growing and now they are long and strong for the first time ever!  I am grateful so many people gave it 5 stars.  Without the ratings, I may never have found this amazing product.  It is a miracle.

Update 2 years later.  Down to 1 star!  I should have believed other recent reviews.  OPI changed the formula.  It is now diluted.  It doesn't form the same protective coating on my nails.  It just flakes off and my nails remain sof.",0
"It's fairly difficult to review something at this premium price point if the results are difficult to gauge.  What I can say is that after two weeks I see obvious results with smoother, more moisturized skin.

The cream absorbs readily, and smells nice,and also feels nice.  It's more substantial and more pleasant than many other lotions and moisturizers I've used, and seems to last longer after applied.

It's a premium product for sure, and you can tell it's different from a less expensive product, however it's more difficult to say if that difference justifies the price point.  But It definitely works.",1
I have been using this hair dryer for only 1 month and the motor is already blown.  Because I did not buy the product from a distributor I do not believe that there is a valid warranty.  Buyer beware.,0
Smells like really strong paint. Once you get the top coat on the smell goes away. It's a very pretty light grey with a hint of lavender. I get compliments every time I wear it.,1
Found the product was sticky and appeard to make my skin even more dry. Disappointing waste of money...,0
This product doesnt work well for my eczema prone skin. But the new La Roche-Posay Lipikar is working well. Id only use this product on my feet.,0
Item arrived on time and wss packaged well but I used it consistently for 2 months and did not notice any results (i purchased it to treat my 'strawberry legs'). The black dots are still there. It must have been doing something to my skin however because I did experience a tingling sensation when using it.,0
"This is not a color for brown skin girls (Kerry Washington, Nia Long)  It doesn't work as contour or a bronzer.  Just makes your face look dirty.
Not sure what completion this will work for but it surely is not for me.",0
Great for extending hair style while traveling.,1
"This cleanser is aimed at people who have acne, but it's a good, all-around facial cleanser for even those who don't have those issues. I appreciate the fact that it doesn't feel harsh (unlike some facial scrubs) and it doesn't dry out my skin. It has a smooth, gel-like consistency and once you add water, it foams up nicely.

My main caveat is that it's very expensive for such a small bottle. Fortunately you don't need to use a lot each time you wash your face, but given the many options out there, I would be more likely to buy this on a regular basis if the price point was lower.",1
"First let me explain. My hair has been slowly thinning all around for the past 2 years. It's mainly been thinning in the front.
I've tried Rogain for 2 years and yeah i'm not sure if that's even helping.

Through research and seeing what other people use to cover up balding i found out about toppik. Now the commercial made it look like you sprinkle on REAL HAIR. I'm a skeptic so I was never expecting that so the fact that it didn't look like the commercial didn't disappoint me. Oh yeah I also had to pay $20 bucks for an f'n spray pump thing. Why didn't that just come with the toppik to begin with? It'd be like buying windex without the spray cap and having to spend $20 so you could spray it. Totally reasonable right?

Ok when i first got the Toppik in the mail i sprayed a little on my arm to test it. Of course it doesn't look like real hair but surprisingly it looks really good. It's basically just black makeup but it blends really well and that's all i was expecting. So i applied it to the two balding spots in front of my hairline. And it looked AMAZING!
I was so happy! It really made it look just like i had all my hair back.
You can't comprehend how relieved i felt. I was so happy I figured wow i could just use this till i get ridiculously bald.
It was a dream come true.

What I did was apply the toppik before I went to work and then wash it off before bed.
So great right?
Troubles are over?

No -_-
At about the third day in I washed it out and noticed something weird. My hair was thinner than EVER!
I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me and i REFUSED to believe it.
Could the toppik be making me lose my hair? NO WAY! I researched this thoroughly and everyone said the same thing
toppik does not make you lose more hair.

To put my theory to the test I stopped applying toppik to the left part of my hairline but continued to use it on the right part of my hairline. The balding on the right side got way worse and the balding on the left stood the same.
Yes it's true toppik actually made me lose more hair. I would have been better off stealing some of my sisters makeup.
This product is complete BS and I HATE everyone involved with marketing this scam. I've now lost even more hair and even more depressed about it.
I seriously just wanted to aim at my bald spot and blow my brains out. I hate toppik and i hate everyone involved with marketing or selling it.",0
This is the size of a round eyes shadow container. It has a nice mirror in the lid. You really don't need much blush. I got Cotton candy. It's not too pink. It doesn't really shimmer. It's more like a fresh glow. It's going to be perfect for my business trips.,1
"We've always liked Mustela products and this is no exception.  Scents are always fresh and clean, but light.  Goes on easy, no residue or greasiness.  And never had an issue with skin irritation.",1
Clean and refreshing. It doesn't strip the skin of its natural oils.,1
This product does seem to improve my overall skin appearance. I will continue using especially because I previously didn't have a good skin care regimen.,1
"OMG I love this stuff!!!!!  I am very fair - pale actually and I wanted just a hint of natural looking color, a healthy glow really.  I wasn't sure what to expect from this.  I tried their dark tanning lotion and it came out a bit too dark on me and I wasn't sure what to expect with Phenomenal fair.  The directions recommend applying it three times for the longest tan, and so far I have only applied it once. The color came out absolutely amazing, exactly what I wanted.  I will apply it two more times as instructed to get the longest wear, will see if it actually lasts two weeks.  Even if it doesn't though the color is beautiful, and definitely worth the price I would say.  So natural.  No lines or streaks.  I am not sure however to exfoliate again before applying it.  I think that I might as this will most likely enable it to reach the deepest layers.  I think that I might be sold on this product!",1
"Love it, doesn't dry lips out.  Not too dark.  I just use a little clear lip
gloss over it and it stays on well.",1
"I just finished my 4th bottle. I'm not sure whether there's formula change or what. Somehow this lotion doesn't moisten skin as much as before. After few hours of applying it, my daughter's skin is dry as it was before bath. I won't continue using this lotion",0
"its ok, just ok",0
"This is the BEST flatiron I've ever owned! I have curls, waves and frizz, and if I didn't color it it would be all gray which tends to be coarser than my original color. My hair never looked better. I wanted to replace my old flatiron, and had asked my hairdresser for a recommendation. She said she liked the BaByliss Pro so I read the reviews & liked what I saw. It does a fabulous job in half the time of my old one, and my hair looks and feels soft & smooth. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone looking for a superior styling tool.",1
I use this product all the time and the last bottle I purchased the liquid turned brown.  I think this means it has gone bad or something.  Usually the liquid is clear.  The time for return is over so I am stuck with a product I cannot use.  An expensivie one.,1
Nice cleanser.  Gently cleans my skin.,1
"This lotion smells super good. It's a bit thick, so it's good for hydrating dry hands. The scent lasts for awhile too",1
DID NOT like this lotion at all.  It was very greasy and left residue on my face.  It was also a pain to return since it came from Mario Badescu and not Amazon.,0
Leaves my face feeling nice and refreshed every time I use it!,1
Returned it. Didn't see visible results after suggested use.,0
"Not a fan at all. Maybe I need more time, but today was wash number 5 (every other day). My hair felt like it could stand up on its own, there was so much buildup. And I rinsed with hot water and cold water for over 5 minutes! I I ended up re washing today with a mild, organic shampoo. I feel normal again!",0
Didn't realize it's for oily skin,0
Just buy Kiehl's version. It's MUCH better.,0
i recommend this product. it smells fabulous .the bottle is really kool its shaped like an apple.wonderful product. thank you!,1
As described,1
Great product!,1
"I had been using Cargo OneBase samples for a whileand as I've run outI wanted to try something different. Stila's tube is much smaller than expected (about 1/3 the size for a tube of Cargo you pay only $6 more for). Not their faultmore mine for not looking at the size.

While you get a lot less for the dollar, it seems to be a better deal. Like OneBase, a little of Stila goes a long way, but it *goes* on a lot thicker. It has an almost sticky consistency when first applied (if you are a tactile person this may be a turn off), but it doesn't stay sticky and has better coverage. It appears to stay on longer than OneBase, too. I also like the fact it didn't come with an applicator in the cap, but had a nice fine tip for squeezing a tiny bit out. This prevents the makeup from being contaminated by germs by continuously touching an applicator to your face and putting it back into the makeup. Like OneBase, it does not appear to cause my sensitive skin to break out and it does not appear to make creases stand out. So while this makeup is more expensive, it may be a better deal as less gets used every day.",1
"Vinylux is a great product. It doesn't always wear for a full week, but give my nails a real workout.",1
It dies not work with the led light and it dies not work well with other gel products. I'm sorry I purchased this,0
"I have bought twice from this site. One was in the regular compact  and two were not. I believe that the two were forgery  as the color was sl light and the material itself was drying.  I have since bought from the dermatologist at higher price and they haven't changed the compact and its hte right stuff.  So, maybe you get what you pay for. I won't buy here again",0
"This lotion is lightweight, can easily use morning and night. Not sure if it does more for the redness but seems to.",1
"Both gloves and socks are too big! They are even big for my husband!

When wearing them, the material barely touches your skin and thus does not ""spa"" at all. Totally a waste of money!",0
"Love the Prosecco fragrence.  LOVE.IT.
However, I prefer the reed diffuser over the spray. My room smells clean all the time.",1

Seriously, this will probably take about 200 zillion years to reach a half life.  Very bad.  And imagine if you did not have serious tools in the house!!

Can't imagine why these hot rollers needed such a secure package, but it is not something you would want to give to an elderly person or someone who is not extremely able.

Once you succeed in getting the package open and you MAKE sure you push the power cord in really tightly, these are great.",1
When I apply Toppik it does not bond to my hair! It falls right onto my scalp! Soo my hairline still looks thin but I have blotches and blotches of brown powder patches. I bought a Toppik spray that is to help attache the Toppik. It does help the fibers attache a little better but the spay makes my hair stick together like glue! Glad it works for many of you. Does not work for me!,0
"Favorite new body wash. Doesn't dry out my skin like other body washes. And the smell is so refreshing and invigorating. It is not too powerful but, it does help wake you up during those M-F showers before heading out the door to work.",1
"This is a great facial cleanser that comes with different removable heads (regular, sensitive and massage) to fit your particular needs as well as an awesome carrying/travel case. It's very light and works well to remove excess dirt without irritating the delicate skin of the face.",1
"My hair is think and dry! This is the closest thing that has come to flatening it, but it doesn't work miracles.",1
"Very nice color combination and great price. Not easy to apply though. After a month, it became even more thick and  more difficult to use.",1
Excellent. The best by far. Does not leave your face greasy and it does not burn your eyes.,1
"Expensive but it does a good job. The one thing that I like is that it does not have a scent to it or very light scent. Usually I like strong scented skin products but this one works lighter. My daughter and wife love it but the rest of us have also been using it too. Great when out in the sun and it is not real greasy either which some of these products are. Wife likes using it on her face when we are outside the boys like it on their hands-makes your skin feel soft and young again.

If the price was lower would be a staple in our house-will be watching for sales on Amazon.",1
i feel the bronzer looks heavy and not a good look,0
It was very very sheer even with several costs. Disappointed in color displayed versus actual color that is on the display bottle.,0
"Love this product, so good on my hair!",1
"Gentle on the skin, and the lemony pleasant aroma is very refreshing.
Definite repurchase, this one.
BTW, may I add this is my 3rd Michael Todd toner.",1
"Decent amount of color, smooth application.  But you still need a good primer/base (esp if you have oily lids) for it to last throughout the day.  (I still needed to touch-up occasionally.)  I have sensitive eyes and this liner did not cause me any irritation (however I do not line the inner rims of my eyes, I keep the liner just on the outside [along the lash line] and do a subtle cat-eye.)",1
"This stuff works great but it contains polyethylene, the plastic microbeads that have been banned as a significant environmental concern. The law allows them into 2017, but continuing to use this stuff is terrible for all bodies of water and sewage.

"I bought my first tube of Malin + Goetz Vitamin B5 in Canada, where the clerk called it ""The Fountain of Youth"". It is the best moisturizer I've ever used. However, Amazon needs to update their photo of the product because you don't get an 8 oz. bottle of it as pictured, you get a 7.5 oz. tube.",1
My husband got hooked on this hair ingredient while on a cruise and is a great savings here.  Highly recommend!,1
Wax works great but there is so little of it. Way over priced.,0
Don't buy this!  It didn't do the job and smells really strong and awful!  CAN'T RETURN THIS! BEWARE!,0
"Nothing else like it - fabulous for keeping old skin looking really good.  I've used it for years & everybody thinks I'm 10 years
younger than I am!",1
great appliance,1
I was not a fan of the scent. The smell smelt like bleach/alcohal. Not what I find sexy. I want to cover that smell up.,0
"Love this product. It's light and not greasy. I would recommend to anyone. I have extermely sensitive skin, and this doesn't not break me out.",1
Was great while it worked. Broke in less that 6 months. Huge waist of money.,0
The color combination is not what I want!,0
"The main thing you need to know about this is that it is definitely for SOME people. Before you buy any sort of permanent hair removal product, do your research. This is the least expensive model on the market, so that can be tempting to some. So what you need to know is this: It will take longer than most treatments on the market. 2. It uses light instead of just laser. 3. It is mostly for people with great contrast between skin color and hair color. I would recommend this for people with Hispanic or Jewish heritage, because of the lighter skin and the darker hair color. I am Hispanic and have seen immediate results. My girlfriend is naturally blonde with pale skin and it basically does nothing for her. For black people, unless you are very light skinned, it will not work for you and you will wind up having burns all over your skin where the light is zapping any kind of color off you. Even though my skin has only a bit of color on it, my arms, where I naturally tan from being in the sun at all, have white marks all over from it zapping the tan off me. It's not bad, and it fades generally easily. Also you need to not do any kind of tanning, and be generally not tattooed in the places you want covered. The cartridge it comes with last quite a while. For full body treatments in my case, the cartridge lasted around 5 months. I then bought the long life cartridge and have been using it ever since.

Like I said, it takes quite a while to see results. I've been using this for about 7 months now and it has removed about 40% of my hair. Still in other places there has been no hair removal at all. The face, the chest, the stomach, and bikini have essentially not seen any progress. I can't tell you why, though I would love to hear some clarification on the matter. I would recommend also getting some sort of protective goggles, as the flash is very bright and I cannot imagine that it wouldn't cause some sort of eye damage trying to do your face or other close body parts. Make sure to clean the screen and take good care of it and you can make the price point of this item more valuable than many 500 dollar models on the market. I highly recommend this for the above mentioned groups.",1
Glad to own a comb like this. It is all worth it. Thank you,1
"I was excited to receive the SachaJuan Ocean Mist shampoo and conditioner after reading the reviews. I was so disappointed after my first use but thought I'd continue to use it and see if it would grow on me. It did not. This is very expensive for what you get. I have drug store shampoo and conditioner that smells so much better than this and performs better than this. The shampoo comes out gloppy like very cheap shampoo, not silky and smooth.  The conditioner doesn't really condition at all. As a matter of fact, I ended up adding leave in conditioner after my shower because my hair felt course and dry.",0
Love this color!,1
Right when I received this wand I wanted to put it to use. After using it ONE time it started to shut off and I would have to cut it back on numerous times to finish my hair.,0
Such a rip off compared to what you actually get such a small bottle,0
Curling iron broke in less than 90 days. Ive had several of these and never a problem.,0
"It holds my hair very nicely and at the end of the day I can brush or comb my hair without it being sticky.

It is a max hold so IT HOLDS your hair, little movement, but my hair is just about shoulder length and I just need the front to stay put and not fall in my face.  Love it.",1
I like this product. First smelled in magazine and liked it. It seems to last ok not all day though. But the container is big and has a lot in it.,1
"When I bought this product I thought, well seem a lot of money for only 150 ml. However, it is worth every penny. Great shaving experience and no irritation of the skin. I can only recommend this product!",1
"Full disclosure, I've bought Mama Mio Tummy Rub Oil for all three of my pregnancies, and I used to give it 5 stars.

Too long didn't read summary: I just don't feel like there's anything magic in the bottle although I do feel that using some good oils can make a difference. I also would never use the perfumes on my baby and generally avoid them while pregnant.

Still reading? Here's the ingredients and why I'm changing my rating.

Almond oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, argan oil, sacha inchi oil, rose hip oil, olive oil, vitamin E, and the rest are all perfumes (Parfum, Limonene, Linalool, Citral, Citronellol, Evernia Furfuracea Extract)

Something you should realize about stretch marks is that they typically come in the very, very end. All those reviews where people say they've used it for less than 37 weeks? Ignore them. Also, the best person to compare the effectiveness of any stretch mark prevention is immediate family. I did get stretch marks, but they were not nearly as bad as my mother and sister and my skin has rebounded soooo much better, so I felt that the former Mama Mio tummy rub oil was effective.

So why did I change my rating?
1. I think I liked the old one that I used for my first 2 pregnancies better, it seemed to go further for the amount that you used. I really wish I could see the ingredients. They also changed the smell slightly, and I don't find this one as nice, but that's not the deal breaker . . .
2. I finally translated the ingredients and looked them up. The EWG has articles not recommending some of the perfumes listed because they are potential allergens that should probably be avoided with infants. So even though I'm not bothered with the smell and it's not deadly or anything, it's probably best to avoid this product for that reason alone. And yes, during the third trimester babies actually can smell your perfume.
3. Although the oils listed are good, the price is terrible, especially if you pay full price.  For example, almond oil can be purchased on Amazon for $15 for 16oz. The only oil listed that can't be purchased for a fraction of the cost of a bottle is Sacha Inchi Oil, which is number 5 on the list anyway . . .

What's a pregnant lady to do? I'm probably going to use up the rest of the bottle and then try make something on my own. My midwife recommends coco butter and olive oil. I've seen several recommendations for rose hip oil and essential oils such as lavender, geranium, and frankincense. Some combo of that or essential oils with any of the oils in this product is probably just as effective minus the perfumes and the overpriced glass bottle. Good luck!",0
"I love the Davines shampoo, conditioner and hair oil.  This product not so much. leaves my hair a little too stiff, no matter how little I use.  Smells great as all their products do, but would not order it again.",0
I don't feel it cleans your skin as thoroughly as it should. I use it as a morning cleanser rather than a nightly cleanser bc it doesn't seem to get my makeup off too well. It doesn't dry out my skin either.,0

I love this cream but unfortunately it came without the cellophane wrapping and it didn't smell right...Not the same product.,0
"I suppose for very specific types and (tiny) degrees of hair loss/thinning, this might, MIGHT, be useful for certain circumstances. Medium to low resolution (or somewhat distant) photographs and videos, for example. But if your thinking this is going to make you look like you have a full head of thick hair to someone you're having a face-to-face conversation with, think again. Up close, it looks exactly like what it is: colored dust in your hair and on your scalp. It does cover fine hairs and make them look thicker, but it does NOT cling or adhere enough to be practical. It barely adheres at all and you can brush it right out with your hand. It's just dust, after all. It also mottles your scalp and makes it look dirty. I personally think I look better with out it. YMMV.",0
Broke my skin out. Smells good but cant use it.,0
"I moisturize first with vitamin E and either apricot, jojoba, or coconut oil and then I dip a cotton swab into the Badescu pink solution, place it on each pimple and leave it over night.

I like this product a lot but less than its sister Ballerina. Use one or the other every day. Can be used as eyeshadow.,1
"After seeing the infomercials on TV saying and showing that this works on all hair types I was surprised at the results I got. Although, my hair felt conditioned and soft after my hair dried with the product, my hair looked awful. It was frizzy and the curls were not defined. I have normal-fine curly hair. When I wash my hair the next day there feels like there's a lot of residue left behind in my hair from the product that one shampoo wash wouldn't get out right away. Weird. Guess its not great for every hair type. I dumped the rest of the bottle.",0
"Did not, in any way, clean mascara or liquid liner. Is this a fake?  The videos I've seen show an almost miraculous removal of make up and this hardly got my powdered foundation off my fast. Would not recommend, save your money. In the trash it goes",0

"UPDATE 01/05/2016: Bought this in March 2015.  Even with only very light occasional home use this switch has stopped working and eventually fell out!.  Now to turn it on I have to plug and unplug.  Not worth the price tag.

I bought this on the recommendation of my hair stylist.  I was considering this or a Chi, but the price was a determining factor.  It's heats up quick.  This spring could be a little tighter.  I have to be careful when curling to not let my hair fall out from under the clip.",0
"I think this will be perfact for summer, but still too dry for people with dry skin. I suggest using cleansing foam for dry skin.",1

Great color it is matte but it don't last more than few hours,0

She recommended this product along with the lotion and told me to use the ""Salux Nylon Japanese Bath cloth"".  notices changes in my skin after the 1st use.

Horrible.  Does not work at all. Would not recommend.,0

"I really like this product, and it's a thick cream that somehow doesn't settle into your skin in an unnatural way.  While their stick product is easier to apply, this Cover Creme is also pretty fast to apply, and it really stays in place.  The coverage is pretty opaque, but that's what makes it great for covering up things you want to conceal.  Finding the correct color online was a bit tricky, but the color I chose works well with my fair skin.",1
There is lots of thick liquid mascara in the tube. So much that the brush comes out very wet and caused the lashes to stick together badly. I have  to wipe the brush clean with a tissue in order to use the product. I am wasting most of the mascara when I do  This was not what I expected from a premium product.,0
Don't care for fragrence,1
It helped with the dryness around my nose. I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't like how much comes out with one squirt.,1
The best product for long hair!,1
"For ten bucks, a trusted choice!  It smells great, builds a nice, rich, thick lather and the blade feels wonderful as it passes across your skin.  On your very first use, it feels like ""fireworks"" going off.  There's bit of a tingle as the blade shaves the hair away.  I chalk this up to the menthol and eucalyptus ingredients.

However, I have to drop my rating by one star.  There have been times when this soap gets somewhat temperamental.  When this happens, I simply  can't seem to get a decent lather worked up in my shaving bowl. I find myself going back to the tub to reload my bush.  Perhaps I need to use a bit more water or maybe the brush I'm using (I rotate shaving brushes) isn't compatible with the soap.  I'm not sure.

But when the stars align and things fall into place, this soap, and the lather it builds, is a real treat!",1
"I bought this by mistake. I have used it a few times, and found that it absolutely does not wash out of your hair with water or soap. I just took a 20 min shower scrubbing it out of my hair, and it is still goopy and tacky. What an awful product. Get the classic pomade. 100% better",0
What  I say I love Elemis!  This really cleans the skin and leaves your face nice and smooth.  I use it every week and really have noticed a difference in my face.,1
I used this product several times until I finished the bottle.  I put it on my hair and slept with it or left it on for several hours.  My hair felt worse each time after.  My girlfriend swears by it and has the most beautiful hair I have ever seen so pretty it looks fake.  She says her hair is soft after.,0
"I BOUGHT THE BABYLISS PRO NANO TECH FLAT IRON FROM eSTOREPLUS ON JANUARY 14, 2009. I HAVE BOUGHT ONE BEFORE FOR MY SISTER AND IS A GOOD PRODUCT, BUT THE SECOND ONE PLATES ARE OXIDATED. I MADE A CLAIM TO THE SELLER AND AMAZON AND NEITHER HAS RESPOND TO IT. I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING FROM THAT SELLER. AND IN MY CASE I WILL NOT BUY ANYTHING ELSE FROM AMAZON BECAUSE THEY CAN CHARGE YOUR CARD FOR THE PURCHASE BUT THEY BECOME DEAF WHEN A CUSTOMER NEED HELP.",0
OK - very expensive - I wouldnt purchase again,0
I use this before blow drying or flat ironing my hair.  It helps to keep my hair looking smooth and shiny.  It smells really good too.  It works as well on dry hair as it does on wet.,1
Good,1
I use both the foundation and this powder for setting. Covers all my skin blemishes. Excellent product.,1
"Amen has a amazing scent , not overwhelming. It was a present for my sons and their girlfriends love it.",1
"This cream is not for super sensitive skin.  It made my face break out in a rash and itchy within a day.  I was hoping for  a ""face"" lotion but am very dissappointed. So far the only thing that works on my super sensitive skin is plain water and Dove Sensitive(not available anymore) face lotion or Aveeno Baby Fragrance Free(only $6 a bottle)lotion.",0
Not greasy formula! Great!,1
This a nice product for those with fine limp hair whether it is curly or straight. This work pretty well the best I can compare it too is when you put dry shampoo on but it will last longer. Kind of works like hairspray and sea salt spray mixture. Probably won't buy it again though. But I am a rusk lover so I would recomend,1
"This is a sassy candle.

Its box directions are pretty funny, if you don't mind your candle being sort of insulting. Its instructions are also printed on the glass of the candle, in case you thought you could get away from the sass.

It smells pretty nice when it burns, not too overwhelming. I did notice a bit of black smoke coming from the wick as it burned, so its a bit of a mood killer there.

It lit pretty easily and I had it burning for several hours and you can barely tell.",1
I got such bottle with defect. Came liquid out of the bottle. I made photoes. I can proove but i have no place to attache it.,0
"The plastic broke about a year after I started using it, so I just have to throw it away. I disn't even get to the point to replace the pad. This was my biggest concern when I bought it, but I should've looked at the thin plastic closer. It was working fine while I was able to use it.",0
I miss the old volumizer.,0
I bought this a couple times and thought it was just a fluke but it made my face break out and I am not normally sensitive to stuff.,0
"The John Varvatos Vintaage colonge is quit unique in that is smells diffeet to everyone who smells it on te wearer. To me it smells like apple pie to my girlfriend it reminds her of flowers in the jungle of her childhood home in Villa Hermosa, Mexico. It is quite a unique combination that I frequently get asked ""what colonge are you wearing""",1
"What you see is not what you shall receive, false advertising !! You will get Hugo MAN and not the good old BOSS i really liked and whats in the pic",0
"I have used three different Baxter Pomades and they are all really good. This one was good too but for my fine hair I like their pomade for hard water better, it has a little more hold. This formula is a little light for my hair but still a very good product. Leaves your hair soft, wavy and shiny with the fly-a- ways tamed down. Not at all greasy looking or heavy. You only need a very small amount, I comb it through my wet hair and shape it and let dry naturally. No strong fragrance just a very light subtle citrus scent that goes away shortly after applying. Great stuff",1
haven't seen a change at all. very pricey for a product that doesn't do what it's supposed to do,0
Did not help smooth out the deep hole acne marks on My face so foundation still looks terrible on my face. Depressing,0
"Just gotten this in the mail but it appears to have been opened and used prior - tamper-proof sticker was cut on the box and inside, the plastic bag holding the power adaptor has been ripped open. Also, the main unit's head attachment has slightly frayed bristles. Wasn't this supposed to be a new item? Extremely disappointed.",0
The cap popped off immediately and now it leaks everywhere. I cannot open it without the entire cap coming off.,0
"Some of Elemis' products are incredible, like the SOS for men.  This is just another moisturizer really.  Though everyone's skin is different I suppose.  SOS is better.",0
Nah,0
"The ""Sledgehammer"". Very close shave. The closest. If your technique is off, pain and blood. If you think you KNOW how to shave with a DE,
Get this razor and try. Like the song: ""Life has made a whole lot of fools, always reach you something you never learned in school. Somebody got to suffer, somebody sure got to feel some pain...""",1
"This flat iron never worked. The first time I plugged it in it flashed ""off"" then I turned it on, it heated to 400 in about a minute and then turned off. I tried unplugging it and resetting my outlet but the ""off"" would not even come back. It was completely dead. I tried again the next day and same thing happened. I have to believe that mine was faulty because there's no way that a flat iron should be that complicated to use.",0
"This massager sort of drags on your skin, more of a nubby scratcher than a massager. I thought I'd get smoother movement in the shower, using it wet, but it seems to make it drag even more. Overall, this is a highly overpriced piece of molded plastic.",0
"UPDATE August 2017
-------------------------------
It's 91 outside of the RV we rented --and that's the temperature and the humidity.  And though we were cramped for space in this little RV I'm glad I brought this Vichy thermal water.  I'm not one of those people who is crazy for the heat. In fact, I'm more a cool/cold weather person, but this spray made it much more tolerable.

I think it's the aerosol expansion that cools the mist; but in any case, I found it refreshing and a nice afternoon pick me up. Also nice on areas that are feeling a little warm from too much sun.

UPDATE May 2017
-----------------------------
When I first used this I wasn't sure what I felt, but over time I've become a bit of an addict.  Whether it's Winter Dry or a Summer Melt-Down, this spray is just very good at making me feel recovered.  I've used it under lotion and over lotion during the winter.  My skin feels less chapped afterwards.  It actually 'revives' lotion that has been dehydrated.  The same goes for my skin.

We've had hot days already this Spring and I've spritzed away while gardening.  I have water to hydrate the inner me and this cooling spray to revive my skin.

My suggestion if you aren't sure it's worth the price is to try one can and stretch out using it over a full year.  Maybe there will only be one season where you appreciate it, or maybe two.

================

WHAT YOU GET is water in a can.  This particular can has water and a propellant (which I believe is nitrogen/carbon dioxide), and quite a bit of text in some of the smallest fonts I've seen on a product.  I can't even read it with my 2x reading glasses.

One these miserable days of Summer I really enjoyed misting it on.  The expanding propellant gas meant that the moisture was cool and soothing.  I noticed no other secondary results.

I was hoping that I might benefit from 'the minerals' by misting myself and then applying my nighttime lotion.  I noticed nothing different.

DESPITE the silliness of buying water in a very small can I will in fact purchase this product in the future.  Why?  Airplanes.  You know how dry the air is on long trips.  I imagine that misting my face a couple of times during a trip will feel marvelous and be worth the price.",1
Really cloying smelly smell.  I couldn't get past that so I haven't actually tried it.  Non-returnable so watch out.,0
Its not real,0
Leaves my hair crispy.  Would not repurchase,0
It seems to have made the dryness around my nails worse,0
poor product for crown coverage,0
"This does what it's supposed to do. I've been using this about two weeks. I'm definitely noticing fewer lines around my eyes and mouth, and the difference on my forehead is striking.

However - in the past I've had trouble with retinol products because of my very sensitive skin. I have eczema and retinol can cause that to flare up. But with this being a lighter strength, I thought I'd try it anyway.  The first few days I applied as directed, also being very careful to make sure I moisturized well on my more eczema-prone areas. After four days, I stopped using the retinol around my mouth and eyes as these areas where the skin is already thin were starting to redden.  After a few days, the redness went away, so I tried again, but only applying it every other day. This seems to work well so far, I'm still seeing reduction in thin lines but the redness has not returned after a week.

So my verdict is, if you've tried retinol in the past and had trouble, this might work for you.  Take it slow and watch your face closely for changes, both the good and bad ones, and be prepared to adjust your routine. I'm very pleased with how it's working.",1
Stays on most of the day,1
Great moisturizer.,1
"its more effective when used with the stretch mark cream.
it does take about 2 months though to see a difference and you have to continue using it. once you stop, the skins sags again",1
"I've been using neuLash for years and my lashes were so long and lush, I would get compliments all the time!!! But in the past 1 1/2 years or so, I've noticed my lashes aren't looking much different than before. They used to touch the lenses of my sunglasses and they don't anymore. They are barely better than when I first started to use it about 5 years ago. I am convinced the manufacturer has taken out some of the lash growing formula because it just doesn't work like it used to. I am very disappointed and wonder if it's worth the $$$ if I can't tell much difference. It's NOT cheap! My other thought is that you get immune to it!  Would love to hear some feedback.",0
I love this fiber putty! Works great for frizzies on top and for fine hair. It's not super dry which I love.,1
"The cream is thick & creamy, bit sticky. Not my first choice really",0
For years I have only worn two perfumes (one for summer and Burberry Touch for fall/winter.) This time around I noticed that they changed the formula slightly. The perfume itself is slightly more pink in color and is not as musky or strong as previous bottles. If you're used to the old Burberry Touch this isn't it...but still my favorite nonetheless.,1
"This is my favorite neutral-color eyeshadow palette. Between my daughters and me, we have one of each of the Urban Decay ""Naked"" palettes (1, 2, 3, and basics) but this one from Lorac is my favorite. I find that there are more useable colors on this palette. I'm giving it 4 stars overall because the magnetic closure doesn't seem substantial enough to keep it closed when taking it on travel.",1
I have been using this product for years! Love it! Best base I've ever used!,1
"I like it so far. Not earth shattering results, yet.",1
This is not a real Image product.  I have been using this for years and fell for this scam.,0
Good value,1
"Great product. Well worth the money. I have blonde extensions so I'm always worried about damaging them since I blow dry and curl my hair a few times per week. This product works great protecting my hair form all the damage. I read all the other reviews before I purchased this and as many others mentioned not to use too much of this product on your hair, I only sprayed it lightly from the middle down to the ends of my hair and that works great.",1
"This product works fine to remove make-up but it leaves a VERY ""oily"" residue behind on your skin.  Since the blue bottle is ""supposed"" to be for Oily/ Combination skin--- why would I want to add more oil to my face?  I don't.

For that reason I only gave it 2 stars.  If your skin is very dry you'd probably love it.",0
"I have used CND shellac quite a bit but this particular one just wouldn't set -ni tries several times and even had a friend who is a professional try it to no avail - unfortunately because it is flammable, it cannot be returned so you're stuck with product that's bad :((",0
"Used the entire bottle.  Applied it every morning and night directly to age spots and saw no significant change.  Still have to use concealer on age spots, same as before I tried it.",0
"Good, sturdy stand. Acrylic (basically hard plastic). Smooth and nice for the price, however we have had to rig the stand a little bit due to the fact that my husband's brush does not fit into the stand perfectly. But, it serves its purpose. Good product for the price! I would buy from the seller again! Thanks!",1
"Thick wipe, lightly scented, and they clean well.  The only quip is the cost: my fianc and I make fun of the price of these wipes, saying they're our ""$1000 wipes.""  I only use these at home, and use different wipes in the diaper bag for occasional use.",1
Mild in the beginning but after a few uses the fragrance is more prevalent.  It's has good moisture and not sticky,1
"I love this hair product.  Makes my hair feel amazing and light weight and really improves my ends.  I have thin hair but a lot of hair.  Also, my color does not fade as quickly. Pretty expensive but worth it.",1
I really like this spray.  I love the feel and the smell of it.  It works especially well after I just have my hair trimmed.  I am in desperate need of a cut now so I cannot say that it is a miracle spray but it definitely has helped keep my hair in decent shape while waiting for my next appointment.  I am not disappointed by any means.  I love Paul Mitchell products.  They are always high quality.,1
"Color looked different than the color I expected, to tell you the truth never used this polish yet cause really not color I wanted and not paying to send back.  Hard to buy nail polish and makeup on line cause the colors look so different than in person.",0
expensive and saw NO difference whatsoever,0
these don't work.,0
"I was looking for a shampoo that will prevent my hair from getting oily as often. First of all, it came in an open box, even though I had to return the first one and order a new one. More importantly, it literally does not foam and leaves my hair with no volume at all.",0
"It says within 4 months to see results! Who has got that kind of time??? This cream is no different from any other that I've tried.
$100 for 1.7 oz is so overpriced.",0
"...because the product itself is worthy of 5 stars.  All of the 5 star reviews here reflect how I feel about the product.  My issue comes from the container that holds the product.

I bought the 2-pack of the dry shampoo to use over the summer while my husband and I traveled in our motorhome.  I knew we would be moving frequently and doing a lot of dry-camping, which meant conserving as much water as possible in between the occasional full hook-up camping.  I knew I wasn't going to be able to wash my hair more than twice a week, and after reading the reviews here I knew this would be a good solution to stretch washing my hair.

I was able to get 4 ""shampoos"" out of the first container.  I have long hair, and knew to only spray towards my scalp and not the middle or ends of my hair.  I would use about 5 brief sprays each time. I thought I should have gotten more out of the container, but thought perhaps I was being unnecessarily excessive with my sprays.  I opened and used the second shampoo can two days ago.  I noticed the container hissing after I finished spraying, so I adjusted the nozzle and got it to stop.  I capped the can, and put it away.  I went to use the can last night and when picking it up felt it was completely empty.  I was pretty upset, after having spent over $24 for two cans, to realize that apparently my dry shampoo had been leaking out of the container!  There was some powder residue inside the cap and around the metal ring and nozzle area.

I thought a lot about what could have happened with the shampoo containers.  While we have been traveling around the U.S., and being in varied elevations, I do not believe that would have affected them, as I am traveling with other aerosol containers and they have not been affected either.

I am very disappointed, because I actually do LOVE the product.  It's the best dry shampoo I've ever used.  I just can't justify spending that sort of money on containers that leak out their precious (to me!) product.",0
"OK, yes, this stuff is a little on the ""pricey"" side. But I'm here to tell you that, after 50 years of shaving, I've tried hundreds of razors, blades, shave clubs ... you name it. And this is THE best after-shave experience you'll ever have.",1
Works great and has a medium hold. Has a really nice sage minty smell in the beginning but goes away quick. Feels natural and better than chemicals they sell in other products.,1
I have severe backne on my back (of course!!!! LOL) and this helps clearing it out great! Really great!,1
"Very poorly made, does not file, just slips around the nail edge. Very disappointing.  Sold and shipped by Amazon, yet NOT eligible for a return. Why?!? I would not waste my money on this product.",0
"After using this for a few weeks I've already noticed a positive difference with smoother skin.

One of the (many) ingredients at the top of the list is Alpha-Arbutin.  This ingredient is proven to help lighten age spots because it ""works by slowly releasing hydroquinone through hydrolysis, which in turn blocks Tyrosinase activity and reduces the skins melanin (pigmentation) production.""  The other major ingredients include skin conditioners/moisturizers and antioxidants.

Amazon is an authorized reseller for SkinMedica products and this is a convenient place to buy this product for less than what they charge at my dermatologist office.",1
"I've used this product before and really like it. However, what came to me was not the product. It was not the same color, texture or smell. In fact, it smelled like glue. I returned it and bought it at a local store so that I could make sure the product inside the package was the right stuff.",0
"I bought this sample product for the express use of determining if it will be worthwhile to purchase the full size. Since I get credit for what I paid towards the full size, I figure it is worthwhile to see if it will help my skin. It takes only a small amount to determine if this will help. I am going to continue to use this sample to make sure before investing a large amount of money in the full size.",1
Don't buy this product! My face broke out in a horrible rash.,0
Not as great as I would be expecting. Wear out and don't look pretty after the first use. Will not be purchasing again.,0
Sticky. I would not recommend,0
The power came broken,0
"I swear by far the best cologne I've ever owned. It's different from the rest, has its own style and not over powerful, and people notice. It sets you different from the rest. Little sweet, little spicy, fresh, and just perfect.",1
"Ordered early for daughter's Christmas present, as she said it had really good reviews. Well, it sucked! Didn't work as promised and only had half the clips needed to use all the rollers she needs for her hair. Because I ordered it early (before Nov 1st), it's too late to get my money back, so there is $105 down the toilet!",0
"My skin does not have any allege sign with this toner, but I didn't see too much effect on my skin. I feel like spaying cold tap water on my face. It doesn't work for me.",0
"Purchased economy size after trying a sample from Ouidad. Also bought their clarifying shampoo, Water Works. I shampoo or cowash daily. Seemed to work well for a few days, then build-up required clarifying shampoo every third day. This one makes my hair feel defined with a little crunch and good shine the first 2 uses, then build-up makes hair rough and fuzzy and matte (like well-loved gnarly doll hair). So day 3 required clarifying shampoo which left hair cleaner, but wiry. Went back to site and ""rediscovered"" the product I used a few years ago under a different name. Ouidad VitaCurl is also subtitled Tress Effects. Aha! That's the one with light clove fragrance--it's also water based and washes out easily, even with cowash or conditioner only.",0
"love it, but for travel the lid caves in easily with any pressure.",1
"Useless scrub it literally does nothing! It doesn't exfoliate anything! I find the reading funny ""wonder how you ever went without it"" lol. This product is same as any other lip balm its also overpriced for the name. Once you stop putting it on the results fade away, so it is like an every day kind of product.",0
Definitely the best shaving cream I've ever used.,1
This spray makes my face feel so fresh and moisturized when I use it. The only downside is that I'm not crazy about the smell of roses (but that's personal opinion).,1
"I have been buying Hot Tools for years and enjoy their products. I used this item an average of 2-3 times per week and expected it to last me a couple of years as the ones I have owned in the past. However, it shorted out and then refused to turn on after owning for only about 8 months. Disappointed and trying to figure out if I should replace or check a different brand.",0
"This might be an OK product for someone who doesn't sweat much at all or never really gets smelly. Didn't work for me.

Pros:
-Natural ingrediens
-Made in USA

Cons:
-Didn't do much of anything to prevent odor, if it had any scent at all it may have worked. My mistake for thinking I'd be OK with unscented
-Price",0
I love the smell and it does make my face feel nice and refreshed but I have begun to break out a little :(,1
"It was working fine for awhile, but one day (even though it was turned off), it started smoking and almost caught fire. The entire, very expensive device was ruined and I had to throw away (all the plastic melted and warped). Very disappointed and will never buy again!",0
I used it as toner and smells very good.,1
"This is just what I was looking for to use on the backs of my hands.  Retinol, Creme de la Mer exfoliant, C & E serum, collagen did make an improvement but I still had hard skin with webs of wrinkles at the knuckles and down the fingers.  In one night, this puffed out the wrinkles noticeably.  Seems to last beyond 24 hours.  Don't know long term cumulative effects or if I will eventually no longer react to the venum, but am happy I am trying it.  Will update review later.",1
"If there is one thing to buy from Philip B, it's this Russian Amber Imperial Shampoo. It leaves my hair looking young like a teen, and I'm 43. Smells amazing, and most importantly it works on dry chemically damaged hair. One used, and I could see a difference in texture and softness of my hair. It's expensive though, so I will try to use other shampoos in between to help make it last a bit longer. I've used just about every brands in the market, and this shampoo by far is the best I've ever used.",1
"These are by far the best hot rollers I've used!  The box set arrived pretty fast, with pro clippers and all.  Brand new.  Easy to roll on hair, no non-sense, great & shiny curls for my long and thick hair.  The only thing I noticed is that although they heat up fast, they also cool down very fast.  I got an extra set of babyliss replacement rollers, so that I can continue to hot-roll my curls after the first 5 cool down.  I hope Amazon can continue to price this set just above $25 so that it comes with free shipping.  They changed the price to a dollar under $25, so with a lot more extra shipping fees I gave up purchasing a second set.",1
"I was unsure about this at first, but I can definitely tell it working. I recommend using the shampoo, conditioner, and the regrowth treatment.",1
If I could give less than one star i would. Lots of money but doesn't work.,0
"I tried this product ever hopefull to find a great replacement for my failing deodorant. This, at first seems to be excellent, the reviews appear positive and it seems to be made of natural ingredients, all good so far. However, and this may be specific from one person  to the next, but it just didn't work. Id be at work, attend a stressful meeting and it really did nothing to protect me, and others, from my body odour. Sad to say its not the best deodorant. I am now using Native and find it to be excellent. I was hopeful, but you cant win them all. Who knows, perhaps it would work for you.",0
"Not for me...unlike face make-up for women that matches their skin tone, Toppik is problematic as you are literally throwing a fine dark powder on you scalp. Once on, it looks OK but touch your hair and you are immediately covered in dirt. If you are planning to not touch your hair or be anywhere near other humans with good eye-sight and do not care if it's obvious that you are masking your balding head with dark powder then this is fine.",0
"To me, the fragrance is similiar to the discontinued Nomad line. It has kind of a powderfeel and soft fragrance. Will buy regular sizes in future.",1
"Good match for my NC 40 skin tone
It is very thick and a little goes a long way
Make sure your skin is prepped - exfoliate and moisturize before applying to avoid it being cakey.
I like it for spot coverage
Or sheer it out with a damp beauty blender and a drop of facial oil
It does contain some ingredients that sensitive skin types may react to, so read the ingredient list first",1
"I really like this shampoo. It's natural, has a nice mild scent and hydrates my hair.",1
I got many compliments . I love it. I recommend every man should have in thief collection,1
"Was not as good as I'd hoped after using other Oscar Blandi Dry Shampoo's in the past. Just felt it wasn't as effective, I tried holding closer and further away. I tried letting it set more before rubbing/brushing, I tried blow dryer, I tried just about everything. Even on barely dirty one day old hair I couldn't get it to look fresh.",0
"Bought this as a substitute for my usual Deva Curl Styling Cream and I'm pleasantly pleased to find that it is just as easy to use and seems nearly interchangeable. I use it while my hair is still super damp and apply to small pumps to my long, curly hair. I also leave in some conditioner and use a little styling foam and my hair is a dream- wish I had this routine for years instead of just months, but I'm happy to have soft, shiny curls on a daily basis now. Ouidad is a definite standby for curly hair!",1
The eye shadows go on very smoothly and have great color. I'm not use to wearing earth tones so there's a lot to work with. It's easy to build intensity. I'd prefer colors that are a little more complimentary to each other. Great colors to fill in brows with and to line eyes.,1
"It's either a crummy product or I received a fake\imposter product.  I'm not sure which.  I tossed it in the garbage.  It was a very thin, watery cream consistency which did not add moisture or smoothness to the hair...only a heavy fragrance.  For reference, my hair is fine (probably 2a type), a bit dry and frizzy right now, so I was just trying to find ways to battle the humidity here where I live.  This product was not the way.",0
"Ok, buy this. Simply put. Don't worry about the SPF. I had 3 months in the middle east in gym shorts, short sleeves and a baseball cap. I applied in the morning and sweated for the next 8 hours and never had a burn. I am quite pale - the sun and I have never agreed. It's not oily, it doesn't burn the eyes and a little bit goes a very long way.

There is no comparison.",1
very dissapointed as the plug does not stay in the outlet . it is looses and flimsy and cheap!,0
"Although the bottle appears to be different from the picture, but product is freshly made in 2013 and I am happy!",1
Great eyeshadow palette. It's become a staple in my everyday makeup routine. This is great inexpensive product for makeup beginners who want a nice neutral palette to experiment with a variety of looks.,1
Due to allergies I have very itchy eyes and had to give up eye make up and mascara. And although this does not stay on my eyes all day if it is a bad allergy day they are the closest I have come to finding something that works for me.  I am now on my second tube of Stila and will continue to order in the future.,1
A repeat purchase here. Great product as recommended (and sold at a higher price) by our dermatologist. My wife and I have had melanoma in the past but this product does a good job of protecting our skin from a repeat.,1
Best hairspray ever! Smells great and works on all hair types! I have used thus hairspray since October 2013 and its fabulous!!,1
"I switched from bare minerals to pur minerals after a recommendation from an beauty store employee. I love the pressed compact because when I travel, it doesn't get all over the place. The loose powder is a bit messy and I noticed I was losing a lot of the product on my brush. I don't have that problem with pur minerals! So much easier to use! It has the added SPF which I love as well.",1
"This is the best hand cream I have ever used.  I have psoriasis and my skin is very dry.  After applying this cream, the itching disappears, and I find myself comfortable again.  Another great plus -  this cream is not greasy.",1
"I have very fine hair that's wavy, I straighten it almost every day. It gets very dry and brittle, I noticed far more breakage using this product and I love the Agadir line normally. I quit using it almost immediately.",0
This product arrived with a large dent in the metal bottle.  I find it did not live up to its advertisement and would like to return it.,0
Love this product. It is great for curly hair.,1
Nice smell nothing more,0
"Smells like black pepper, which is not a nice smell for a deodorant. $20 for the same effectiveness as a whatever you can pick up in a store. Very disappointed.",0
The peach color does cover dark circles for people with an olive skin complexion but wish this was a little more moisturizing.,1
Too sticky. Didn't really help razor glide so I've stopped using it.,0
no effect,0
It burned when I used it and gave me a red face. I liked the container. It was the only shea butter face soap I could find. I used to love Mode de Vie pure shea butter soap but I can no longer find it.,0
"I ordered a 1-1/4"" which was too big for my fine hair. Unfortunately I threw away the box so I was unable to return it. My hairdresser use a 1"" on my hair and it works fantastic. I should have checked with her before I ordered this one to make sure I was ordering the correct barrel size.",0
"I have been using this mascara for years.  It is the best I have personally found.  It looks the same as the expensive department store brands (used them for years) but it washes off EASILY with soap and water.  No tugging or buying another make-up remover product, just use whatever you use to wash your face to remove.  It costs the same as the dept. store brands, looks better, stays put, does NOT irritate eyes or contact wearers and washes off easily.  Again, it is the BEST I have personally found.  Would NEVER go back to the others...I LOVE this stuff and I am 35 years old and have tried SO many other expensive products/brands!!!!!!",1
"Only thing I don't like is when you wash your face BIG Black chunks come off and you think you are loosing your eye lashes! However, it gets better as the mascara ages in the tube....",1
"It's pretty much just eyeshadow, or at least that's what it feels like. It smears easily. I would rate it maybe three stars, except I think the price is ridiculous.",0
"This works fine as a dry shampoo but in terms of the conditioning aspect, it definitely is lacking. I have used this brand's dry shampoo and I can't notice a difference in the products. Does not leave my hair hydrated, rather the opposite. If you're looking for something to soak up the excess oils, sure this will do the trick. But if this product is more expensive than their dry shampoo -- go for the cheaper option. This just didn't work as I expected it to.",0
Bottle was sealed but the brush was dry and the bottle empty when opened.,0
Does not taste like Ginger at all. Pretty much tastes like dollar store mint paste.,0
Very strong fragrance and leaves hair dry.,0
I got fake one too! Thanks,0
Ok brush for styling. Love these kind of brushes. Rather expensive though.,1
Completely has irrated my face and caused major puffiness to my eye area.  I think the percentage is too high for my skin.,0
"This was great and enough for a 5-7 day trip--until my friends started stealing my fancy products and used them all up!  It was convenient to buy the entire set in one kit without having to remember what to buy or pack and I thought the spray was much easier to apply than I'd expected. Smells nice, too.",1
Bought from amazon directly trying to avoid the thinness issue Id read about in the reviews fir this professional grade listed detangling leave in conditioning spray. Unfortunately after trying before shower in shower after shower on wet and dry hair and on my daughters curls it didn't help knots break down or prevent new ones from forming. It actually made our baby fine hair stuck together more left in seemingly making the knots worse even. It doesnt condition hair any better than a cheap knockoff shampoo conditioner regrettably and the smell of vanilla cakes isn't pleasant enough Id use it for s hair perfume even. Fortunately amazon takes responsibility for its products working as advertised and is refunding my debit card the full amount in a weeks worth of business days. So customer service has earned that second star but product wise this thin liquid makes a better perfume than hair detangler or conditioner,0
I love the 3/4 size and the temp control. No more smoking hair!  Easy to use and the titanium coating creates very nice shine.,1
"Unfortunately I purchased this bottle with a bottle of ""pink"" nail polish, but both colors were much duller than they appear in the photos on Amazon. The ""pink"" actually looks gray and the orange is more of a coral than the bright orange pictured here. BTW the items are not returnable so caveat emptor.",0
As expected,1
"Gooey, large particles, would not stick to my scalp. Returned product.",0
i love it,1
"This is the only shampoo that I use. If you want young looking and feeling hair this is the product to use.
Excellent seller.",1
Excellent coverage,1
Smells great but it dried my hair out!,0
"This doesn't actually seem to work. Rather it makes my hair feel brittle, weighed down, and as if there is a film on it. I'm not impressed, especially considering how much they charge. I won't be buying it again.",0
"I am meticulous about applying sunscreen, even in the winter.  I like products that serve multiple purposes, like this one.

Why I like this product:

* It goes on smoothly.

* It has SPF of 25.  I find products with 15 SPF don't provide enough protection.  The sunscreen ingredients:  homosalate (6%), octisalate (5%), octocrylene (7%) and titanium dioxide (3.75%).

* It is tinted, so it makes my skin look smooth and polished.

A big negative for me though was the strong scent of this product.  It is strong and it is very artificial.  I found it quite unpleasant after a while, especially since its on my face and close to my nose.  I gave up using this product because of that.  It is funny how scent is so personal.  Other reviewers remarked on the very light scent.  I am not usually so sensitive to scents, but this scent was very unpleasant for me.",0
"I have other products from this brand and they are good quality, however i think this particular one i got is either old or something is wrong with it. By looking at it u can tell the color separated, i had to rub the bottle in my hands to mix the color again. Once applying it it was very thick n had clumps in it. Besides this specific product the brand is excellent. I use the base coat and top gel with other colors and my nails look great for days!",0
The liquid is very thin and has to be applied several times before you can see it on the lashes.  I will stick with Kevyn Aucoin mascara.  I bought two and would like to return them and get my money back.,0
"Excellent all around, but the quantity is minute for the price.",1
"I had never seen my hair so shiny or straight after straightening it with this Babyliss the first time. I still get those results, I love it! With it, my hair withstands humidity (not just in the air but brief light rain and snow). I had to buy another one, because my sister liked it so much she kept it for herself. It makes hair flat-straight though, taking out all the volume. I LOVE IT, but the look wouldn't flatter everyone.

I do make a warning... USE THE RIGHT HEAT SETTING! If it's too low your hair won't straighten nicely, if it's too high... Your hair will literary burn. I used it to curl my hair at 460 degrees and my hair wasn't responding well because the ends are so dead... so I curled the same chunks a million times and that made my hair smell like burnt for a few days. This straightener is for real. Don't play with it!!",1
The color was too dark for me,0
It leaves the hair soft and manageable.,1
"For a bit it seemed to work. However after a few days my skind got REALLY dry and cracked, then my face broke out so terribly that I was emerassed to leave the house. Worst breakout I had in months. Not one star, though, because it DID seem to work for a bit.",0
"I thought this was going to smell really good, no scent that I can detect at all, and I anticipated some sort of soapiness or lather since it's a body wash, but there was none.  I would not buy again.",0
"One tube was fine I use this all the time and love the product it works amazing. However, one of the tubes is very liquid and watery. I just opened it today and the return/exchange window closed today. Love the product not happy with one that is watery and I have seen this problem in other reviews",0
I got the rose color and it was too brown for me.  Other colors are too light and too expensive to keep ordering when unsure of color,0
"I bought this in July and it's January now and it's dead, it will not turn on. I'm disappointed, because I use it roughly twice or three times a month and I will never buy again.",0
Very nice,1
The most fantastic nail file out there.  Keep it in the tube when not using and it will last longer than you.,1
I bought this in hopes that it would help diminish my dark spots.  I used it exactly like I was supposed to and I saw no difference in my skin.  I will not use it again.,0
Was excited but realized that the product works better on dark hair color.  The blonde hair powder has a yellow tinge and is too obvious for me to use in the front hairline due to color differences.,0
Replaces the one that I've had for years.  This one is perfect also.,1
"My facial person used this on me and I loved it ever since. It's a good change from your other daily face sunscreen. It's not too greasy, but it is kinda liquidy. The smell is nice too.",1
"i thought it was navy blue, it is purple.",0
It's a fake product.,0
"Love this product, leaves me feeling fresh and not overly scented",1
"I bleached my virgin Asian hair with Olaplex no 1 in the bleach mix, and used Olaplex no 2 after. It made absolutely no different in the process, I suspect it is fake, because I ordered the Olaplex no 3 on the official website and it did a lot more than the no 1 & 2 did, and the no 3 is supposed to be less potent than 1 & 2. Im very upset and my hair is irrevocably damaged.",0
love it,1
it not good for sensitive skin,0
"NOT the Red Door we used to get,.  It is an okay scent but not long lasting like the old Red Door.  Very disappointed.",0
"I have purchased this product due to the fact that it has some natural/organic ingredients that I hoped would not irritate my skin.  Unfortunately, it made me brake-out without any improvements over a three week period.  Since it's not suitable for my face,  I use it as a neck moisturizer just to use it up.",0
"I love the shampoo and conditioner so bought the hair shield in excitement but was so disappointed. Packaging was defective and leaked as I sprayed it on my damp hair, product hardened like hairspray and could no longer brush thru. Emailed customer service as the policy states no returns on this package, will update review once I get response.",0
Rusk spray bottle came WITHOUT the spray nozzle.  It was useless and a waste of money.  I never had any issues with any of my previous purchases of the same product in the past .  This was the first worse experience.  15$ is not much but I was disappointed,0
I love this brand just not the eyeliner it is supposed to be waterproof yet melted everyday. It was so terrible my mom told me whatever Im using STOP! A couple of embarrassing days with colleagues as my face melted as my eyeliner moved down unfortunately not happy with the product.,0
Friends with naturally curl hair have raved about the product.  It was inconvenient to wet my hair in advance before using the product.,1
didn't work for daughter,0
"I am very fair and have brown hair. After taking hormones (HRT) I developed some facial dark hair. After 4 months of weekly treating the hair (about 20 total) NO RESULTS! I called the Silk'n customer service line 3 weeks out and followed their instructions to the letter. I am using the highest setting level weekly with absolutely NO hair reduction. I kept up the treatments under the company's advice and now cannot return the product because they convinced me it would work if I gave it more time, I think that is part of the gimmick so they keep you from returning it for a refund.

Sad to say, I have been duped with this product. Watch the return period (though they say no results will occur in that time frame) or lose your money!",0
"This set up introductory oils is a three-step process. You do three steps in the morning and two at night. I did this consistently for a month, and still have approximately half of each little bottle left. I have been a 20+ year Mary Kay user, but as I hit my early 40s, I want to make sure I'm doing as much as I can to support my skin. The idea of using oils to do that is appealing. I can't say that I saw dramatic differences in my skin, but I like the way that my skin stayed hydrated and it didn't take more than a few drops of this product to cover  my face. A couple more drops for my neck.",1
Best product ever!,1
I always apply a little to my wet just washed hair.  After brushing through and blow drying it feels really soft.  My favorite part is the smell.  Its incredible ! It doesnt replace a good shampoo & conditioner but is a great leave in conditioner.  Hair feels less dry and frizzy.  Its also non greasy.,1
"Great product!  We first used this while staying at a resort in Mexico.  Really liked it and, of course, found it on Amazon!",1
"I love the design of the Helen of Troy Hot Air Brush.  But mine overheated and turned off the first time I used it, half way through doing my hair. I returned it.",0
"This is by far one of my favorite hair products. I've tried a ton of different hair products including every single American Crew styling product and Imperial won. It's very versatile. If you want no shine, make sure your hair is dry, if you want some shine, make sure your hair is a little wet, if you want a lot of shine, make sure your hair is wet.

The hold is not super strong but that's a good thing for me because I don't want to feel like it's yanking my hair out.

I've used this product to style a faux-hawk and a side part.

My only complaint would be when you are going for a complete matte look, if you decide to use a comb, it does tug on your hair but I have fairly thick but straight hair.",1
Great assortment,1
made my hair feel so thick,1
"I will keep this .. Smells so wonderful
 I will recommend this.

This is my second buying this from you guys",1
"Didnt see and feel what I read in most of the reviews, I have curly hair, not very thick but freeze. Not for me",0
smells really watered down.  had to return it.,0
"Disappointed,  left my hair flat",0
"Previously I had been using Dreadnought/Bluebeard's Revenge which was good, but a bit pricey and then I moved onto the Poraso red (bowl), which was cheaper and lasted a long time. This time I'm trying out the Poraso blue (tube).  Initial impressions are that the lather is pretty thick, certainly thicker than the Poraso red in the bowl, I chalk this up to the form factor, you can use a cream in a tube to get a thicker lather more easily than you can with a puck or semi-solid soap. The smell for the blue isn't the best IMHO. The red smells of sandlewood, which I find pleasing. The blue smells a bit like Ivory with a medicinal scent add in. The smell isn't very appealing IMHO.  However as shaving cream it does perform well. I might try the white or green next time and see how those stack up.",1
"The BEST -- texture, hold, and saves a wash like none other. I use it for styling from day one and usually don't have to wash my mid-length hair more than twice a week!",1
Makes your eyelids feel very smooth and wrinkle free.  You can wear it alone or put on eyeshadow and see a beautiful flawless lid.  Takes 10 years off your eyelids. The only thing that was disappointing was that the tube is quite small.,1
Works well and so much better than having to drag my two kids out to the store. Love my prime,1
"I haven't noticed a change in my skin, but I also haven't been using it for too long so I cant really judge on the effectiveness of the product..however, I will not be repurchasing solely based on the fact that it feels like I cant wash it off. Even after a ton of rinsing, it still feels like there's soap on my face and I hate that feeling.",0
Please refund or repace. The lavender  color on the pump is flaking off and mixing with the ingredients thus all on one's face.,0
great product,1
"I glanced at a few reviews before starting my own because I was curious what others thought. Perception of scent is really up to the individual and of course how that scent interacts with your own body chemistry. I was expecting a more fruity fragrance, but it didn't seem that way on my skin. For me, this was a heavy almost cloying smell and unlike a few other reviewers, I did not have any issues with the scent fading.

I am rating it 4 stars because I get compliments wearing it and my husband likes how it smells :)",1
I had a lot of friends referred this product to me and unfortunately it did not work for me. It would consistently run to my face or send even a drugstore brand would. Im going to switch to something else.,0
Dries hair in half the time as a regular hair dryer. Works great.,1
This is refreshing and quite lovely smell.,1
"I could barely give this product a one star rating.  It is thick, ugly, and hard to apply.  I've never had a product react as this does.  Not what I expected and sorry, can't give any kind of recommendations.",0
"Made my hair worst. I have natural curly hair,which turns dry all the time. So I brought this. After I use it everything seem ok, till later during the day my hair did a 180 and is now all puff and frizzy and completely unmanageable. Can't believe I can't get my money back. 30 dollars in the garbage. I guess I'll keep looking for something that works.",0
I was very excited when I got this curling iron! It heats up in about a minute and it gives you perfect curls. The cord is long and it does not tangle much.,1
Good product with a terrible dispenser. After one use the push pump disengaged from the bottle and the clear plastic protective cap is too large thus preventing reattachment. Very stupid design. Will return.,0
"Great product as promised!!Works wonderful on fine, thin hair in a high humidity! Does not weigh the hair down. Smells great too!",1
The color was not really showing even though I tried to put more layers. Not sure if I got the real one because OPI used to stay on easily and show colors. Disappointed.,0
So far it seems to be working.  I have almost used the whole jar.  I just bought a second one.  Better than most.,1
"Even when I use mega hold products, my hair doesn't hold the curls. I have to recurl my hair about 4 hours later.",0
"I had Japanese hair straighten  2 years ago, it made my hair straight and soft , I tried Bio Ionic for the root , I followed the instructions exactly ,
Apply Cream 1 for 30 minutes , rinse , dry , iron , apply cream 2 for 7 minutes , rinse , dry , iron , no wash for 3 days

My hair came up straight and soft but only last for 3 weeks after that my hair curl is back

How I get "" straight hair "" to last  forever as the product details; it will last forever "" only need to do the root"";

what do I need to change in the processing to make it last

Thank you",0
"Same as the rest of Rodial's products I have tried. Nothing special. My lips were actually dry after the first few uses, but after about the third use seemed same as regular lip stuff. I use my burts bees more often than this expensive lip stuff. Would not buy again.",0
This deodorant has a very good smell and also looks real nice.  I just wish it would work as an antiperspirant!,0
"Nice stuff but the brush is a bit long for its diameter, causing it to be too floppy when wet.",1
This is a nice cream that spreads out over my skin so only a tiny bit is needed.  It is softening and smoothing but does not make a visible difference in wrinkles.  My skin feels very soft from the but I can't see a difference.  It has a pleasant mild scent.,1
"I have previously purchased this product on amazon and was so happy with it that when I ran out I re-ordered. This re-order came from the supplier ""bare vanity"" which was different than my first time order. This time the product is not as silky and now after using it for about a week, either the pump is broken or the bottle is empty. I no longer have my receipt so I'm now out 28.00 and I'm not happy........so buyer beware",0
Be careful if you purchase this cream to try and combat wrinkles.  I am 48 and I have sensitive skin. I used it just like the directions said and my skin swelled up so bad it looked like I was deformed! I had to stop using the cream and my skin did go back to normal after 3 days thankfully but it was horrible to go through that.  They did refund my money after I called so I had no problem with that part. Just be very careful and DO NOT BUY if you have sensitive skin.,0
"Works well over time to remove lines. I have found if I use this product in the AM and PM daily, my lips are smoother",1
It was perfect!,1
Ty,1
Not as amazing as I thought it would be but I do like that it's easy to travel with and easier to keep clean and doesn't need batteries or a recharge all the time. Wish lavender was available.,1
good quality just one thing heavy must be use by men.,1
I usually wear Lacoste red sport. I decided to try this one. I love it especially during the first part of the day. Not overpowering or pungent. It doesn't last the entire day though. Plenty of compliments.,1
This is your typical silicone face primer. However I do not find it fills in lines and pores at all. It just gives your foundation a smooth base to go over. However I have pores and this did nothing for them AT ALL. Didn't really work for me. However if you have oily skin this might be good for you as I noticed it did absorb oil decently.,0
Not the real thing. Broke me out,0
This does not seem to be the same product I get at the beautiy salons.,0
"I LOVE THIS STUFF, I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT 30 YEARS NOW, AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND THAT IT WAS STILL AVAILABLE, AND AT A GOOD PRICE THANK YOU.",1
It left white residue on my face that is quite visible. It did not blend well with my daily clear face moisturizer. It was a waste of money as I stopped using it after 4 attempts.,0
I love this product.  I got it after asking a lady what she uses because her skin was so beautiful.,1
"The product didn't have the lid coming along with. And it looks CHEAP, dirty, without any seal. I guess someone used it before or even it is the fake one. Feel like I were tricked by the seller. Don't know why I bought it from this seller.
*******
NOT RECOMMEND",0
Super dark teal & love it! Lasts a few days b4 chips/wear,1
Doesn't rub in and the ingredients separate.,0
"This works great on my skin. Forehead line appears lessened with use and it is light enough to use during the day. Wish it were more travel friendly but we cant have everything we want, can we?",1
Love this scent.,1
"I didn't purchase my Butter London 3 free nail lacquer from Amazon, but I know that, like myself, a lot of people come here for reviews. The 3 free concept is wonderful, the price, high, and the end result, meh. For me the pro was that it dried very quickly. However, it didn't last. I did my nails last night, and after my shower this morning, they had all chipped. I'm sorry, but for that price, I'd like my polish to last longer.",0
"This hair straightener from LumaBella is a very effective and easy to use device.  I found the results were actually better than other similar straighteners with regards to medium thick curls.  The device comes with two tubes of their own oil to use with their mist function and they load directly into the device.  You can use water instead if you like.  The device heats up fairly quickly and it's about average in the speed department.

This is an aesthetically pleasing device that looks like an offshoot of of an apple product.  Would be great as a gift item.",1
"I'm not in love with this scent the way I am Warm Cotton. It's softer, but I don't think it smells much like laundry. My boyfriend likes it, but he's not the one who has to smell it all day (not that it lasts all day). I think it kind of over-powers the smell of other perfumes when I try to layer. It's alright, but I probably won't order it again, based on personal preference.",1
"I have really dry skin, so I was expecting that this might dry it out, but it does nothing. I've used this and other Jan Marini products for almost two years now and have noticed no changes. I think I will just find some less expensive products since it seems I'm spending my money for nothing with this and the other Marini products. At least I won't be spending so much if they don't work.",0
"The product is kind of messy,  but after a few trial and errors and a lot of clean up I manage for it to look good in my hair.",1
"I have ordered this product before and have purchased at a stores . All of them have a expiration dated on them , The two I just got do not have an expiration . this is a concern they may be out of date and/ or  the date was removed or so old no date . Not sure  what i should ?",0
I love it...,1
This product broke me out.  So I had to return it.,0
"The product worked great, but the second time I used it the brush fell off.  Bummer. I'm going to try and glue a brush onto
the lid and hope it works.",1
"Nice fuschia pink color, good for summer",1
"Couldn't detect much akin to roses in this scent, disappointedly.  Not a fragrance I would purchase again.",0
Covers up hair loss from Alopecia and allows me to wear my hair down for the first time in years.  Thank you Toppik!,1
"This is more of a smoothing iron than a curling iron. It will turn the ends under, but if you are wanting curls you should go with the 1 1/2 inch.",1
my fave,1
nice and shinny but does not last a week,1
"As with most anti-aging products, what you get is deflated hope and a thinner wallet.  While I like this lotion as a lotion, it did no long-term good in terms of volumizing the skin on my hands, reducing that crepe-like look, etc.  There was some improvement in the texture of my skin when I first applied the lotion, perhaps more improvement than is provided by other products, but it did not last.  Wash your hands and the benefit is gone.  Due to the expense of this product and the minimal, temporary results it delivers, I would not recommend it.",0
This isn't real. I had a sample before and I could smell it all day. This for $135 definitely isn't lasting. Very upsetting I should have known not to buy on here. ,0
"I used to have clarisonic but decided to upgrade since this seems to be the newest thing out there. I thought it will be better, unfortunately my blackheads came back and my skin is just not as clean and clear since I started using it.  The only good thing about it is that the battery lasts for a few months after being charged.  It is definitely not worth the money that I paid for it and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is looking to keep their skin clean.",0
"Bought it on August, second time use it today, it looks terriable on nails, the texture is very watery.",0
"The curling iron can not be used outside the US, it would have been nice to have this detail prior to purchases. I was disappointed.",0
GREAT PRODUCT WORKS VERY WELL FOR WOMEN. I AM SO AMAZED BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS STRUGGLED WITH INGROWN HAIRS ON THE FACE.,1
Arrived on time and a lovely scent.,1
"What an annoying product. One has to really squeeze hard to get any spray to come out and fluid is leaking out from under the white plastic collar beneath the nozzle. And this crap expensive, besides.",0
I did a lot of research on blow dryers before I purchased this one and boy am I glad I did. This dryer blew my daughter thick curly hair dry as a cracker in less than ten minutes. I used this dryer to do her Brazilian keratin and it came out just purrfect. Would totally recommend this dryer to anyone and the two year warranty is an added plus,1
"Good clean, light hold. Just what I was looking for.  Doesn't leave that greased look",1
"Not toppik brand , I received a rembli hair fiber can instead. The price differences on these brands are bothersoom, rembli is cheaper and looks to be a generic hair fiber product..",0
Best sunscreen ever,1
As described,1
Very pleased with this for the price. Doesn't leave a residue on pillows in the night or leave skin flaky and drive. Great for small blackheads.,1
"This review has to do with the delivery/packaging of the product.  When I received the item, it came in a mailer envelope which was slightly torn and had a little bit of the shampoo already seeping out of the envelope.  When I opened the envelope, the shampoo had spilled all over the inside and the entire bottle was slippery from the shampoo.  I'd recommend some better packaging for this to ensure there is no spillage.",0
Love the smell and love the moisture it provides.,1
"I love this flat iron. I had Paul Mitchell in the past and was worried since they discontinued the model I had. This one works better, heats up faster and cools off almost immediately after turning it off",1
Starts to smell after 2-3 days,0
Some of my favorite stuff!  I spoil myself with this.,1
Just what I expected.  Great product.,1
The eyeshadow came broken. Extremely disappointed with the product.,0
Did not tan me like tan towels from HSN...feel they have been sitting  on a shelf  for a long time...or they weakened formula...very disappointed being I bought 3 boxes.,0
"Love it. With tons of hair and frizz, this is by far the smoothest I have gotton my hair with Babybliss.",1
Love this product!  Great Seller!!,1
"Wonderful scent but it does not last all day. Nevertheless, it lasts for several hours. I tried the intense version at the store and they smell similarly. I'll try that one next time to ascertain it's longevity.",1
"I've used pretty much every tanning product on the market because I refuse to go in a tanning bed. Hands down, this is the best fake tan on the market. It's not going to give you an extremely dark tan unless you are religious about re-applying all the time, but it will give you a great all over natural looking tan. The only negative is that the towels do dry fast, so make sure you apply fairly quickly. Once on, your skin will dry in no time, so you don't have to worry about getting it on your sheets or clothes. I re-apply the towels about every few days or so. They are more pricey than your drug store tanning options, but the results are definitely worth the price!",1
$55 what are you kidding me??? Buy it online store Crabtree & Evelyn for $18 - ONLY $18,0
"The product seems pretty. But it came completely crumbled into dust. I can still apply the dust I guess,  but it's a powdery mess.  I was going to put it in my makeup bag but if it accidentally opens I would end up with 26 dollars worth of pink dust everywhere.",0
"Love the adjustability of the temperature, that it does the winding (either direction), and the way it makes my hair look! Wish it took a little bit bigger chunk of hair as my hair is super thick and it takes me awhile to get it all wavy - really the only reason I gave it a 4 rather than a 5!",1
"Didn't stay on, too waxy, nice color",0
This Philip B. White Truffle Ultra-Rich Moisturizing Shampoo is very good products. With a lot of nutritions it repairs my hair with daily wash. You can cover the herb smell by using other conditioner.,1
"So, I read all of the positive ratings and decided to give this product a shot.  I have been using it since September 2013, so roughly 6 months or so.  I have seen absolutely zero results.  Nothing is happening.  Nada.  I follow the directions and use it morning and evening on a clean face and have seen no sign of improvement with any of the lines in my face (crows feet and forehead).  Incredibly disappointed.  The only reason that I gave it two stars instead of one is because it is a good moisturizer but I could have b9ought a moisturizer from wally world for over one hundred dollars less.  Glad that some of you have had better results.  I do wonder how much of it is placebo?
But for me it was a  total waste...",0
"I really think that this is not the real product. I was so excited to try it after reading great reviews and I was shocked at how gross and strongly perfumed it was when I used it! It also didn't do anything to my hair as far as making it smoothe and feel healthier! Totally not was I expected for a product I read such great things on. After a few months on on and off use (because it makes my hair feel dry and smells horrible) it occurred to me that it's probably not the real product! After coming back on here and reading some similar reviews, I feel duped. I'm going to go to Ulta and check out the color and smell. I would not recommend buying on here.",0
Works great to smooth frizzy hair and way easier than a curling iron or straightener. Only thing I would add is an automatic shut off.,1
"Love this product, but wish it wasn't so expensive.",1
"I have used this product for years, but this item does not have the scent, consistancy, or quality of Achipelago Botanicals.",0
doesn't seem like it helps my hair. Comparing Amoka mask is working much better than shampoo or conditioner,0
This is an excellent product for lightening the dark eye circles. I received sample packs from my dermatologist and I loved the results.,1
"It was a gift, my husband seemed to like it.",1
"I like this polish.  I want to buy more, but the reviews are so mixed on this $15 bottle.  if you sign up on the butter website, they do send offers for 20%-50% off of the polish.  Just depends on time of year.",1
"I used it twice and it died. Put it on charge for 24 hours,and still nothing. I live overseas so it is very expensive to return. I will never buy from this vendor again. complete ripoff",0
"Very nice travel straightening iron. The size is perfect for getting up close to my roots and giving my hair some lift while it straightens. It heats up quickly and is perfect for my shoulder length, fine, fly-away hair.

I would highly recommend this item to someone with a similar hair type to mine. However, I'm not sure if this would be ideal for someone who has thicker hair or extremely long hair due to the size/width of the iron.",1
"I have natural curly afroam hair (type 4abc) I get about 4-5 uses from this tiny bottle. Cant lie the somewhat high price hurts but the stuff works. Hair is lightened honey color, began breaking SO MUCH. Got #1&2 done @ salon & I purchased #3 to use between visits. I use twice/month & salon visits every 3ish months. Definitely noticed a difference within 1st month.",1
good rollers! The rollers wear down after about three years of daily use.,1
"I wouldn't consider this a gift as opposed to just a box of leftover/discard products, few of which I will use.",0
"I love the product, the only bad part is comes with soo little product and there's no way to find out how much of it stuck.",1
I'm sorry. I buy a lot stuff. But I don't feel brighter skin. Not good. I don't believe and I don't buy no more ,0
i purchased this product because my colorist suggested it - but i used twice and did not like it.  Made my hair feel sticky and heavy.  i'm thinking of returning it because i know i won't use it again and the bottle is full.,0
"Fantastica, idratante, ottima .",1
"I made the mistake of buying this without first sneaking a sniff of it in the store. The scent is really overpowering and earthy/woodsy, exactly like a cheap, men's cologne or deodorant. It smelled so bad I didn't even want to put it on my head, but being that I bought it, I thought I should probably use it at least once. Well, I wasn't at all impressed with the results, either. My hair was left feeling really dry and damaged. I also made the mistake of not reading the ingredients before buying this, as the main ingredient (the second ingredient, next to water) is Dimethicone. I guess Klorane hasn't ""gotten the memo"" that Dimethicone is bad for hair. I dislike this stuff so much that I don't even want to give it away. So into the garbage it goes.",0
"not bad, trying it out for the first time",1
Horrible,0
"I love this curler - I just wish it lasted longer without breaking. I've used this brand for several years, but they usually need replacing every 3-4 months.",1
very pretty color,1
This product is a poor excuse as a replacement to their previous conditioning balm. Did the company even compare the products? I do not see how that would have happened without the influence of massive amounts of psychoactive drugs.,0
Nice,1
My new favorite cleanser,1
"Daughter has fine, super curly hair. This DID NOT detangle at all. AWFUL product.",0
"Disappointed, too sticky.",0
"This is a tint but it provides great coverage. It is smooth and goes on as easy as a lotion and doesn't settle into tiny lines. Finish with a loose powder and it's a great natural look, especially for those of us a little older!",1
"Fake products from this seller! I've used Pureology loyalty for 15+ yrs & purchased from salons, Amazon, eBay, etc. I purchased a set of 33oz hydrate shampoo & conditioner & this hydrate spray in conditioner 'color fanatic', all from this seller despite a few questionable reviews when i ordered in December. HUGE mistake! This seller is selling fake products. Bottles & labels look almost identical except for a slightly different shade on the bottles although not noticeable enough to really throw me off initially. Now that I've opened the bottles, they all have a different texture, consistency, smell & feel than authentic Pureology. I've purchased Pureology products many times for years on Amazon (from other sellers) & this was the first time I've been ripped off with fake Pureology products. Be extra cautious because upon further research & calling Amazon today to file a formal complaint, this seller is selling under multiple accounts & listings. Amazon will be investigating this seller & hopefully protecting buyers from further dishonesty from this seller. I wish i would've taken the advice of the negative reviews in December on this seller.",0
Best price,1
"This is a fake. Do not buy this product on Amazon, only buy from the GrandeLash website directly. I used this ONE time and the next morning it looked like I had been crying all night; horribly itchy bloodshot eyes and puffiness. I was self conscious at work and even my boyfriend asked me if my eyes were ok, he didn't even know I used a new product.",0
"this is economy model it works but don't expect much chrome plating is thin handle is brass but its thin and very light razor has no weight to it

i have two edwin js and they are 3 times better than this model",0
"Oh boy, my aging skin loves this!  Very light but buildable coverage.  F30 is perfect and I am very fair with pink undertones.  Doesn't creep into fine lines or turn greasy on my normal skin.  I get many compliments.  Try a sample first from Ulta and then order online.  Be cautious, I recently ordered thru Amazon and got a very old product that had oxidized (it was in different packaging, my first clue). Returned for a prompt refund.  The package u see here is the most current.  Love the environmentally conscious pouch that also let's you utilize every drop. I wear it every day, usually with a Loreal or MakeupForever powder and it lasts at least six months.  Has never made my middle aged peri meno skin break out, unlike other products loaded with silicone derivatives.  Love it and hope it is never discontinued.  Switched from a Clinique product I'd been using for 20 years and couldn't be happier. If you don't need heavy coverage give it a try.  Bet you'll love it, too.

Update on 11/28/2014:  Found that now the Kohl's stores with the higher end makeup carry Cargo.  Unfortunately, Cargo changed the formula and in doing so the colors have totally changed.  What was F30 and perfect for my complexion is now at least 3 levels darker and has a VERY orange undertone.  The two lighter shades are also much more yellow/orange.  I've called and emailed Cargo customer service but never got a reply.  I understand from reading comments on various sites that they removed the parabens (a preservative) and in doing so all of the colors have changed.  Back to Clinique.",0
"I was actually quite disappointed with this product. With the hot tools brand name I was sure it would be high temp and create a great curl - no such thing. It's also not gentle on hair.. it catches tiny hairs and plucks them out, ouch! I've had better curl from drug store irons. Choose another!",0
It appears to be the same product by the out side of the container. It does not feel like the Ahava lotion I usually get. It is still lotion...but I would not pay this much for it again.,0
"I bought this curling iron in February, less than three months ago and suddenly it will not heat up at all. I am so disappointed. I bought this curling iron to use on my daughter's hair, and I typically used it for just 10 minutes a day to fix her hair before school. Nothing out of the ordinary has happened to it, I just went to use it several days ago and found that it would not heat up. The light comes on but it does not get hot. I have used this brand in the past and loved it so I expected the same quality that I grew to love before. My previous curling iron in this brand lasted for years. So very disappointed.",0
DOSE NOT WORK,0
Quick shipment. Just as described. Highly recommend.,1
My Daughter used some of the polish and Lacquer at her Mother-In-Laws and thought it was good so I ordered some. It didn't work well for me and I would like to return it.,0
Thanks everyone for all those reviews.  I was set to order some Strivectin and after reading ALL the reviews I think I'll pass on it.  Having you gals offer such not-so-glowing reviews sends up a warning flag most of us should listen to!!,0
"Pevonia is my product of choice.
Buying here is cheaper than buying from salon.
Excellent moisturizer and does reduce shine/breakthrough of oil from my combination skin.
My skin feels better and looks better when I use moisturizer.  Its noticeable when I don't.
Have used product more than 5 years.",1
I hate it its not plumimg  at all,0
"I like this product compare to the one i was using. it leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturize, and it doesn't get oily throughout the day.i have only used it for two weeks so I haven't seen any drastic results toward my acne. the only thing I didn't like was that i broke out but but it wasn't serious is starting to go away.",1
I like this product a lot and will continue to order it.  Much cheaper to order on line than buy it at my salon.,1
"I got this polish to last for 1 week once. Ever since then, I can't get it to go without chipping for one day straight.",0
"One word....ouch!!  I let the curlers heat up on the ""high"" setting for approximately 5-7 minutes, until the 'dot' in the center of the curler turned white, per the written instructions with the product.  The curlers were so hot that they blistered the tips of my fingers!  I've used dozens of different hot roller sets, and this is a first. I'll give them a try on the 'low' setting to see if they're worth the hassle, but based on first impression, I would not recommend.",0
"It's ok, nothing spectacular.",0
This is a wonderful scent!,1
"The most interesting aspect of this body scrub is the feeling that it leaves on the skin.  Typical soaps rid the skin of oil and leave it with a tightness or astringency that might make one want to moisturize afterwards.  This scrub, however, leaves the skin feeling clean yet moisturized at the same time.  Admittedly, that characteristic took a bit of getting used to.  It's not objectionable, just different.

With regard to the fragrance--sweet orange and cedar wood--I couldn't say with certainty that it did or did not smell like what's on the label, but I did like the scent along with its potency.  A welcome change.

The consistency of the scrub is reminiscent of white sugar combined with a water-oil solution . . . but the sugar doesn't dissolve.  Good to use on a weekend after doing yard work all day and you're looking for a spa moment when cleaning up.",1
Battery dies after awhile and Clarisonic refuses to replace or repair it. You can't replace the battery yourself because it's sealed in such a way to prevent water from entering the compartment. Customer service doesn't care and basically tells you eat it and buy a new one. Stay far away.,0
"I have been using this scent for at least 10 years and was happy to find it on line since it has been discontinued.  As soon as I sprayed it though,  I realized that this was a totally different scent, was very strong, and cheap smelling.  Amazon immediately gave me a credit and did not ask for the bottle back (I guess I can try to find someone that might like whatever is in the bottle).",0
"Perhaps my wrinkles need an anti-depressant?  I've been using this on my forehead faithfully since I got it, and I don't notice any change in the appearance of my ""expression lines.""

It's tempting to try these things out and fortunately, I got to do that for free.  If I'd paid the price for this cream, I'd probably earn a new ""expression line.""",0
I've been using this lip gloss for years now and it never disappoints.,1
"It works well as a makeup setting spray, but it made the skin on my body feel dry and sticky and break out. Acne on the body is beautiful because it is rare, but I did not expect this product to give me acne all over my body.",0
"The polish I received looks nothing like the one shown for sale. It looks more similar to Essie's ""Play Date."" This was also the first time I've purchased nail polish online. Lesson learned: stick to purchasing polish in person.",0
This has not met my expectations at all.,0
The package was damage..I need a return label ..,0
Disappointed!!! The curls didn't last at all not even 5 mins!!! Wish I could return and get my money back,0
"It is so nice to enter a room and hear others comment about what a wonderful scent they smell. Well, you will get this every single time with Pink Sugar by Aquolina.

I do not like heavy scents or those that can become 'unpleasant' while wearing them. Pink Sugar reacts in such a way that it is refreshing, yummy and delicious.

For those who want to bring pleasure through the senses, I highly recommend Pink Sugar.

I like this hairdryer. Well made.,1
"I have used many hair products throughout my life to do that little flip thing in the front of my hair. I like this for when my hair is at its intermediate length (1.5"" or so) it holds pretty much throughout the entire day and doesn't leave any sort of residue or flake. My only qualm is that, unlike some of the other products i've used, if its super humid out, it doesn't hold up too well, but thats probably to be expected.",1
too expensive and packaging was very very poor. Was expecting a decent size container with nice soaps. When I opend the pack I was shocked. All the soap was broken and can't even see the shapes.,0
I am using this oil for an itchy scalp. It works well and takes the itch away. Will buy it again.,1
"I've been using this cream for 7 years and this is a first time I am dissatisfied with it.  The smell and consistency is not the same. It is not as thick and reach,the color is lighter,smells different. I am convinced it's a fake. VERY disappointed! Will never buy from this seller again!",0
"Too sweet, I don't like it",0
"Guys, there is so much fragrance in this product. It works well, but the scent is so powerful it gives me a massive headache. Just a heads up!",0
This product no longer heats after using maybe 10 times.,0
Dermablend's liquid camo foundation goes on easily. It provides great coverage without feeling caked on. The manufactor recommends finishing with their setting spray. I was a bit put out that a second product was needed to achieve the advertised results.,1
"Truly amazing results! Undetectable, even up close! If this was waterproof for 24-hours it would by perfect. Drawbacks: cost, hair must by dry to apply, and fibers can be inhaled during application. But it must be worth it, because I have been using for 9 months.",1
"As someone who shaves 5-6 times a week (both head and face), I've been through a lot of razors in 25 years. I've done all the regular production ones and have been using the Harrys blades for a couple years. I was looking for something that was a little reliably closer, reasonably cheap and easy to use/maintain...I decided to try a DE/Safety razor. This one appeared to be a good fit. Regularly recommended as a 'beginner' razor for DE users, it has good general reviews and theoretically falls in the middle of how aggressive it is. For me this probably isn't quite aggressive enough.

After a week of shaving, I've had no cuts or burn (that's the good part!), the bad part is that it takes some real work to get as close a shave as I was getting with Harry's or other mass produced razors. While people say 'let the weight of the razor do the work' I find that unless I apply pressure, I can't get that close with it. That goes for; with the grain, against it, and across it. The stock Merkur blade that came with it rates as not that sharp. After 4 uses I switched out to an Astra blade which is nominally sharper, but I feel like I'm still not getting as close a shave as I should. I'm going to try Feather blades next and also consider a more aggressive headed blade for experimentation.",1
"This product is a waste of your money, it does not add any valume to your hair. It does leave your hair with a nice smell but that was not the reason why I bough it .  I get more value in my hair with  Pantene for a quarter of the price.",0
"I have struggled for years with my uneven skin tone, n recently had issues with my face feeling dry & tight after having a bath. This product has rejuvenated my skin & now my skin tone is visibly evening out, after using the product for under 2 months. It is definitely workin for me. Hope is does the same for u",1
"Coconuts and Cabanas- nice rich neutral colors that go on even and blend well. The case is nice and solid with a good weight that does not feel cheap.  I love the mirror size, too.  Some have commented on the lack of an applicator but I would not have used it anyway (I prefer a brush) so it did not bother me.  This was my first time using Julep and it was a good experience.  I usually prefer a more matte finish but otherwise a good solid choice.",1
"My hair stylist told me that it's the best, so I took his advise. I bought it. On the internet, it claims that it's brand new in the box. I was a little upset when I see the product, I found finger prints all over the ironer. It had water stains on it. The electrical wires were dirty, seems like the product had been used and dragged on the floor. However, I'm was amazed how good this ironer can actually do. I can say that it is the best one I ever own. I just got my hair perm few months ago, but kind of got sick and tired of it. It doesn't pull my hair, very smooth, but it creates tons of smoke. The reason I give it 2 stars because the seller sent me a used product which they claim to be new. But I will give this ironer a 5 stars. If this ironer isn't that good, I would have return it already.",0
"If you have dark skin beware. This product doesn't absorb well. It will leave white marks under your eyes, no matter how hard you try to blend.",0
Todo ok,1
"This lotion goes on nicely in the AM but by early afternoon my face is painfully dry, to the point where I feel like my skin will crack if I smile. I hate being the only negative review but maybe my skin is having a reaction to this lotion. At a minimum I would say this lotion is not for dry skin. I'm 50, BTW.",0
"Easy to use, great covering of grow out.",1
"I got this from kohls with Kohls cash and only paid about $15 out of pocket. For that price, yes - this is a good product. The lip wash is weird and unnecessary. The scrub is okay, I like my VS one better. The plumper, eh and the balm seems good. I wouldn't pay the whole price of $45 for this set.",0
Wonderful scent that lasts longer than most...I always want it to last forever! I think this will become 'his scent'!,1
So far I Haven't noticed any big difference.  I've used it every night for the past month.,0
I think I like the green flavor more,1
"Gotta say I read what the scent was and I was quite excited, but when I got it and smelled it... whoa man that was bad. I still shaved with it in case it was one that need to break in and see if the lather and post shave feel where there (those were I will say). That smell was just to much to get passed. Going to try the Green (menthol) and Red (sandalwood) here at some point.",0
"I've used this shaver a couple of times now while in the tub. I am very pleased with how close it shave for an electric shaver....and no, you are not going to get a razor close shave with this, but it is good for what it is. I shaved both my legs and armpits with this shaver. I liked how it shaved my legs, but not so much my armpits. This shaver had a had time handling the curves of my armpits and therefore I was unable to use it for that and is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I also used it to ""trim"" and I was also happy with the results of that. I had no bumpy irritation spots after using it. Overall, I like it and will use it when I shave most of the time.",1
"Works well, but not as well as I had hoped",1
"It made really strange looking curls. Especially is your hair has just a couple of barely wet pieces. I like natural looking curls but it made them so curly that you can't shake them out. Instead of making the curls looser it makes your hair super poofy. Do not brush your hair after curling. Son people find that brushing your curls makes it look good but it doesn't! If you want super bouncy, tight curls get this but if you want looser, mermaids etc curls get something else",0
"This product does take a bit of getting used to. I discovered this after trying some of my mother's. A little bit is really all that's needed (I have fairly long curly hair). It is a bit tacky/stringy when taking from the jar, however, once rubbed between hands, warmed up, and dispersed through my hair (I use it when my hair is wet), it does provide soft hold that allows for movement. It seems to also help my hair retain moisture and beat the hot and humid summer days. It does have a slightly residual feel to it, which is why I gave it 4 stars, some people may not like this. I still use it.",1
"Have to agree with the others who gave this only 1 star, it's useless.  So small and awkward,  the base is not curved to match the natural curve of you eyelid so if you do manage to grab a few lashes and try to curl them, they most likely will be more straight than before you attempted.  I too believe I lost a few lashes using this curler - don't waste your money on this one.",0
It really does help fine lines,1
"This dryer was great until it broke last week. When I plug it in and try to use it, it has an AWFUL screeching sound and it sounds like it is broken. I tried blowing it out in the back, shaking it, and cannot get rid of this awful sound. I only blowdry my hair a few times a week and I bought it in December. Cannot believe Amazon is not letting me return this; this is absurd.",0
"I like licorice. The flavor goes good with coffee I think. This Amarelli Licorice Mint has a tiny hint of licorice flavor, maybe, but a fire hose of mint obliterates it. Back to Toms Fennel

"Good Iron, definitely NOT for curling. I have medium length wavy frizzy hair. This iron straightens it out adding volume and shine with a nice natural look. Definitely works if thats the look you're going for.",1
"LOVE this brush.. I have one and frankly my old still in good shape i just fell it was time for a new one.  I'm still using my old one but keeping this one for the  future. This brush can go on for years to come.. will not buy any other brand, best brush thus far!",1
my favorite! I have been using it for over 10 years and I took a short break and now I am back at it...love it!,1
"I bought a Solano in 2012 and it broke after 2 years.  I replaced it with a new one, but the second also died after two years.  I definitely expected a longer life for such an expensive hairdryer.",0
Do not buy this product it's awful!! There's no color at all doesn't apply on the nails,0
"I have really dry skin, so I was expecting that this might dry it out, but it does nothing. I've used this and other Jan Marini products for almost two years now and have noticed no changes. I think I will just find some less expensive products since it seems I'm spending my money for nothing with this and the other Marini products. At least I won't be spending so much if they don't work.",0
"Love this product for my natural hair. Provides shine, moisture and strength.",1
"Nice color but a little too light for me.  It has sparkles in it too, which I did not know.  U might like and u might not.",0
I like it.,1
"Very pretty gloss bar, feels just like a chapstick. Great color and love the design of the container.",1
"Too expensive for what it does. I have mild bumpy rosacea and this product made no difference in my skins appearance and is very expensive. Products that work for me for rosacea are: Topix Glycolix zinc sunscreen, Mario Badesco Aloe Vera Toner, La Roche Posay Toleriane cleanser, nutiva organic coconut oil, and replenix power of three cream--which is the most helpful of all. Listing the products here in case they can help someone else. I have tried bazillions of products and this current mix for me works. Cleanser, toner, power of three cream (let it dry), then sunscreen in day time or coconut oil at night time.",0
"Not bad, but I would like it stiffer. I have very fine hair and prefer something very stiff to keep it in place.  I use liberal amounts of hairspray once I have my hair in place.",1
I love this Vitamin C  cream it nourishes the skin it enhances your complexion.,1
"great stuff, but only works if your razor blade is also constantly replaced. I tried re-using the same razor as long as I could, but this doesn't compensate for that lol. Just maintain your razor and it will do as it was intended.",1
"Okay well my mom bought me this curling iron and it came a day before Christmas, which was cool because I thought ""sweet i can curl my hair for christmas!"" I have thickish hair, about 4 inches past my shoulders more or less, and its naturally wavy and sort of gets frizzy after a shower. I figured I could use this curling iron to shape up my waves after a shower so they look polished and sleek. Well unfortunately this was absolutely NOT what I was expecting. When I tried curling my hair I had to turn it up waaay high because anything lower than about 360 just made my hair straight with a rlly ugly flip at the end. So i realized i had to hold this thing to my head for at least a minute if not more to get a curl. And another thing - the curl doesn't look good! It gets a crimp mark where the curl begins on your head, and its shapen all wrong and tight-looking.  Not to mention it gets real boring sitting there holding this monster 5 pound piece of metal-ceramic whatever waiting for a curl that burns the side of your neck and looks like some uptight rope attatched to your head. This thing can barely even straighten right, which is pretty sad. I don't know if the other reviewers just got lucky with theirs or I just got the malfunctioned one but I wouldn't recommend this curling iron to my worst enemy. I've tried using this multiple times and even my friends have tried but it is not working, it didn't work for them either. Except my one friend who got her bangs to look real nice with it, I'm very disappointed with the outcome.",0
Love this set too.,1
"I thought I would go back to the 'ol time, double edge shaving. I like the JB line. But after several weeks of shaving with this item, I gave up and went back to the 5 blade razor: Gellette. And the 5 blade get me a better, closer, longer lasting shave, hands down. Sorry guys, you gotta move ahead with a much better razor. Gotta keep up with the time. larry",0
Does seem as to last as long  As department store,0
I love this powder!,1
"This dryer replaced my worn out CHI and was purchased at the recommendation of my stylist.  The cool setting is a great feature and the heat dries my long, thick hair in about 20 minutes and thanks to the Ionic feature, the heat isn't too hot and doesn't have the damaging over drying effect.  I purchased a cheaper dryer after the CHI and before this one that didn't have the Ionic feature and it was amazing the damage to my hair after just 2 weeks of using it; I will never have a dryer without it again.  I am still getting used to the button placements on the new dryer being on the side of the handle, but it's not a problem.  Overall, a great dryer especially for the price.",1
"The scent was of a mans shampoo.
Did not like it.",0
"The mild scent and quality formulation place this at the top of the Proraso lineup. The Green menthol is a little too strong for my taste, and the Red sandalwood still has a hint of eucalyptus. The new Blue aloe is the best of the three.",1
"So good! I get beautiful curls with this but not crispy. My curls are soft and fluffy but defined.  I feel my hair dries faster than with the heavier deva curl gel I was using before.  This is a small bottle, especially for the price, but it lasts a long time.  I bought mine mid november and using it 4-5x a week (I only get my hair wet in the shower every other day) i still have a couple weeks left. So I'd say one bottle will last you 3-4 months!",1
Love it. It definitely works for me,1
"The lid is awful on this product its a pain to close, I have dumped 2 bottles of this stuff because I thought it was shut. Other than that its great to put on your ends but do not put too much near your roots or you will look greasy before you have left the house. I have a couple times put too much on a spot and it looks wet all day and dirty. So, just a drop will do but its a nice product with a hot iron especially.",1
"The shade Lychee is truly beautiful---a very ""classy"" color that can be worn for any occasion. The product smells nice (has a vanilla cupcake-like scent) and glides on easily. It dries very quickly, and so you'll want to be precise with your application.

Overall, I would say that the product does live up to its ""long-wear"" claim. It stayed on my lips even after eating and drinking, hours after first application. However, there is *one* caveat: the formula is pretty drying.

Overall, it's a good deal in terms of longevity; however, I would recommend carrying a lip moisturizer around (chapstick, gloss, etc.) since you'll likely need it after a few hours!",1
"I am really enjoying this Juice Beauty Deluxe STEM CELLULAR Moisturizer. I apply before bed and well into the afternoon my skin still feels very smooth & hydrated. I wear minimal makeup during the day, so I can really tell. I've only been using for a short period of time, so I don't see any visible skin changes in regards to fine lines, but as a moisturizer, it definitely does it's job. What I especially like is that a small amount goes a long way. I just squeeze a really small amount of my finger and it spreads well enough to cover the area needed. So just this small sample size tube will last longer than expected. I will surely be purchasing the full size after using this product.",1
Love Jack Black skin products but this one gave me breakout and redness all over my face. I have sensitive/fair skin so caution to others with the same skin.  Thankful this happened while I was on vacation so didn't have to go into work looking like a burn victim. Disappointed as this stuff is not cheap.,0
I like this product because it is sulfate free however it drys my hair out even more than it already is.,1
not really work for me,0
"I do not have sensitive skin by any means. I've done level one and two chemical peels and my skin didn't break out or become tender and red. I used this product for two days. After washing my face, applying at night, letting it sit over night, rinse face in the morning and apply moisturizer. I have little tiny red ITCHY bumps everywhere the pads touched. It's driving me insane. Not acne, so that's cool and all. But an allergic reaction for sure. No amount of Benadryl or cortisone cream is making this any better. Needless to say, this will be making its way to the trash can shortly. Maybe it's just my skin, but I've used other products with similar ingredients, minus the witch hazel, with no issues. My face is not a happy camper.",0
I can finally order this skin ooompher in between appointments.  A few drops goes far when it comes to getting those fine lines to reduce.,1
"I do alot of shopping online and I have never before written a review.  I used this dryer maybe 7 or 8 times.  I keep it in a drawer on top of towels and have handled it like a piece of crystal after reading all reviews.  It just stopped working on my 3rd section of hair today.  The warrenty is not valid if you don't register the product within 21 days of purchase (not even receipt of the dryer), so I am out of luck by 3 days.
This is a testiment to the lack of confidence the company has in it's own product.",0
"DISGUSTING, received this $150 hairbrush with hair still in it. Really a lot of nerve. Negative stars if I could",0
"Was sent wrong product completely...I received the Oribe shampoo for beautiful color, box is damaged and bottle is all scratched. Product does not smell good at all, not sure if its even a real Oribe product.",0
"I use this product all the time. Works great, I put this on and give it an extra five minutes and I am good to go.",1
I love the Bio-Ionic dryers. I just wish they would last longer then they do. I will say that it does help if you have curly or frizzy hair. It works well.,1
I don't believe this is the real deal. It clumps easily and flakes throughout the day. The clumping makes it hard to build your lashes. The tube I got from Sephora definitely didn't do that.,0
Good product,1
This stuff is the best!  Looks very natural.,1
Perfect makeup light and affordable!,1
It was not creamy at all. I expected it to be thicker instead it was watery. The smell isn't like the perfume. It's a little different.,0
"Extremely overpriced for what you get.  Also, the scent is not great.

I'd rather pay this price for local handmade soap that is of much higher quality.",0
"You are absolutely right! It might harm your face!!Please be very careful when you use it! When I went to shopping at Costco, they did a demo on my forearm, but it hurts me and gets irritated. They scratched my arm like cat's scratch. I am afraid they will leave scars on my forearm. Even I put the moisturizer on it like they asked to, I didn't help much! The worst thing is that, the PMD company doesn't even want to take it as their responsibility and simply told me ""that happens all the time""......",0
"I have acne on my forehead for over a year after I stopped breastfeeding.  I had tried multiple products and facials, but to no avail.  I've only used this product for a few days, and already I am noticing a significant improvement.  And what a pleasant surprise when I received the product...it came with very nice free gifts.  These products are doing wonders for my skin.  Thank you!",1
"Great product.  I have been using it for years.  Disappointed in the packaging.  After time, the silver coating flakes off and is a bit messy.  Previous container (white bottle with pink pump) was much better.",1
"Had to through away this product. Was lumpy must of been old, and not worth returning. Very disappointed since I have ordered from this company and have been satisfied in the past.",0
"The incorrect item was sent, initially, but the seller quickly sent out the correct item and was extremely great to work with. Product is as expected as well. Love the item and the seller. Will be back for more.",1
great to have when i have date nite with my hubby glad i bought it.,1

"I have and owned two other Paul Mitchell straighteners and loved them.. (the green ones) This one sucks! It shorts out, but before it turns off it super heats and will burn your hair off. I have thick hair and I have always used my Paul Mitchell flat irons 410 this one does fine at that temperature,but every once in a while it will burn a chunk of hair and the hair falls out because it is burnt so badly. If you must have this one buy it from a Paul Mitchell licensed salon so they will fix it. If not you will be stuck with a 150 $ paper weight.",0
"I bought the Elemis Cellutox bath sachets and the Elemis Musclease Active Body Concentrate while on a cruise. Though it smells great, I have not seen any real benefit after using eight of the ten sachets. The claims of the product are hard to verify. I think if you believe in the benefits, you will reap them. Alternatively and much more economically, I would suggest going to the closest pharmacy and buying a bag of lavender epsom salts and enjoying a soak. The benefits of epsom salts are well documented and the product has been used for years.",0
"This is an excellent pomade for my hair! Most of the hair gels in the store do not give me the right degree of hold that this Baxter Pomade gives me. I have dense and coarse hair and I am happy I purchased this product. Although it is a bit pricey, I will buy it again, in order to have the look that I am always trying to achieve with my hair.",1
"I've been using this perfume for 3 years now, so I really know the smell of it. Its pure alcohol and olily, it doesn't even smell as it should. And the little essence that it has goes away in a few minutos. The only reason I didn't return this product is because I don't live in USA. So it will be so expensive to return. Never again buying a perfume from here! So disappointed.",0
Great!,1
As advertised,1
"Another example of one more cosmetic company that doesn't know the difference between a tint and a stain, and a rather weakly pigmented tint at that. The shade is acceptable I guess, but I ordered a stain! Really pathetic marketing by Jane Iredale. I'm once again, disappointed with a mis-labelled tint when I have been searching for a stain. >:(",0

quit spraying after two uses,0
Keeps hair very moisturized. Love it!,1
It does a good job of curling my eye lashes.  It gets the job done right!  I would recommend it to others.,1
beautiful long lasting polish,1
good product,1
Horrible. Couldn't even swatch these they are so crumbly.,0
"I guess it is hard to show the true color online, but the Water Lily seemed way too ""red"" when I got it.  I was hoping for a more brownish-pink.  Plus it wasn't much of a stain.  At least on my lips, it lasted about an hour.",0
"Great aftershave lotion. Girlfriend loves the scent, and my skin feels amazing afterward. It's expensive, but a little goes a very long way. My only complaint is that the label is falling off and I wish the tube were made of something other than metal. It wrinkles easily. The scent is woodsy and a bit musky, but refined and ever overbearing. You'll catch it throughout the day and anyone particularly close to you will as well, but not in a bad way.",1
Ormedic-I had an allergic reaction to this product line and it was a nightmare. I had a rash on my face and neck-large urticarial. Took about a week to get it under control. Don't buy it.,0
"I LOVE Wen cleansing conditioner and 613. I have the styling cream, straightening serum and the replenishing spray so even though the mousse is expensive I never had a doubt when I ordered it. Not sure if the summer heat got to it or not, but it doesn't foam and it feels slimmy. Would not recommend the mousse.",0
"Love this polish, it stays on a long time. It lasts almost 2wks and my hands are constantly in water and cleaning stuff!",1
Didn't work all that well for me.,0
"4 months ago, I purchased 2 bottles of TOPPIK hair fiber based on all the good reviews that I read from others. After using it for 2 months I noticed my hair loss getting worsen especially on the hairline area. I immediately suspected it had to do with TOPPIK. Then, I went online did an intensive search and found a few blogs that mentioned this produce can actually cause you loss more hair when using it for some people. I immediately stopped using it and my hair loss slowly back to normal pace not as intense as it was when i was using Toppik. Currently, I am on a laser treatment. It seems to maintain my existing hair. BUYER BE AWARE TOPPIK CAN CAUSE MORE HAIR LOSS FOR SOME PEOPLE WHEN USING IT.",0
Very strong scent - could use it to ven once!,0
"It was given as a gift to my granddaughter and she is very happy with it.  She has waist long hair and it works perfectly for her.
Will be buying another one for the other granddaughter as a gift.",1
"I got a sample of this stuff and was really impressed by the smell, the tingles and the volume. I bought a big bottle of this expensive shampoo because I was also excited by all the natural ingredients. However, be warned that a big bottle won't last very long. It kinda takes a lot to lather and you really don't get the effect or experience you want by being stingy with it. I've got to admit that even when using this with the Philip B. weightless leave-in conditioner my hair isn't as soft and shiny as it is when I use my fav stand-by (Organix Coconut Milk) and since I am not rolling in the dough that kinda stinks since I went all out thinking this stuff was AWESOME. Dont get me wrong its still pretty sweet, just probably not a daily use kinda thing.",1
"I don't care where this was made or how ""fancy"" it is, it's the only new product that I've added to my skincare regimen and it made me develop milia under my eyes. I'm really displeased by this formula.",0
"Fleshtone color out of the tube. Goes on really nice- velvety and blurred finish. I am extremely pale and this didn't make me look orange/fake tan like most tinted primers do. However I didn't find this to live up to the hype. I have extremely oily skin, and use oil control products starting with my face wash all the way to my finishing powder and setting spray. This primer definitely helps with the appearance of large pores (while wearing it, doesn't work to improve over time) but the oily control factor isn't fabulous by any means. Make up still disappears off my face throughout the day, doesn't stand up to blotting (foundation comes off with contact), and I find myself blotting in only a couple hours after application.",0
The color is very nice but unfortunately I received this product totally broken.,0
Excellent product and service,1
nice product and affordable price,1

"I love Jane Iredale's skin accumax! I'm 25 years old and get really bad jawline acne. I've been taking this supplement for a couple years now and have seen a dramatic improvement in my acne!

It actually works!,1
The cap is broken. The bottle has dents.,0
buen producto,1
"I hate how most bronzers are shimmery because I have oily skin and it just makes me shinier than I already am. I use this for contouring my face and it's a perfect shade. It's not even the slightest bit orange, which is perfect! I use a bronzer kabuki and am able to build color as I need it and it blends out great. Definitely going to buy again when I run out, but I don't think that'll happen for a while because you get a lot of product!",1
"Did nothing for me, just left me with an ugly rotten smell on my hair for days!!!
I was trying to get rid of a black die but didn't lift a level not even a dark brown like I was expecting! Actually my goal was to get an underlying pigment of red !! But not nothing, just a waist of money! I regret that lost 30$ or so !!!
After that the only way that I'm lifting the black metallic die from my hair is ::::
Highlights! Bleaching my hair is the only way to go !!!",0
Great cleanser!,1
Great moisturizer. I don't break out from it. I used my Amex points and got a great deal. It normally retails for about $65. I highly recommend,1
Brought this for my girlfriend and I use it once in a while.  Its pretty thick and more on the creamy side.  The smell may not suit guys but my girlfriend swears by the effect of it!  Better for those with extra dry skin!,1
"I just started using this product this week so I haven't used it long enough to say if it actually has an effect in reversing sagging underarm skin or crinkly cleavage.  What I can say so far is that the rub is very thick.  A little goes a long way and it needs the appropriate amount of massaging to effectively be absorbed into the skin.  The scent is subtle and not overpowering.  It definitely is a high octane moisturizer and skin feels extremely treated (in a good manner) after applying.

Will try to update more after further use",1
"Poison Plum is a beautiful color - almost black with flecks of purpley-red glitter.  The glitter did create a raised dot on some of my nails, which chipped off and left a hole.  Overall, it was a worthwhile purchase.",1
"Received a different, less expensive product......Prevage Intensive Repair EYE Serum.",0
Delivered on time and as expected.,1
"I really wanted to love this product.  I first tried it as a primer.  The fragrance was overpowering and my hair felt tacky, and I couldn't wait to get home and wash it out.  I tried it a few days later as a conditioner.  It did a nice job as a conditioner, but again, for me the fragrance was just too heavy.",0
Good stuff,1
"It's beyond me why they go out of the way to say this is non-abrasive.  There are huge chunks of almond in this  - if you pressed hard, you would leave literal scratches on your face.  It's benign otherwise - just very poorly made.",0
"Probably one of the most useless things I've ever bought. Only bought it for a small patch of skin and it's done nothing that I can tell and have been using it for about a year. Of course, the instructions tell you to use it past the time you can return it for a refund. I can't imagine people trying to use for large portions of their body like legs or arms. I wonder if the 5 star reviews were bought or planted, because, honestly, this did nothing.",0
"The reviews said this was a spray and it most definitely is NOT!  It's a liquid/cream that you pump.  It smells wonderful initially, but after a while, it's almost overwhelming.  It didn't give my short hair any texture.  It just made it flat!  I was so disappointed and it was very expensive!  Don't buy this if you're hoping for good texture and hold!",0
"DH got his first bottle of Baxter of California Daily Protein Shampoo free and has been buying it ever since. Then he added the conditioner and Super Close Shave Formula to his regime. I expected he'd love the Shave Tonic when I accepted a bottle to review. Indeed, he tried it and was enamored with it, but it isn't a product that he will use and buy regularly. Specifically, he loves the scent and says it feels wonderful, but says it didn't work so great, or feel so different, that he'd stop using the Super Close Shave Formula. So, definitely liked, just not liked as much as his other Baxter grooming products.",1
This is my favorite OPI color ever! I get a lot of compliments on it.  Unfortunately the Polish in this particular bottle chips easier than the last one I had.,1

"I love this!  I don't have a problem with the mint at all.  The lip balm is beautiful!  So creamy and smooth, doesn't make your lips shiny, absorbs quickly, and leaves your lips soft and supple for days!  I've been long searching for a good lip balm, I get terrible dry cracked lips.  I've tried everything, and paid up to $15 for lip balm, even the very pricey&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Hauschka-Skin-Care-Lip-Balm-14-oz-4-2-g/dp/B000Z5Y484/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Hauschka Skin Care Lip Balm .14 oz (4.2 g)</a>&nbsp;repeatedly, honestly I haven't found anything so genuinely moisturizing as Jack Blacks lip balm... I'm surprised to say.

Also, like the other reviewer says, it doesn't make your lip ""addicted"" to the lip balm, where you have to reapply and reapply.  It just moisturizes your lips beautifully, and makes them feel supple and smooth :)

The only problem I have with this is the mint is so strong it actually starts to numb my lips.  I switched to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jack-Black-Lavender-and-Vanilla-Lip-Balm/dp/B003BCG5GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jack Black Lavender and Vanilla Lip Balm</a>&nbsp;and I'm a much happier customer now.

"After years of trying to be ""tan"" my skin will develop a brown spot the minute I go out in the sun. I have been trying to use products to fade the spots on my face. Meanwhile it seems every sunblock I buy makes my eyes water just from being on my face. I tried this one just to see and as long as I steer clear of the eyes it seems to not make them water. I love the way it feels on my skin, it's got a very silky finish to it. I am avoiding the sun like a plague as just driving my hands have developed these brown spots too...all from previous sun exposure. When I leave the house I use this product; hard to avoid the sun while living in Hawaii! I would recommend it.",1
"This curlers are great and work good. I don't use them near as much as I thought I would, requires more time than I wish to donate.",1

"This iron is a bit on the heavy side and snagged and pulled my hair and left it dry dull and lifeless, i actually had parts that looked burnt and crumbled to the touch and i was not even to the extremely hot setting  , this is just a metal barrel the gold blah blah is non sense,  i have a paul mitchell straightner which is soo smooth and adds shine to my hair probably i ll try the curling iron from same brand.",0
Receive well. Just like water in a spray bottle but I feel fresh when I use it.,1
Great Product,1
This cream works fantastically on me skin. I keep buying it since a while and I will continue to do that!,1
"Great product. My skin could use a bit more moisture during winter months, I use a Vit C and Hyaluronic Acid serum under it.",1
"Didnt work at all. Very difficult to push, would not recommend.",0
Was a gift for granddaughter,1
"This product works great! I had missed covering a couple of small areas on the front of my shoulders and after an afternoon in full sun, the only area badly burned was where I had missed applying this sunscreen!  My one complaint and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the container started leaking out of a small hole in the bottom!  Luckily, I had put the container in a plastic zip bag and the sunscreen did not get all over the clothes in my suitcase. Fix the container and I will be a life long customer.",1
"After using this daily for a couple of weeks I began noticing pimples, especially on and around my nose and eyes. I stopped using it for a while to see if perhaps it was something other than the product. My skin cleared up within a day or two and I had no further breakouts. However now after using it in the morning for a single day I'll have breakouts beginning by the afternoon. This is unfortunate because initially I really liked the product!",0
Great stuff love it,1
"I first tried this product at the Canyon Ridge Spa in Las Vegas during a facial.  As someone who battles chapped lips almost year round (but especially in winter), I am always trying new lip products.  I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  This kit contains a lip scrub, lip mask and a lip gloss as the third step.  I really like the lip scrub which contains sugar (I think) and the lip mask.  After applying either the scrub or the mask, even my severely chapped lips took on a smooth and healthy appearance.  I am less impressed with the lip gloss but it does have a pleasant texture and appearance although I don't know if it actually helps the lips heal in any way (which would be nice).  All in all, I think that this is a good product.  My only complaint is that I would prefer it if the products were sold separately because I would like to be able to buy the scrub and mask by themselves without the need to purchase the whole kit.",1
This is not the same product. It has been tampered with and filled with something else. Do not buy.,0
"Locks in the nail polish well! Unfortunately I just found out that Zoya is just as toxic as any other nail polish brand, according to the Think Dirty App that rates these things :(",1
"I currently use Panasonic electric nose hair trimmers. Unfortunately, Panasonic changed its blade design and newer models do not cut as close. I bought this trimmer in the hope it would, but it does not seem to have any effect at all. I can only assume that it onlu cuts very long nose hairs, but can't deal with shortly cropped ones.",0
Still love L'ANZA but the price has more than doubled on most of their products! Not sure that I will be able to continue purchasing this product which is disappointing since I have been an avid user and promoter of their products for several years now.,0
"This is a good product for what it is. I don't normally use a setting spray for street (everyday) makeup but it does hold your look very well. The spray isn't sticky, dries quickly, and isn't irritating to the skin. It held my eye makeup even better than I expected. I didn't have eyeshadow in the creases like I normally do after 8 hours of wear. And the scent was pleasant and faded quickly.

I think the bottle itself could use a little redesign though. I think it sprays too wide. It got into my hair and on my shirt just from a quick spray directed at the middle of my face. I think it would benefit from a slightly smaller spread.

Other than that, it works very well. I will keep it to use for special occasion makeup and when I do stage makeup.",1
"This is a pleasantly-scented eye cream that does provide some temporary lift. There is no allergic reaction, no itching or burning, either.  The cream absorbs quickly. The tube has a very small opening, so only a little can come out at a time.  Not much is needed to lift the sagging skin around the eyes.  For me the price is cost-prohibitive, though.",1
Has a weird aftersmell.. unfortunate because i LOVE tonymoly.,0
Works fairly well but not all day long.,1
"Because if I'd have paid full price elsewhere I'd be even more disappointed.  Curls don't hold, had the rollers in until cooled sprayed the curls they still fell flat.  Also for hair as long as mine, I probably need twice as many rollers, but even setting only half my hair at a time AND using a heat setting spray...flat in 10 min.",0
Have not used this long enough to know if it will work.  It feels good going on.,1
"Smell is awesome, but it's pricey",1
"I have to say when reading reviews i am always skeptical, but am glad that this is one of the few products that i tried based off of reviews.  It works really well on clearing up small clusters of pimples and has done wonders for me.  I honestly wish i had found out about this product sooner, and will definitely be ordering it again.",1
Ok . I like it. I will buy it again,1
"This stuff is great for softening rough, cracked heels. Apply for a couple of days then soak your feet, and you can slough off a ton of dead skin.  Repeat as needed until heels soft.  I've had the pedicurist tell me what nice, callous free feet I have. I have not used on elbows, and my husband ignored the label and slapped some on his face, and then commented that it burned, so i wouldn't recommend using as facial moisturizer (the high acid percentage should clue you in there.)",1
Didnt do much.,0
"""Six heat and speed settings"".  To me that would mean 3 heat settings (low, medium and high heat) and 3 speed settings (low, medium and high fan settings). Not what you get unfortunately. The nozzle is also smaller than most. Ok for shorter hair I would assume. But for thicker, long hair where you're using a large round brush, it takes much longer to dry.",0
"I like the idea of using the eraser instead of a traditional washcloth. However, I was surprised how easily the cloth stained. I do not recommend the cloth for removing eye makeup unless you plan on using a new cloth daily.",0
"Is a product that did not do well to my hair and also if it has a very strong and horrible smell.
Do not use it anymore.",0
My daughter got me hooked on hers... So I ordered one! I love it... It makes your skin sooo smooth...get it now!,1
I'm 28 and have occasional seasonal or hormonal acne.  This overnight treatment works great!,1
This made my hair feel very heavy and greasy. I did rinse and rinse and rinse but it is just not for me. It also took forever to dry my hair afterwards and I needed to wash it again sooner than usual. Maybe if you have very fine hair? Sure worth the $2 sample to find out. This product is also very expensive. Can't see me using the $2 credit on a different $50 or $60 product by Phyto.,0
Great .. Thanks,1
Terrible I have oily hair and it made my hair feel weighted down.,0
I love this body mist. It is such a pleasant soft fragrance. It reminds me of being at the beach.,1
"Not sure how to describe this aftershave other that...WOW! Love the smell.

A couple of drops go a long ways though so don't get carried away or you will stink to high heaven. Remember, things with alcohol should never go on your face. Rub this in your hair or back of the neck to prevent dry skin and later, wrinkles. Unless you like that sort of thing then go for it.",1
"Bought this in conjunction with the rest of the required items to do an at home shellac manicure. This is a great value, you will def save money doing these at home yourself. I did my first one tonight & it turned out awesome. So easy to use. I def recommend. :)",1
leaves my hair too limp,0
"I expected more from this product, but, unfortunately, it did not work well for my hair. I have full, but fine, frizzy curly hair and this leave-in does not do anything for it. It was an expensive and disappointing purchase. I do not recommend it.",0
"Zoya is a great brand of nail polish, it lasts on my nails longer than any other brand (even high-end ones) that I've ever tried. In addition, Faye is my favorite nail polish color ever.  It looks gold/bronze in some light, copper in other light, and purple/lavender at times as well. It's a very shiny/metallic an festive color perfect for any season or occasion!",1
LOVE this facial spray. It helps refresh my face throughout the day when it feels dry. I haven't tried it yet when I have a full face of makeup but I am sure it will be awesome then as well. I love the smell and the way it settles into my skin. Not bad for the price either.,1
"I don't know how this is getting so many good reviews but these disc are VERY VERY weak in my opinion. I got my replacement for 10 dollars im not sure why its so overpriced here. I don't like these disc at ALL, the grit is very weak and its made from cheap aluminum. These disc are very LOW quality, and I don't recommend them for someone who wants to get rid of acne scars or minimize pores.

These disc aren't effective, I saw good reviews on the PMD which is why I even tried it but I need something of better quality and stronger for my skin. Very disappointed in these disc especially since I have sensitive skin, and these red coarse disc didn't do ANYTHING for my skin problems.

These disc and the PMD device was a WASTE of money! Im not going to buy these anymore, Im looking for something better and effective.",0
I usually buy my products from my plastic surgeons office. I have used  this product for over 10 years. This does not work. One tube gives no reaction at all the other tube is broken and squirts out all over everywhere. I am not happy with this product.,0
The spray bottle did not work I was very upset and I order joy all the time  not from amazon,0

Love the product a lot but pump on top was broken,0
"I absolutely love this curler. My friend let me use hers and I immediately bought one for myself. It's a miracle tool! My only wish is that there could be a looser curl option. My hair is naturally curly and even the loose curl options (according to the instruction manual) actually makes my curls tighter than my natural curl. However, if I straighten my hair and then wait a day to use this tool, the curls relax a bit. Not as much as I'd normally want, but I'm still happy to have a curling tool that doesn't burn my fingers/hair and only takes 15 minutes to style my entire mane!",1
Perfect.  No complaints!,1
"This is my updated review of the lavender soap bar! At first I didn't like it very much and had not bought bar soap for many years using only liquid soap for face, hands and body. I have tried this and a few others that are similar in price (or even more expensive) and it's growing on me now. The reviews of this soap are basically good and I can see now why they are. My skin has not been dry after using this and I did test it by not using any lotion on my body which I normally do every night after a shower. I also used it to hand wash some underwear and it was quite good. The lavender fragrance is not too strong for those who want to have the smell linger afterwards. As I said in my first review this bar is rather large and a bit awkward at first. I found it slipping out of my hands but am using a washcloth now to prevent this from happening. I did want to revise my first negative review for people like myself who do read them before buying something they're not familiar with online! The original version was: This is the first soap bar that I have purchased in many years - I use bath and shower gel and liquid face soap. I thought I would try something different and since this had many good reviews and I like the smell of lavender I bought it. I recently noticed that my skin was looking 'thin' and I attributed this to the many showers using a washcloth on my skin with the liquid soap. My skin is normally dry (bar soap has always been drying to me and I do apply moisturizer after every shower) and this one didn't feel dry right after using it which I did like. The bar is large and should last a long time but it does get slippery when it gets wet and slides off the built in soap bar in the shower and it's somewhat awkward to hold on to. The lavender smell is not so strong and it really doesn't have any scent unless you put your nose on top of the bar before it gets wet. As for the price of this soap I think it's a little too high and possibly because of the name L'Occitane and the fact that it's made in France the way it is described.  I'm not sorry I bought this and will use it eventually, perhaps for some hand washing of delicates. I will say this soap lathers very well!",1
"I did not like this product. It made my hair oily and weighed it down. It did nothing to help control frizz. It may have helped protect it from the heat, but the other issues made this product a no no for my mixed (Black, Native Am, Puerto Rican) 3C hair. I will keep looking for the keeper.",0
Works great with the Bosley Shampoo.,1
I have short naturally curly hair. I have been using this product for 10 years. It's the only thing that doesn't weigh my curls down & adds shine! Wish it were sold at more places!,1
I typically mix this with a bit of eucerin sensitive skin SPF 30 face cream (which is a bit white going on as it contains a physical sunscreen) as its a bit too dark on my skin by itself. The feel is very silky and the smell doesn't offend. A great product overall!,1
Good. Shampoo,1
"Shipping was the only issue I had.  The lid wasn't tight and some leaked out.  It was in a plastic bag so it didn't make a mess in the box.  I would suggest you secure the flip top lid for future packaging.  Like tape it down.  That is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.

Other that that great product at a great price.  And shipping was fast.",1
This product made my scalp break out in painful white bumps. Definitely allergic to something in this product and I've never been allergic to anything before.,0
Does not get hit enough. Bought this for my wife and she didn't like it. Had to return it but great return policy.,0
"Great conditioner, it makes my hair soft! Arrived quickly.",1
"It works the way it claims, making makeup last longer and helping it look nice. The downside is that it seems like a tube won't last long, so it could get expensive (but maybe this would be nice to use for occasions when you really need to look particularly good). I get a bit of irritation from it as well, so I don't think I'd want it on my skin every day, and it doesn't have SPF so you're giving up sun protection (or having to use something separately, perhaps invest in a sun hat so you're not stacking a bunch of different chemicals on your face?).

On the whole it does its job, but I think for most people it'd end up being impractical as a daily use item.",1
This is fake.  The color isn't close to the actual OPI color. Compared to other authentic opi nail polish bottles the packaging is off also,0
I do not recommend,0
The rollers do not stay in place with the pins supplied... they keep falling out. The clips leave ridges in the hair. Too much money for a poorly designed hot roller.,0
"I have only been using this moisturizer for a couple months but I very much like it.

PROS: My skin is CLEAR (underline underline underline). I have combination skin that is prone to breaking out or having dry patches or oily patches depending on it's mood. This stuff has been lovely. I now maybe get a a pimple or two right before my period (amirightladies?) but they are small and go away within a couple days. This goes on very light, a little goes a long way, it does not feel greasy or too creamy, and it dries very quickly.

CONS: Expensive for how small the container is. I used to use Effaclar Moisturizer and switched to this just those few months ago and am debating whether I should use both to stretch out the shelf-life of this product. I feel like it is already dwindling down to a point where I should order more and it has only been a couple months. The Effaclar would last me 5-6 months at least (I use a very small dollop twice a day). The smell is weird. It has this kind of sickly sweet chemical smell to it. It's not awful but it's not the best either. It hasn't deterred me from using it, nor will it, just thought it was something to point out.",1
"Don't buy this if you have thicker hair.  My hair is thick and straight.  The clip is to small to hold it, and it takes forever to curl it with this iron because you have to use such small sections.  Otherwise it seems to work - but I'd guess only for certain hair types.",0
Great product,1
I've been using this product for a few months and can already notice a difference in my hair. My other straighteners use to damage my hair and I am starting to realize my hair becoming healthier. Great product.,1
The brushes are too soft and do not appear to add radiance to my face.,0
"It's  a wo derful product,  not greasy, nice aroma and it works very well.  Skin is nice a soft.",1
Love the smell and love the way makes my hair feel.,1
La Roche-Posay Redermic C UV Moisturizer goes on every smoothly. It feels like despite it having SPF 25 coverage in it. I have sensitive skin with some rosacea. This moisturizer does not irritate my skin. Having rosacea using sunscreen is really important. This moisturizer doesn't feel like I'm using sunscreen. It is moisturizing. Now I haven't used it during the winter time yet when my skin is its driest. But for now I feel confident that it will still provide the necessary coverage. Most of my fine lines are on my forehead and around my eyes. They are not that deep yet. My skin is feeling firmer. Making the wrinkles appear less obvious. This is not a large tube of moisturizer. But it is a moisturizer that works.,1
The handle kept coming unlocked. It was very annoying being burnt that much. I gave it my best shot,0
I love the smell of anything vanilla and have been trying to find a perfume that smells like the Ecco Bella Vanilla cream. I have tried so many but none really capture the sweet Vanilla I am looking for (closest so far has been Bath and Body's Vanilla Bean Noel that is seasonal). My husband took one whiff and said it smelled like Play-Doh to him and after he said it I had to agree. It smells like a vanilla scented Play-Doh.,0
i was over charged for item..Did not realize it was a smaller bottle until it arrive....this  a bad for me...i was able for find same product on overstock for half this price.,0
It's verry bad!!!!!! I take two diferent order. Inside were pieces!!!! Don't buy!!!,0
"My 3 year old son has eczema especially during winter time. I've tried ALL and I mean all kinds of products for eczema...from drugstore brands to high end department store brands...wasn't helping at all. My son's Pediatrician suggested that I use hydrocortizone, it does help a little bit but I wanted a safer alternative. Thank goodness I found Stelatopia. It is a little pricey but definitely worth it. I've only used it for a week and I am amazed at the results! It's definitely getting better. You only have to use a little bit so it should last for a long time. I suggest to use the Stelatopia Cream Cleanser in combination with the Stelatopia Moisturizing Cream for best results.",1
Waist of your money,0
"While it did reduce the redness without causing any breakouts, the smell was so rancid I couldn't stand it.  I threw it out after a week, even though it was not expired.  I thought the smell would go away, but no luck.  I will try to order it directly from Avene's website, since it is one of the few products that really worked on my rosacea.  I have used prescription (metro gel, finacea, oracea, sulfacetamide) and OTC rosacea moisturizers (Clinique, Dermadoctor, Philosophy, La Roche-Posay, Replenix, SkinMedica, MyChelle, Eucerin, Triderma, Aveeno, CeraVe, etc.).  I wish I could go back to Paris to buy it from an authorized retailer.",0
"I had the same problem with others with this product.  It was clearly past its shelf life and I cannot use it as it smells like expired cream.  I wrote to the vendor asking for a refund but they never responded.  Nice.  Actually, not nice.",0
"The rollers get too hot and do not stay in very well. I stick kleenex under the roller to keep from burning my scaple.  I hope to find a way to use them.  Electric curlers need a heat setting like curling irons. I probaly should return it, and just have not got around to it yet.  I had one before and it was the opposite, it did not get very hot, and I still have it.  Too expensive when it does not work well, but I like the size of curlers.",0
My first one that came with the flash in go lasted three times longer than these. Huge disappointment. I will have to buy from someone else next time.,0
Love the spray but the sprayer doesn't work successfully. Needs to be primed and rinsed with water often. Very annoying!,1
This dried out my skin so bad that it felt tight and uncomfortable. Would not recommend this unless you have very oily skin.,0
I still have deep lines!!,0
"This is a great product, however the packaging wasn't so great. It leaked some in the box and just had tap over the nozzle.",0
"Applies awful, not worth the buy",0
"As a product tester, I am required to post a review within 30 days of testing a product.  I do believe this product will take longer than 30 days to show its desired results, so I hope to post an update to this review within the next few months.

I believe the NuFACE Trinity is a revolutionary product.  It was important to me that the product had received clearance from the FDA, which it has.  The device is designed to provide a solution for multiple skin care concerns.  It is designed to work with multiple treatment attachments, but it is important to note that the Microcurrent attachment is the only one included with the trainer kit.  The Microcurrent attachment is meant to gently and effectively stimulates the surface of your face to help improve your skin's appearance.  The other attachments are sold separately, and require somewhat of an investment.

In just a few days, I can honestly say that I have noticed some difference in my facial contour and skin tone.  I am banking on the accuracy of the clinical studies which state that after 60 days of use, 85% of users experienced improvements in facial contour, and 73% of users experienced improvements in skin tone.  I am personally looking for improved facial contour and skin tone around the forehead, eyebrows, jawline, and jowls.  If I continue to notice improvement, I will seriously consider purchasing the ELE (Effective Lip and Eye) and Wrinkle Reducer attachments.  But, since each attachment is $150, I would like to see significant results from the Microcurrent attachment first.

To use the trainer, I cleanse my face thoroughly and apply the NuFACE Gel Primer.  Then, I simply glide the Trinity Facial Trainer over the natural contours of my face for roughly five minutes each day.  When finished, I remove the NuFACE Gel Primer and apply my favorite skin care (Vitamin E Moisture Cream).  The instructions indicate that when I begin to achieve desired results, I can reduce the frequency to two to three days a week.

NuFace Trinity is an ergonomic handheld design making the process very effortless.  So far, I am very pleased with the product and its early results.",1
Wife loves this product,1
The bottle was chipped from the sides,0
greatttt product...honestly i bought this because of reviews i have seen on youtube. I had highhhh expectations because of the high price.... For reference i have A LOT of thick hair but its sleek... SOOO it tends to get a bitttt flat on the crown... my curls also tend to fade away because of the fact that they are so soft...I spray this in my roots and the ends of my hair and then i flip my hair down and fluff up the root and BOOM volume. Its amazing.. Not only is it amazing at that moment but it looks great throughout the day..if it flattens out throughout the day i flip my hair over and fluff and BOOM volume again. LOVE THIS PRODUCT..,1
"Really pleased with this product, it's just as good as the previous colour I used for years. I'd reccomend this product to anyone.",1
"It is great, I haven't had many other shaving creams with my badger brush and will try a few others before I claim perfect.",1
"I usually love Zoya, but the black is the worst black I have ever bought in my entire life, and I wear a LOT of black nail polish. It's opaque, which makes it look really gross without multiple coats, but it's also drippy and tacky for a REALLY long time if you do thick enough coats for it to actually be black instead of a nasty watery grey. Just terrible. Would return it if it were worth the trouble. I did my nails this MORNING and it's already chipping.",0
"Believed all the posters that it would clear but my babies acne. Made it far worse now it covers her cheeks, forehead completely and going to her upper trunk.... this stuff is not pure please be careful with that delicate newborn skin.",0
"I love how this makes my skin feel! I would love to try all the brush heads and do a review on them. I had the sensitive brush head before and have enjoyed it. Both brush heads work well on my combo skin. I definitely like the radiance brush head more than the sensitive one just because it feels so soft but at the same time, my face still feels clean. One point off for how expensive these gadgets cost.",1
I have very fine and thin hair.  This product doesn't work well on my hair.,0
"i have been using this product for over 25 years and find it to be one of the best values on the market
i have large pores and this is the only product that really makes a physical difference in their appearance  and also feels great when the process is finished!!
thank you",1
My favorite for years.,1
This came highly recommended by a couple of friends. I like the fact that it gets absorbed by the skin quickly and it's not oily. Be careful not to get it near or in your eyes.,1
Deoderant stick fell out first tim it was inverted,0
It does not work  it  does not curl hair,0
Doesn't cover well enough for me. But I use cover cream and the loose powder and  also leg and body makeup and they cover great.,0
This hairdryer is wonderful! It definitely dries my hair faster than regular conair models.,1
Too Greasy,0
Disappointing - but dry shampoos are...,0
"I realize that fragrance and scent are subjective things/experiences, but this L'Occitane Lavender is NOT anything like any lavender I've ever smelled.  I was looking for a true lavender scent, with some woodsy/citrusy hints, as this has been described by others.

But this product has a chemical-type odor (the 2nd or third ingredient, right before lavender oil, is ""fragrance""--this is a chemical mix, and not an essential oil.)  I found this to be a very acrid scent, and, it doesn't last--which begs the question, why would I want to wear something that smells this bad?  Sorta like, ""the food is terrible, and such small portions.""

I thought I could use it as an air freshener, but the odor was so bad, even my husband complained about it ""what IS that?  It smells like new car odor mixed with Pledge furniture spray!""  He was right.",0
"Beware I could only use this spray twice , delivered almost empty",0
"This foundation stick is SO BAD! Not only do you get the most ridiculous amount of product (0.16 oz compared to the standard 1 oz), but the product itself is not good. I can not believe the price of this foundation for the amount of product you get. Absolutely do not spend your money on this. It is not high coverage like it says it is. I think it is about medium, and it is not buildable to full coverage. If you have acne or scarring to cover, this will not cover it. It kind of just sits on top of the skin and looks very unnatural and cakey. It somehow looks way better once my skin became extremely oily, but it also looked really cakey. I do not recommend this product to any skin type. I made a video applying this, so once I get that edited and uploaded I will update this review with the link so you guys can check it out if you're interested to see how it applies and looks on the skin.",0
Had to return. Wasn't the product I was looking for. Also didn't work on neither mine or my friends skin tone,0
"With no heat control settings, it is very damaging to the hair",0
No directions Really nothing,0
These are the best candles- worth the price- they last forever!!,1
Unfortunately it did not work at all with my hair. I have medium length fine hair. It generally does okay with updos though.,0
good product,1
It seems to be more coconut oil than anything else.,0
I like it but I don't love it. Its much darker than I expected so its easy to over-do it.,1
Love! Best Bronzer especially if you HAC,1
Goog,1
Product arrived open and refilled. You could see where they glued the sticker back on the lid. So who knows what they put in it. It smells like dish detergent.,0
Love it!  Easy!  Just wish somehow it could magically do my hair a bit quicker.... but it's super easy.,1
Tried on three different dryers. Slipped off while using on all three.,0
Great smell,1
"I've used the Proraso shave soaps in the tub a couple times, as well as other shaving soaps, and this has become my new favorite. I find it easier to achieve a nice lather with this than with traditional soaps, and it gives a good shave. It's not a super thick lather, so if that's a priority for you, then maybe pass on this, but if you don't mind a little thinner lather, you'll like it. My favorite part, though, is that the menthol in it gives you a cool, tingly feeling on your skin, and when you do a cold-water rinse after shaving, it's like plowing your face into a snowbank. Refreshing and wakes you up! If you've tried Proraso in the tub and liked it, give this a go.",1
the brush is not great.. crazy in love with this color..,0
"Great product, really helps to keep you looking younger.",1
Seems to do the trick. It removes a lair of skin and seems to reduce the visibility of freckles and other facial marks with use. A little pricey though.,1
I like this brush better than the other ones available. Works best for my combination skin with some hormonal acne.,1
Pretty color,1
bottle was not full - won't order from this vendor again.,0
"I have been struggling with adult acne for years. I'm in my thirties, but my skin was worse than some teens, until I used this kit. It took awhile, about a month, but it really works. I found the lotion too sticky so I am not using that and I actually bought the full strength apple peel and like it better than the sample in this kit, but it is worth trying! I now use the wash, blemish serum, and apple peel and my skin looks and feels better than it has in years. It also makes me feel good to not be adding a ton of drying, irritating chemicals to my skin.",1
Is helping me through a bout with hyperpigmentation.. But isn't as effective as I was hoping.  It's very much like concealer I think.  At least it's something tho.  Smaller thank youd think from the pic,1
"First in 2010, we didn't like the way our 65 year old, short hair, felt after using, enough so that we didn't finish the bottle. Then in 2012, but didn't like that it seemed to leave our 67 year old hair dull and brittle, enough so that we didn't finish the bottle. 3rd time was a winner, love the scent and the way it leaves the 69 year old hair. Not sure about the thickening claim after one month.",1
I had this product for a little over a month and have only used it a few times cause I went on vacation for a month and forgot to take it with me and it not heating up and my curls are not nice I'm really disappointed and do not have the box to return it,0
I used this patches 4 more than a year. I think it's the best therapy patches I ever use. It's realy does it job. You see the result right away.,1
"Not sure if it's legit; didn't help me in either case. Used for body acne and seemed to make no difference, though it didn't seem to break me out further?",0
"I used this the first time I staightened my hair. It lasted about 3 days, not sure if it was the weather or my resitant hair. At this time I cannot make an astute judgement as to whether or not the product really works. Most of hair remained straight (middle & ends) but my edges kept reverting-eventhough I took pain staking steps to keep dry during showers & face washes.

Will try again next month.",1
"I purchased the original Blinc mascara and absolutely LOVED it so I wanted to try this Amplified version so that I could easily apply another later. I purchased it back in July and just opened it to use it and it's awful! Not because of the formula, but the brush! It's almost 2x's the size of the original brush and is so hard to apply.  I tried using the brush from my old one and sadly it does not fit in this tube.  Love the formula but the brush is horrible!",0
"This is a knock-off. I bought this as backup for the exact same one I ordered from the Lord & Berry website. This one is fake. It doesn't even look like the same product. Additionally, the real lip crayon that I got directly from the company feels lovely and stays put forever, with no help needed from sealant or powder. The fake product I bought here was oily, felt gross, and instantly wiped off. I reapplied it and tried not touching it for an hour, and it wiped off just as quickly. The color didn't even match the real deal. For the price I paid, this is utterly ridiculous. It ought to be a crime. I'm extremely displeased and upset.",0
i like it it makes my skin feels smooth but i don't get much from rubbing,1
This oil did a so so job on helping my course hair be more soft...this oil did NOT have a great smell that really stays with your hair...I will not buy this again. I could buy coconut oil for 1/5th the cost and get the same effect.,0
The product was expired. Dated from 2004. Unacceptable!,0
"Does not fit Art of Shaving Brush. Opening is too narrow to fit any part of handle.
Flimsy does not have enough weight to hold brush even if you had one that fit.
Appears to be designed to stick on mirror or something opposite of how it is displayed in picture. There is adhesive tab on back",0
I received the wrong item TWICE  in the right box don't know what's going on there very dissatisfied!!,0
"First time I bought it was just like the one I got in the salon. The second one I bought 2 months later was not at all the same - when I sprayed it on my finger tips it had a totally different look and feel- it would be bubbly, thin, more liquidy and seemed more like hairspray than the waxiness that the one from the salon had. I still give 2 stars because the first one was good. But the second one just wasn't the same",0
"What a surprise this Dermablend Smooth Liquid Camo  was for me.  I thought maybe I had become immune to creams and makeup  after so many have claims that you can change from looking like an 80 year old to Taylor Swift after 1 week and you can do this for $4.95 trial and $97. automatically added to your charge each month thereafter.

 I should add here that I was at one-time on a first-name basis with the manager of cosmetics at Neiman Marcus.  I've tried so many and few have impressed me.  THIS ONE DOES.  This is so blendable and covers so well.  It doesn't cake on my face.  I have tried it with a sponge,  with a professional makeup brush. and with my fingers - all worked easily.

As I was not familiar with this company, I had not looked up their history.  I have no idea how long they have been around nor anything else about them (which I have done with many companies and products) but it's the ease and look of the coverage you get with this product that makes you fall in love.  I now have six of  the products made by Dermablend and I'm next going to see if they have branched out into llipsticvk or mascara.  But even if this is all they make, I'm sticking with  them until some one comes up with the product that will make me the new 40.",1
Best dry shampoo out there.,1
"I've finally found a wonderful spray that isn't sticky or leaves the hair too hard! This CHI product is awesome, I can control the hold and not worry about the hair losing it's life and bounce.",1
"Beware!!! The real product that you buy from the salon is wonderful, but this must be some kind of knock-off. I thought my husband was joking when he said it smelled horrible and didn't smell like the same shampoo we had previously bought from the salon. He was right. It literally has the after-smell of cat urine. Expensive lesson learned...don't order online. I'll be sticking to the salon from here on out.",0
This helps my thinning hair keep a style.,1
Delicate Jasmine scent is wonderful!,1
"Great product, it was delivered in a few days, nice purchase, Thanks, Jim.",1
Stop warming up after couple months. Can't use on short hair like advertised.,0
"I have had this hair dryer for 2 years now. It was great when I first started using it.  I need the concentrator to style my hair and the concentrator just slides onto the end of the nozzle. Over time, it would would start flying off when I used the high speed on the dryer.  When I would pick it up off the floor, it was burning hot so I had to use a towel to put it back on the hair dryer.  After numerous times of flying off the hair dryer, the concentrator cracked.  This made it worse as it would not stay on at all anymore.  I've been looking at newer models of the same hair dryer and it seems that they have not had any complaints about the concentrator because they are still made the same way so I a staying away from BaByliss, which is disappointing since I really like the hair dryer. My other complaint was that it was just too heavy. I'm trying so hard to find a hair dryer that will give me the results that BaByliss could.....just wish they didn't have the flaws that really bother me.",0
"Discovered this a few years ago at my hair cuttin place in Southlake, TX and have used it ever since. Not only the best paste on the market, but their cologne and other hair products are top notch as well. The scent is hard to describe, but impossible to forget. My wife and numerous others have described it as sexy, manly, brings out their primal desires. What Im trying to say is that this product is a straight up panty-dropper! My testosterone levels have tripled since I started using this product, and Ive accidentally fathered 8 kids as a result of merely passing their respective mothers on the sidewalk. I can now grow a full beard in a single day and I changed my last flat tire with my left hand while holding up my truck with my right. Perfect for natural all-day hold and styling, buy with confidence!",1
Leaves a residue on skin I feel but I still like them. Leaves skin with a slight sticky feeling.,1
"I purchased this product a couple of weeks ago, and it came with a return package and label to send it back if I wasn't satisfied. I thought I would use it a few times and return the unused portion for a full refund. Guess what? I wouldn't give it back for the world. It 100% does NOT smell and I have used several self tanners, from the super store or pharmacy and high end self tanners. This one is by the far the best! The color comes up in about an hour and it lasts for about a week. It's very natural looking. If you are completely white you may have to use it once and once more a few days later for your first time, only because you may miss a spot or two, so if you have an event coming up plans ahead so your tan will be nice and even. I use it on my face and body. I didn't purchase a different one for my face and I am very pale and got the medium color one. This product is MUCH better than Sophora and the likes of them!!! I rarely fall so in love with a product like this one...",1
Left my skin smooth but did little for my mild/moderate body acne,0
"This is a very nice product for long or mid length curly hair that wants to be straight. It makes the hair shiny and it has a very safe teflon coat everywhere which makes for easy use. However, I have short hair that is long on top that needs volume. This product is not for volume. Hence 4 stars.",1
The very best foot creame,1
"This is just what I was looking for. I love the smell. The product makes my hair feel much softer & smoother. I use this right out of the shower, before I blow dry. Use sparingly, will leave your hair looking greasy if you overuse.",1
"I'm perplexed by the gushing reviews here.  Although the packaging is very cool and exotic (and it being Italian is a plus to me), it provides virtually no more lubrication than water alone.  I've tried both small and large quantities of it on my face.  Compared with less expensive shaving cream (both tubes bought on Amazon and commodity cans), I find this one the worst.  Am I missing something?",0
"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1
I can feel the difference of before and after use it. Nice product.,1
I am almost at the end of the jar and haven't noticed any changes in my skin.  My skin absorbed it quickly but it still felt like my face was dry so I followed up with another moisturizer.  A little too pricey for not getting anything in return.,0
"I've been using the RS2 line for 10 years because I have dermatitis with red blotches, not rosacea but this works great! I had occasionally tried a new to market less expensive product. I always went back to Pevonia and will never leave again!  I am 55 yrs old and this product is so gentle, light, and nourishing that I get many compliments on my skin. Well worth the money as it lasts quite a long time.",1
"It definitely dry your hair faster, but the cons are; 1) broke after three months. 2) It really DRYS your hair, increase split ends...  will rather go with Panasonic.",0
"This is a useless product.  It's an attachment to an even more worthless product.  I have deep sagging wrinkles.  Nothing other than a facelift can solve my problems.  The lights flash, and it causes blurred vision and headaches.",0
The shipper send out in OG packaging and it is a better quality curler.  The only thing why I didn't rate it a 5 is it can create a hard crease if not done properly making lashes look like-->  L,1
The quality of product that I got was so bad. The liquid was came out when I got it and it has only 3/4.,0
"I did not love this make-up brush cleaner. First, the process of using this stuff to clean your brushes is a long one. I just don't have the time for that. Second, the smell wasn't pleasant. Third, the spray nozzle isn't great. I now buy a brand from CVS and LOVE it. I wouldnt purchase this one again.",0
It did not help at all waste of money,0
"It works! This week has been great, my hair looks normal, and little to no flakes.

I have had dry scalp issues for years. They only got worse since moving to Colorado ten years ago.
At first I thought I had dandruff, but no dandruff shampoo solved the issue. I tried switching to baby shampoo, i tried putting baby oil in my hair when it was still wet. This just made my hair look greasy.

The last few weeks my hair has been looking like it was on a corpse, dry, dull. I was embarrassed to wear dark shirts and sweaters because flakes of scalp where obvious all over my shoulders and back. I was wearing an outdoor skull cap at work sometimes.

I got my hair cut on Monday and the woman who was doing it of course noticed the problem and asked what conditioner I use. I said none and she recommended this moisturizer. I usually think they are just trying to sell more crap but I did end buying this product and am glad I did",1
People say this could last a year I blew through it in 90 days,0
"I'm glad I purchased the small trial size first. I ended up being allergic to the product. I rarely, if ever experience product allergies, but this product made my eyes swell shut.",0
"It works somewhat, just don't sign up for the autoship, because even if you call to cancel, they will keep billing you and you will have to go through your credit card company to get it reversed.  Which I did, and I was happy, until another email showed up today that says I am two months behind.  If you can get one product and try it, you might like it.  I just wasn't going to use it fast enough to want it every month.",0
"When I went to my salon the last time, I picked up a travel size and LOVED IT! I picked up this one on Amazon out of convenience and it has a totally different scent, color, and feel. Im so disappointed and wish I had looked at the low reviews.",0
It does not work.,0
This really does work!  Even on eye make-up.  Worth it but be sure and wash it first (directions says this).,1
again 1/4 of one can & 1/2 of other has stopped spraying,0
Super convenient,1
"The color is true to the pic ,,, I love OPI Polish , the names of the colors are enough to make me want to collect as many as I can ! The color and quality of these polishes never disappoint !
I will take this newbie along for my pedi tomorrow :)",1
It's tiny!!  Bought for international travel because it's dual voltage.  Will see how it works and report back....,1
"Bought one in March of this year now one of the plates doesnt get hot at all... hoping theres a return policy since its been less than a year and I paid close to 150 for it, the only reason Im giving it two stars is because it works so well on my hair but quality wise and how long it lasts is very disappointing!!",0
"I was very disappointed, bag was damaged and soap leaked all over box. Do not plan to order this item again.",0
"Fantastic for my sensitive skin, so glad I found this product! Squeaky clean with no dryness, redness or irritation after cleansing. No stingy in eyes either.",1
looks like and feels like a paste .color all wrong,0
"I'm a loyal Ouidad user, I use botanical boost and heat and humidity gel almost daily. I bought the playcurl amplifying foam to switch it up. While my hair comes out really nice when I use it, it's been painful to wash out. It literally feels like my head is full of snarls and shampoo won't even get it out. I need to load up on conditioner just to run my fingers through my hair again. Not sure if it's something about this product when it comes in contact with water or something. It's so bad that I'm tossing a mostly full bottle.",0
"Smells great! And the packaging is ideal but it's not the best thing I've used. At least for me, not worth it and would not consider buying again.",0
Not good,0
"I think the product is good, however the smell made me nauseated and I couldn't stand to put it on my face. It was a waste of money for me.",0
"Why didn't I find out about this earlier??? Amazing for those big, painful zits that you have no choice but to walk around with for days. This definitely helps it go away so much sooner!",1
This is a nice scent that is not too powerful. It is a feminine scent but not too flowery. I would say it is what I would call more earthy. Over all this is a nice simple bottle that sprays easily. The logo is cloth stuck on the bottle. I would say that this is not a scent that would last all day. You would want to add later to maintain the scent.,1
Smells terrible and does not hold firmly.,0
"I think it works really great, and it looks amazing.  The only thing I don't like is the smell :/  it kinda smells like men's cologne.  It's not something I'll wear out because of how much I dislike the smell.  If it weren't for that, then I'd say it would be perfect if you only wanted to be tan for a day.",1
"Goes on smooth. Smoothest sunscreen I've used to date. This is my favorite sunscreen for my face after SuperGoop. I use SuperGoop CC cream but I don't use their regular sunscreen because they contain Oxybenzone. This sunscreen (and SuperGoop CC cream) does not.

The only thing is that I seem to run out of this like California is running out of water. I'll need something else to put on my body now that summer is fast approaching. Other than the price point not meeting my need to have it replaced too often, I love it.",1
I just started coloring my gray hair. The first time I did not use this product and my grays were showing after about 4 weeks with a redo around week 6.  I am now on week 5 and am not noticing any grays peeking through yet.  I'm waiting around to see when I'll need to schedule a touch up.  This is a great product that has really worked for me.,1
"I use this once a week to get rid of product build up.  It leaves hair soft, shiny and refreshed!",1
"Im not sure if its a fake or they changed the formula but Im not impressed with this cream anymore. The smell now is too strong (my husband won't kiss me after I put it on) and its very thick texture, like butter. Im very disappointed as it used to be my favorite several years ago... :(",0
"I don't know if they sent me an old product or it is supposed to be that way, but the scent of this diffuser is too weak. It was a disappointment.",0
"Unfortunately, the bottle inside the box was leaking and was all over. At $150.00 this product should come in pristine condition. Whether it works is still to be seen!",0
I was very dissapointed when I got this polish in the mail. It is way darker than the picture. I was expecting a vibrant bright blue as shown and that's far from what I got. It also dyed my nails a blue tint when I took the nail polish off.,0
"love the way this makes my hazel eyes pop, but I need to take apart to push up when out.  it should be a twist and it doesn't work",1
I love wen products but this one smelt awful I would not use this even on my dogs it was that bad. I just flushed money down the drain.,0
This shampoo is terrible--SO DRYING.,0
"After reading some of the terrible reviews I was prepared to be disappointed, but these came in great shape and I checked for the Clarisonic logo embossed on the back of it.",1
I've been using this product and haven't noticed a difference in my wrinkles yet. It's been 4 months. It's just another expensive cream.,0
Best spray ever. I have thick course long hair.,1
"Gradual, and natural looking.  The best product I have ever tried.  Lovely scent and good moisturizer are extra bennies!",1
The only complaint I have is the case falls apart even when I was very careful.,1
Arrived quickly and was just what I ordered. It's a great product and I got it for a great price.,1
not work,0
This is the only product that works for me.  Even the other formulations don't do as well as the Original formula.,1
I use this after Effaclar cleanser. It works well. I only wish it smell with something light and delicate. This toner is unscented.,1
Such a light hair spray....perfect for my hair. Love this product!,1
"The before Shave oil I think is just glycerin and not sure about the after shave lotion but I think it is shay butter.

Those two Items are fantastic. The little brush fergitaboutit.
The tube of shave creme Fergetaboutit

Like I said cost to much but the two oils are great.

dray",1
Have been using this product for years. GREAT coverage and does not look flaky. I couldn't go out in public without it!,1
"For some reason this product burned my face when I applied it, could be because my skin is sensitive but im sure it will work for others :)",0
Not at all the delicate pink I was expecting this very orange and dark.,0
Not enough foam and lather. Dries on my face too quickly.,0
It is so watered down that it takes almost the whole tube for one shampoo! Maybe I received a bad tube?,0
"I've tried the drug store brands of foundation. I've tried department store brands as well but nothing covers like this while still looking natural. Other brands tend to make you look like you have makeup on. I want it to look natural but clover up the blemishes. This product does it perfectly. I was a little hesitant buying it at first because it was so much more expensive than other brands. But I had so many compliments on how I looked I found it well worth the cost. When I ran out, I tried Aveda's brand because it was less expensive,natural and mineral based. I figured it would be similar. Not only did they have less colors to work with but the product never seemed to cover. It looked natural but with out coverage. I might as well not be wearing any base. Now I'm back to the GloMinerals brand. The color is perfect.

Try GloMinerals eyeliner pencils as well. You can blend it with the sponge tip on the other end of the pencil but it seems to stay on. It doesn't smudge and move like less expensive brands. Again, worth the money.",1
"This does not work for me to set makeup at all. It does give me a dewy, shiny look but it does not have the same fixing effect as my MAC or NYX products. It feels more like a rosewater solution that is nice over a powder foundation on dry skin. For already oily skin it may make it too shiny looking unless a matte product is used as makeup.

I do love the fragrance and the cooling feel of the mist. I think I will end up using it more during the winter than summer, or maybe even after a harsh, hot and drying day in the sun. It's a great product, it's just not very useful for me as a make-up fixing spray.",1
"I've read quite a number of reviews where this hair dryer stopped working in less than a year. It shorts out. Had it fixed twice but the same problem occurs each time after a few months of use. If you get this working, do not unplug it. It may not work again. Since Babyliss is now owned by Conair, I'm wondering why Conair doesn't fix this issue. It's the wiring.",0
"I've had these rollers for over three years.  Performance wise, it would be hard to beat them.  They heat up fast and really set a great curl.  I travel a lot and these curlers go everywhere with me. They are small and compact and fit nicely in your carry on or your checked bag. They even went to Europe w/ me, where I had no issues with the dual voltage. The only two downsides I would like to point out are 1) the plastic clips that come with the set really don't work. I kept the metal clips from my old Conair set and use those instead  They keep the roller in place very well.  On this set, ends of the roller are molded plastic.  Overtime, the heating of the plastic has caused them to crack.  It hasn't impacted the ability of the roller to heat and do its thing, but it makes handling the roller like handling a hot potato. I noticed that the T3 rollers have been updated and i just ordered a new set.  Hopefully they fixed the clips and cracked plastic issue.",1
"2 stars b/c the product itself seems good. Other than that, I just can't believe I was given a used product that was sold as new and wasn't even in its own packaged box! And the packaging was beyond AWEFUL! The flat iron had 1 flat piece of cardboard folded over it n then stuffed in an OVERSIZED box with NO shock absorber! No bubble wrap, NOTHING! You couldn't take the time to stuff cheap trash paper in it?! That would have worked just fine! But no! The iron was just put in a huge box clonking & clinking around during delivery! I'm very disappointed!",0
This is the wrong product that I thought I was ordering.... I really wanted the Bosley Revive that often sells with the shampoo and conditioner.... I need to reduce hair loss....not glue what's left to my sconce.... HMMM!,0
I only used this product for a month and it stopped working. I would not recommend wasting you money.,0
I wanted to love this product based on the reviews. It irritated my eyes. I used it two or three times and my eyes were itchy and felt like they had been scratched.,0
"I like this product, but I feel it is vastly overpriced.",1
My boyfriend loved it he now wants to get the aftershave,1
"Primarily, the color was too dark.",0
Great styling cream to use before blow drying.,1
to heavy for my hair.... greasy after a day,0
"I ordered this Elizabeth Arden set for my daughter now i got to order more .: FOR ME OF COURSE ! It smells soooo great , i love . I have been using a different brand now no no anymore , Elizabeth Arden is for me . smells sooooo good.",1
"I bought this flat iron over two years ago.  This is the first flat I've ever purchased.  I chose the BaBylissPro Nano Titanium 1"" after searching and comparing different models, different features and user satisfaction.  I am happy to report that it is still going strong!  The feature that I most appreciate is the dial that allows the user to adjust the heat.  It heats up rather quickly so you can begin to style your hair soon after plugging it in and turning it on.  I take good care of it. I clean it EVERY time after I use it.  Make sure, though, that you use some sort of heat protection on the hair to avoid burning it.",1
Get to hot,0
Too expensive and I have had better conditioners. Smells very nice!,0
"I have used many mascaras from very expensive to drug store brands.  I have had problems with a lot of them smudging under and on the lids of my eyes throughout the day.  I also work out and other mascaras would run.

Lorac pro has solved that issue.  I no longer need to worry about wiping under my eyes throughout the day or  mascara running down on my face.  Great product, will purchase again.  Bonus it makes my lashes look long and full as if I have fake lashes on.",1
"Bought this a few short months ago and today it decided that it was done working. Plugged in, full temp, NO HEAT. Waste of money. My cheapo ConAir lasted years.",0
Have used this fragrance for 8 years and I still like it.  It is a light scent that is not floral and I don't worry about using it when I am in meetings.,1
ordered 1 it fell apart. ordered 2nd it fell apart as well. trash avoid it like ebola,0
"I have used this product before many times and while I love the actual product itself, I don't feel like that is what I received. The smell is completely different than what it has been in the past and the product I received smells like just like an insanely strong chemical treatment at a hair salon. Im really disappointed after spending $30 on a product that I have always loved!",0
"This product does exactly what it says it does.  The more you play with it,the more you can change the look.  It does make your hair seem thicker.  The only draw back is that it seems like your hair is dirty if you use too much. I used it a few times, then forgot about it. I would recommend it.",1
"Best lubrication from a shave product I have ever used.  You really only need a small amount for big performance.  Only thing keeping me from 5 stars is the cost.  But honestly, it lasts a long time so it is worth the money and I keep buying it.",1
Really good scent and came in great time.,1
Good glove for exfoliating.  I just use this with warm water and I can see the dead skin come off.  It's not too abrasive but the texture makes it very effective.  I think I will get another one for both hands.,1
The item I received was a fake. Returning for a refund.,0
"I have tried many prep sprays, and I have found this one to be the best by far. My hair stylist recommended it. I used it as a prep spray after washing my hair, and more importantly, I use it the second or third day after washing my hair. It reactivates the hair product and makes it super easy to style my hair the way I want it without add more product (other than this prep spray). I have short hair, and this spray makes my life easier and makes my hair always look cute. I highly recommend it!",1
"The spray contained in this kit is of super low quality. I saw some reviews that highlighted this problem but I thought they were exaggerating. They were not. The spray is aweful and MAKES YOUR HAIR LOOK THINNER, which defeats the whole purpose of Toppik altogether. I think they tried way too hard to offer this package but failed in execution. Will not buy this lot again.",0
Rubs off on clothing and goes on uneven and off color!,0
"The pump was clogged internally after using it about 3 months. I was able to improve on this product by drilling out the existing tube, with a drill bit roughly twice the original diameter. You should consider going maybe 50 percent larger first. Drill all the way through the entire shaft till you fill the bit 'brake through' the other end. I think the hair fibers come out more evenly now, though it is likely using more product. I like this bump myself as it uses substantially less product than simply shaking it on you head.

Hope this is helpful.",1
It does cover your scalp. It is more of a dark brown.,1
"I first tried this polish at a salon for a pedicure.  The colors are very vivid and bright.  The pedicurist told me it's wear fell between regular polish and a gel polish and removed without a need to soak in polish remover.  I couldn't get it all off my toenails when it came time to remove it.  It wears like iron and won't chip; but the removal is not a great experience, especially if you're like me and won't soak in acetone.",1
Leaves a red hue in my black hair. Super noticeable. If that wasn't enough it also leaves your hair feeling sticky and hard as if you just used an entire bottle of hair spray in your hair. Back to the fibers for me.,0
I bought this item thinking it would last 7 days and it didn't even last three (even with a top coat). I bought it when it was five dollars more with three others and I feel completely ripped off. It is so not worth your money!,0
"This product is terrible. I've applied it 2 times a day for 6 weeks. No results. Expensive and does not work. Don't waste your money on this. Revitalash actually works, and is oonly slightly more expensive. Some peole said that this prodduct works so good, they had to trim their lashes. Bah! I find that hard to believe. Nothing happened to my lashes at all-- not longer, not thicker, not darker. What a sham! Don't throw your money away.",0
I ordered extra column but received damaged hair shampoo.,1
Horrible smelling Don't buy you will end up tossing it. !,0
Power cord started to shore out a year and a half into use.  I only use this at home and am not a stylist so it wasn't heavy use. I called the company and the product is only warranted for a year.  The replacement cost was $21 but buy the time you pay for shipping both ways what's the point?  My revlon brand iron lasted many years longer. Needless to say I'm disappointed since it's suppose to be a professional item that it died after light home use.,0
"This is just unbelievable! I am natural blonde and I could not find shampoo that would really work for my hair ( john frieda, clairol, etc) we have summer now my hair would lighten only on the ends the rest would look like I have dark roots I HATE IT! and I refuse to color my hair. Today this shampoo arrived, I washed my hair and let me tell you - PERFECT!!!! smells good too. I will buy it again ( and you get 2 bottles of shampoo) I also bought the conditioner - PERFECT!!!!",1
"This lipstick is so dry, it doesn't feel like any is getting on my lips. I really have to press down on it to get any color at all .. there is little feeling of moistness or any sensation at all. It might be an old tube?",0
Would not recommend.  Did not like.  Still haven't used.  Disappointed.  Doesn't really get hot.,0
"Lovely color, not too sticky and long lasting. Will buy again!",1
The product doesn't work. This doesn't turn. Please fix the problem. I payed for a new product and i need that my babyliss Pro works. Thanks,0
"The heat, even at the medium setting, was way too hot!  It was lighter than my current dryer but wasn't as light as I was expecting it to feel.  I returned this and purchased Rusk W8less which I like better.",0
"Absolutely cannot do without this serum. It is light on the face, smells good and travel friendly. For me, this is a must to use at night, and sometimes in the morning. It helps control my skin from getting dry due to weather condition and pollution. On top of this, I also use L'Occitane Shea Butter mosturizer and Sothy's facial mask to keep my facial skin supple. I love French skin products!

"I have become a fan of cleansing oil despite being skeptical the first time I tried it. It is great for when your skin is dry or more ""mature"" so you don't want to use a cleanser that is too harsh.

I am also generally a fan of the L'Occitane products. This oil does a good job of cleansing and feels very nice.  My only complaint is that it is a bit more scented (it has a flowery perfumey scent) than I would prefer.  The good news is that the scent does not linger so much that I could smell it all night, but I would still prefer less scent.  If not for the scent, I would give this 5 stars.

If you want a good cleansing oil but want less scent, I like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juice-Beauty-Stem-Cellular-Cleansing-Oil-4-fl-oz/dp/B00GTESTLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juice Beauty Stem Cellular Cleansing Oil, 4 fl. oz.</a>.",1
"Love the product, but found the pump to dispense the product had issues. Probably not the case w/ every bottle.",1
Worked great for a year.  Then the bonnet stretched so that the hose would not say in.  I don't  believe I will try a Hot Tools product again the future.,0
One of my very favorite colors.  I've bought several bottles over the past couple of years.  I'll continue to buy it.,1
"BUYER BEWARE! This has ZERO of the real Wen product benefits! This is not a genuine Wen, rather it's a bad copy. The formula leaves your hair feeling terrible, and is lumpy and reminiscent of a drugstore conditioner. In fact, it is so light to make the weight of 4oz, the bottle is twice the size of the real Wen product, which is smooth, thick and dense. Also note that to return the product, you cannot use the traditional amazon online returns center, however, if you email amazon directly they will accept the return.",0
I need more time to evaluate it better,1
disappointed it doesn't work on my hair. No texture added at all.,0
"Okay, this is, hands down, the best smelling dry shampoo ever. It also does a fantastic job of sucking up the oil in your hair. It gives great body. I really love it. My only complaint, and others probably will feel different, but I have a hard time distributing this evenly in my hair. I wish it came in a spray formula.",1
I love Ahava products.  Their scents are usually clean and fresh smelling.  I don't like the scent on this one at all.  I gave it two stars because it is moisturizing.,0
If I had received the actual product rather than an empty container I'd tell you that the product itself is great. At least when I've purchased it from other vendors.,0
"okay, so i've been hearing for this product for over a year now and know how widely touted it is by beauty & skin care aficionados, but this product did not work for me. It made me break out and did not provide any noticeable benefits. I thought the breakout may have been my skin adjusting to a new product, but it just seemed to get worse - using this for 3 weeks my skin progressively got worse and immediately improved after I stopped using it. Please note, i have sensitive skin and have experienced eczema so it may be my skin reacting poorly. I did enjoy the light scent, though.",0
Doesn't seem to do anything but shampoo and condition your hair just like any other shampoo and conditioner,0
"Normally love this brand, but this one died in 6 months time",0
"Delivered on time, overall good buy!",1
Good,1
"Used this twice a day despite a pretty weird and funky smell, but saw no improvement whatsoever by the time the bottle was gone.  It was nice and thick and felt like it moisturized, but due to the smell and lack of results I can't recommend.",0
I wanted a universal top that could fit on any top.,0
I have sensitive skin and It literally burned my skin....,0
So first off it doesn't hold a charge for more then a couple weeks. And its advertised 6 months. Second the silicone bristles fall out almost every time you brush. And now the brush has broke where its joined to the handle. And I've only had it 2 1/2 months. I wouldn't buy again.,0
Another great product form Klorane.,1
Beware buyers for fake products. I bought this item and it is supposed to pump out two serums from one bottle. One cream is orange in color and the other is red. The one i bought is only pumping out orange color cream. I think i got scammed. I've heard from other customers about serums being diluted.,0
"This color is super soft, tropical, and fun; but still a flattering neutral mango orange  fit for everyone and perfect for spring and summer. I give it 4 stars not 5 because I have a harder time applying Nail *Laquer* (OPI) than say, Essie, which I think applies and wears the absolute best. OPI's brushes are a tad larger and I make a mess. This color looks so sexy with a black outfit though.",1
Had for about a year now and still working well! Takes about 3 mins to flat iron my hair and I have med-long hair.,1
This is a great price.,1
"I've been using it for over two weeks and I honestly have not seen any difference. Save your money, it doesn't work... For me at least. :(",0
Boooooo,0
"I purchased a St. Tropez mitt from Sephora and it lasted a long time. It was cheaper on amazon by about $1 so I ordered two, and they were a waste of money, after three uses the mitts fell apart - they rip completely at the seams. I thought maybe one was defective but when it happened with the second mitt I realized these were just bad quality and now I'm reading other peoples reviews and there mitts ripped too. Don't waste your money.",0
"A very thick kind of toothpaste, doesn't really like it when it's in my mouth, but my breathe feels nice after using it.",1
"This is my favorite scent of all time! My husband likes it as well. It's a sophisticated, not too sweet fragrance that makes my entire home smell wonderfully.",1
amazing I use it till now for about a week and days I notice the difference really I like it so much the dark and puff under my eyes start to disapper alittel I will continue using it to find more effect,1
Pump broke after 2 uses. Won't even allow me to return it.,0
I have super senstive skin for a white dude.  This stuff doesn't really seem to do much for razor burn considering its high price :-/.  Two stars for the fact that it smells good.,0
One of my favorite perfumes and the fact that it is unisex is awesome. I'm gifting this for my nephew.,1
It won't last. Seems to not have a fixer or something.,0
This is not a Paul Mitchell Hair Brush.  I read the reviews and still bought it.,0
These leaked in my bag,0
Was disappointed in this scent bought it based on all the positive reviews as I did with another Lalique scent Amethyst. Have had many compliments on that one. I feel that ALL the perfume companies/sellers should put together a sample pack of small vials of all the scents they sell so that money and product is not wasted on a full bottle and charge a minimal $ amount so that people can decide whether or not the scent works for them.,0
"pretty good, saw some line improvement but  not  dramatic result",1
"Watch out for counterfeit on Amazon???! Or a lemon?

NOTE: I gave 4 stars in respect to the real Babyliss straightener. Not this dud I received.

Received mine today. The box looked legit but upon opening, I noticed that there were scratches and marks on it off the bat. The top has unfinished plastic cut. Not only is workmanship sloppy, it is not the standard of profession warranted by Babyliss Pro. (picture uploaded to Amazon)

I shared one with my roommate back in university for a couple of years. The texture of a legit Babyliss straightener glides on hair smoothly, leaves hair soft and smooth, heats up instantly, and you see results within minutes. My roommate has it for 5 years now and it is working in top-notch condition as the day she received it.

The one I received DID not do any of the above. It straightens but it is comparable to a cheap straightener from a drug store. My hair is left somewhat straight and rough. The straightener is VERY light and feels all plastic! (Granted, Babyliss straighteners are light but it doesn't feel cheap) The power cord is also loose (i.e, in the future it is very likely to not transmit not enough power to the straightener)

Anyway, I am not gonna leave the seller's name bc Idk if they know of it or not...so please, inspect yours upon arrival. Real Babyliss straightener heats up in ~30 seconds and your hair should be smooth and completely straighten. It DOES NOT take several glides to get a section straight (Mine was set at '45' which confirms my suspicions)",1
Smells delicious. Rich conditioning and beautiful color,1
The scent smelled as if it had been diluted in too much alcohol. I regret not buying the full container at a local department store.,0
It is super sticky.,0
"I bought ColorWow bc it states it's waterproof and I was going on a beach vacation. It did seem to hold up to the pool. ColorWow is a bit tedious to apply as its like an eyeshadow and you have to go over some places several times. Even then the silver is what I'd call faded not completely concealed. But, from a distance, it looks ok. Depends on how much of a secret you want your roots to be!  Also, having to use the brush to go over hair several times means it frizzed my roots a bit. Worst part of ColorWow is it transfers to your hands esp fingernails if you touch your hair. I didn't realize how much I touch my hair until this product. After a while, it made me look forward to washing it out. To help others on their quest, I'll note that I've tried two other products. ColorMark, which is like a marker, is ok but after applying enough to cover silver in some spots it got a bit cakey. So so coverage otherwise and time consuming. For me the first thing I bought at Bed Bath and Beyond, EverPro Gray Away, which is what I call a colored hairspray is the easiest and provides best coverage. Not sure of color match if my hair wasn't dark brown/black. But works best for me without grit or cake build up, quick application, and fairly full coverage. Negative would be applying close to temples/along face line as it is a spray so control isn't easiest. Still, washing my hands once after using them as a shield between hair and face, it's my go to.",0
why is the kabuki brush synthetic?,0
Great product for overworked color treated hair!! The fragrance could be better... It works  and that makes it worth the money... I have a drawer full of overpriced products that don't do what they claim....  I actually received a sample of this and liked it so much I bought it..,1
"Bought from Universal Perfumes, 3.4 oz, definitely a FAKE because I just smelled the real chrome by Azzaro last month and used it everyday till it was gone. This Azzaro from them has a very weak smell and the real chrome had a very strong odor and I'd know the real scent. The fake one has almost no scent and is mostly water it doesnt even burn my face and it should if you were to smell the real thing you'll know, and I will return the FAKE watered down chrome. Real chrome is a great scent! This is my only amazon review and I don't usually write these real chrome by azzaro is a very great product recommended to me by my girlfriends father.",1
Really small samples.  It's hard to get and idea of what will work with these little itty bitty samples.  I was disappointed that I did not receive at least one full sized product.,0
"NOT RETURNABLE !!!  Just got this and it's not what I was excepting,  I had been searching for a Butterfly razor and this came up as an Amazon Choice.  But it is clearly NOT a Butterfly Razor, it is a 3 piece razor that must be dismantled to put in a razor.
When I went to return it I found this :  This item isn't eligible for return.

Does not work except for random patches and streaks,0
"The scent.....It reminds me of witch hazel......
The lowest quality of toner and very bad scent. Would not recommend it. Maybe it was the shipper.",0
"I have been using this product as part of the Nioxin System 4 system and was running out of the third step -- the Scalp Treatment.  Because this was twice the size of the original product, I ordered the 200ml size from ""All About Hair Care.""

The product was defective, with the foam liquefying as soon as it was pumped out.  After a couple of emails back and forth with ""All About Hair Care"" they gave me a refund today.",0
I have been taking this product for a little more than a week. Within the past few days when I comb my hair... it falls out much more than I've ever seen. Ofcourse I expect some shedding when combing or shedding but the amount on my comb is DEPRESSING. I don't know what it is but I am have adverse effects from what the product promises.,0
Exactly as described. Great product!,1
"The first thing to keep in mind before buying this is that an electric shaver can never be as close as a manual safety razor blade.  Some come close but the shave will always be inferior to a real blade. The real benefit of an electric razor is that it can be used practically anywhere and it does not require shaving cream or a great deal of care to prevent nicks or cuts.  If you are ok with this fact then the LumaRx Foil Shaver is a decent choice.  It is very easy to use and comfortable.  The shave is close enough for general areas such as armpits but it won't wow you with  skin that feels silky smooth.  Most women will find this to be great for daily use but when you really need a close shave a manual is always the best choice.

*** Positive Points: ***

- Easy to charge on its included charging stand
- Has a built in trimmer that is comfortable to use
- Provides a fairly consistent shave that is reasonably close
- Has a reasonable shave time of 30 minutes per charge
- Has a nice carrying pouch and brush to help clean the razor

*** Negative Points: ***

- Charge time is very long (20+ hrs)
- Shaving foil works well in most areas but is a bit large for ""sensitive"" areas
- The instructions mention replacing the foil every 6 months which seems a little too frequent
- Shaver must be dry before charging
- No display or indicator to let you know how much charge is left",1
Skin feels like new,1
"It works well for what it is -- a way to brush kids hair without too much trouble or complaint. We've had this product previously which had a different (possibly unscented odor).  In Spring 2014, this now seems to have a sort of cherry smell, which my daughter is not fond of.",1
Too flakey!,0
The tint is dark and not suitable for fair skin.  I had to return this.,0
"Irritated my scalp more! Possibly due to all the added fragrances.

After suffering from deaths and family illnesses I was under a great deal of stress. My skin and especially hair was showing it. I started experiencing stress related hair loss really bad. I thought this was the answer to my prays but sadly I was wrong. Only did it not fix my excessive shedding it irritated my scalp so much worse. It's a shame cause I absolutely love Paul mitchell products normally but this one is overpriced and does not work!",0
Excellent product for color treated hair that keeps your hair smooth & shiny after blow drying & using a flat Iron!,1
"Once upon a time , I use to get these treatments with my facials until I evaluated my financial records and realized it was something I needed to stop. I knew I could take a vacation with the money I saved. I went on line , looking for all the items to do at home facials , came across this product , Loved it. I started seeing the results I was looking for after about 3 weeks. I don't wear foundation so an even clear complexion is important to me.",1
Great moisturizer and tint - very light not heavy one the face - wear every day - my skin looks great!,1
"Bought it after reading glorious beauty reviews by Allure.  Its gentle, but so as Cetaphil at fraction of price.",0
"I really love this color and product, and the packaging is just the cutest thing ever- BUT it does make me break out some. I do have extremely sensitive skin and it tends to hate anything near or on my lips regardless, I was hoping a lip tint would be different but it doesn't seem to be.
So, if you have normal type skin that isn't super prone to break out and other types of lipsticks and lip products don't bug you- buy this. it is nice and cute and long lasting. If you're like me though, maybe still buy it and just accept the zits that come with it. or, look for another product.",1
"I love the ""Fash Pack"" color.  I've only used it on my toenails so far so i'm really unable to say how it handles everyday wear and tear on the finger nails. But it really is a beautiful color and i look forward to using it again.",1
"Treats my 50+ year old skin gently whether removing what's left of my makeup at the end of a work day, or the end of an evening out, or when I want to treat my skin nicely before I go to sleep. I really have noticed my skin and eyes feel better especially during pollen season where the non-native scotch broom pollen creates havoc with the eyes and sinus.",1
great stuff,1
We had thus stuff in our hotel room in China this spring.  I'm looking for somewhere local to buy it.,1
"I love BB creams so I was really excited to try this. When I first got it, I was thinking, wow that's really dark. Then I noticed on the back the color says Latte. Does that mean they make more than one color? Did I get a dark color without thinking? I was hesitant to try this because it was so dark but I figured, hey, I want to see if it will help my legs with some color and to hide any imperfections I have. Applying it with a makeup sponge was fairly easy. It blended out really well but the color was just not me.

Not to mention the makeup was rubbing off on my clothing. The top of my white socks were covered. I actually felt more self-conscious going out with my legs covered in make-up than I did with them just super white. I have 3 BB creams at home so I didn't bother using this on my face because of the color.",0
"No, was it your money",0
fake product don't buy it.,0
"Amazing product for face, thoroughly recommended, long and bushy eyebrows for a better look and presentation, excellent product neulash neubrow.",1
"A great buy since the quality gel lasts for a very long time. You only need a small dime size dollop for all day great fragrance! Although more of a traditionally masculine smell, my husband and I both use this product!",1
"I love this product and been using since 1984. I was going to gift it to a friend, but I couldn't because box didn't have wrap and bottle plastic cover broken. I kept it for my self and bought another one at Macy's.",1
"I was expecting to love this, but honestly I was very underwhelmed. I'm a big fan of liquid liner pens. Kat Von D's tattoo liner is my holy grail, but I wanted to try another brand. This Stila liner goes on way too wet. I found application to be really difficult and could barely put it on without messing up the line. I would not buy this again.",0
DO NOT RECOMEND THIS ITEM. This worked just long enough to void the return policy.,0
I didn't like this product at ALL.  It clumped when I put it on.  I will never buy it again.,0
Smells terrible but works pretty good. Not good enough for the money it costs however.,0
Left my hair sticky,0
"This product is sub-par to their other dry shampoo. This new spray is just ok :(I really like their other dry shampoo that was a powder, it worked so well and didn't make my hair look powdery and it smelled great.",0
My flat iron will not fit into this holder unless I force and literally cram it in there.  I contacted the seller who was no help! When I am trying to do my hair I didn't figure I would need two hands to force it into or pull it out of the holder!! Very disappointed!,0
"I love Davines products and this conditioner is no exception.  It is nice and thick and untangles my unruly and coarse hair.  In addition, it gives it a nice luster and feel.  I recommend this product.",1
I bought this based on the good reviews and its unconventional method of operation. I like it and it seems to curl your lashed well.,1
"Was really excited to get this product as it was so highly rated, but... this product cannot handle frizz and humity nearly as well as my old ceramic flat iron. I don't think this works well as a wet to dry, and I don't think it works well on just dry hair. Wondering if the regular pronano works better? Anyway, this was a huge disappointment and I REALLY wish I could get my money back.",0
does not play any effect on skin toning after 3 months' of use.,0
It works fine but I have thick hair so I can't use it as my everyday iron  I usually use it after My hair is already straight.. Just so it feels softer.. I will probably give it away,0
"smells good! like lemon and vanilla, but all my clothes gets white powder all over it.",1
Good!,1
Doesn't work save your money,0
"Product is horrible, I have more BO than without it.",0
Fake. Last for few minetus.,0
MY FAV!!! the sweetest scent ever,1
This lip plumper goes on very smooth but it has almost no color. I won't buy it again.,0
"Smells good in  the bottle.  5 minutes after splashing it on, the scent is gone.  What a disappointment!",0
"This is a very pretty color (represented very well in the picture, too).  This eye shadow goes on smoothly with good coverage without having to ""refill"" the makeup brush over and over.  It lasts a long time without requiring reapplication which makes the original rather high price worth it.  It LOOKS GOOD for a long time.  I recommend it.",1
"I love this product. I have used it for YEARS and it locks in color and gives a beautiful result.
THIS WAS NOT ORIBE!!  Beautiful Coloris a creamy yellow and smells great. This was a fluffy white bad smelling terrible product. It MUST BE FAKE!!  How do I return it?!?  Please tell me how yo return. This is not real product. ",0
Very nice hand cream.,1
"Super light, super powerful!",1
I love this product and have been using for about 2 years. When I ordered these bottles they just had tape on the top. I am about 1/3 of the bottle and there is a STRONG chemical smell coming from the shampoo every time I wash my hair. So bad my husband actually noticed it and my hair seems to be breaking more.... in the two years I've been using this product I've never had that. The shampoo usually tingles and this one does not at all. I am thinking they added another shampoo into the bottle!!!  Very concerning and upset as it is not cheap and my hair seems to be breaking off!!!!,0
My wife used it. It's okay. The color is better if lighter a bit.,1
Quit using when I heard his products make your hair fall out,0
Both of the 2 that i ordered had a bad pump.,0
"I think this is a very good product. I saw a difference within first 3 times of use, I got too happy and raised my expectations but I didn't see more improvement after. Still hoping.",1
Super bummed. Was trashed by the time it got to me. Would not recommend.,0
"This is not really what I was expecting - it goes on thinly and not moisturizing.  It can sometimes leave a film on my skin that rubs off.  Additionally, it has caused my skin to start breaking out.  I won't be finishing the bottle and would not recommend this to anyone.",0
"This product serves well as a lip gloss, but it does nothing to boost lips.",0
Amazing hair mask!,1
Can't see why anyone would use this.  It's not very practical and doesn't really clean your face.,0
Love it. Just lorac!,1
"I read all the reviews on Amazon for this curling iron and was so excited to receive it.  However, as soon as I plugged it in I could tell something was off.  I couldn't tell if it was heated up all the way because it still felt warm... so I waited 5 more minutes and no change... in a lot of the reviews people said it only took 30 seconds to heat up!  Not mine... after 15 minutes on the highest heat setting, I could still touch the barrell.  So upset!  I got this curling iron to replace a bad quality Revlon brand one from the drugstore that barely curled my hair.  But with this iron, I don't see any difference.

I am positive that Hot Tools is a great brand, but I'm also convinced I got a knock-off.  I ordered from the lowest-priced seller, which happened to be ""Amazon.com.""  If I were to do it over again, I would ORDER FROM A SMALLER SELLER.  I was enticed by the free shipping, but I would pay shipping all over again just to get the real thing from a more legit seller.  Be careful who you buy this iron from, you could get a knock-off!!!!",0
"I got a trial bottle and fell in love! Within days my skin became smooth and more radiant!
Where do I start? Enzyme Cleansing Gel is a fantastic everyday facial cleanser, it's gentle, it contains fruit acids as Alpha hydroxy therapy-- yet even as a basic cleanser and not a heavily medicated face wash, it keeps my breakouts under control. I've never found a product that does that, and I am amazed. I am now a Mario Badescu convert--their products are top quality and fairly affordable. I'm really happy about an 8 oz bottle for $12, which should last me about 3 months. You can't beat that deal. I also got the Special Cucumber Lotion & the AHA Botanical Body Soap because I was so excited about the results and price.

My skin type is combination, and even after going on a prescription topical regimen which seriously improved my skin, I still couldn't kick some minor breakouts. I'm so glad I found this product, it makes an even bigger difference. What do you have to lose? Try it, it might work for you :)

UPDATE 9/5/13> I currently started using the Botanical Facial Gel, it's comparable to this but more specialized for combination/oily-acne prone; if you use the Enzyme gel and love it but it's not kicking breakouts enough for you. It's really hard to choose between both though; either is fantastic.",1
Went on streaky and the color on nails really isn't like the bottle I would not purchase this brand for nail polish again.  Very sorry and I like Crabtree and Evelyn products,0
Definitely a long lasting lipstick. Great colour. Matte. A little drying but otherwise great! Best coral lip colour I have come across. Brings out blue eyes.,1
Where you are receiving this product? This is not an original Obagi cream. Take a look at this image of the Obagi website.,0
t's a good product.,1
Basically .. save yourself some money ... burn a cigarette.... and use the ashes ... it's pretty much the same thing ...it might even work better then this crap .,0
Seems as though my eyes look worse when I use this!,0
my husband's favorite,1
"I love the product, this is my second time buying it. It has saved my nails from drying soaps and from an irresponsible amount of gardening without gloves on.
Problem is, this is my second time buying it because the first bottle dried up long before it was gone. I wasted at least a third of it. I'll keep buying the product because it works wonders, only this time I'll be more careful about closing the lid tightly when I'm storing it and hope it lasts a little longer.",1
This goes on beautifully.  Not smelly or too thick or greasy.,1
"This product smelled great and I've had success with other Jack Black products.  Unfortunately, this scrub inflamed by razor burn instead of soothing it.

 I've found a non-soap based face wash followed by a wash cloth, for exfoliation, then shave oil, then shave soap, lathered with a badger hair brush, minimizes my  razor rritation.  I keep the force to a minimum; from face wash to shave.",0
"I wanted to love this, but I guess it's not just for me. It starts off matte, but my skin looks gross within an hour or two. I will say it didn't seem to make me break out, and I didn't burn. But for the price, it didn't perform as I expected.",0
this really works. life safer for when you need another day before washing.  easy to use.  better than aerosols.,1
Great cover of thin edges! Product works well!,1
"When I gave this tube a squeeze, I was surprised at the relative thinness of the product. I was expecting a thick creme that I would have to rub between my hands until it was warm/thin enough to work through my thick, Eastern-European, too-long, wavy hair (trust me, it can be an unruly mess). So, already I was impressed. Then, I caught the light fragrance. It's a little perfume-y ... in a really good way. So, I worked a moderate amount through my hair, stacked it in a bun and pinned it there for about an hour. And, man, when I unpinned it, that gorgeous fragrance just surrounded me. Super appealing!

Now, the first time, I make the mistake of combing my hair. It gain about double the volume and looked insane. The second time I used it, I ran my fingers through my hair instead ... and, presto! Beautiful, loose, defined curls as well as volume. Therefore, you may wish to skip the comb/brush. And, soft? Oh my gosh, each curl is genuinely touchable-y soft. My boyfriend just loves touching my hair ... what a nice bonus!

Not only does this smell heavenly, but the overall look is gorgeous! Genuinely recommended!",1
"I like wearing neutral color on my nails and I usually love Essie.  I went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  I was disappointed with the product.  It goes on with lots of streaks.  It needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  I stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  I doubt that I would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but I will experiment.  It is a good color for the office, but I still wish that it was less ""watery"".",0
Stopped spraying after a few days. Total disappointment,0
"Wow!! This product works really well and not heavy at all. Put on wet to curly gstyles and on wet for roller styles. Makes hair shiney and make sure to stray all over, even ur ends, but not to much.",1
"This picture does not match the product I purchased. Most people would be happy to recieve a pump top dispenser, I just found it odd that the picture and the product did not match. Other than that, the product is perfectly fine and I have no issues.",1
Stung my skin really bad couldn't use,0
"I'm very happy with this after shave.  It's not over powering.  Be careful when ordering as the amount is US funds.  Therefore, you will see it's on par with other retailers.",1
Really like the shade of this lipstick but recommend using a lip brush to get more even coverage.,1
Defective - Product wouldn't come out.,0
Smells good. Feels fresh on skin. But on the product it says to rinse off after 5 minutes and the title here says it is a peel off.,1
received with thanks,1
Just not at all what i wanted,0
Too strong for me . lightens first night then darkens skin be careful or it will burn skin very easily,0
This product has such a strong flowery perfum smell that lasts for hours and I can actually taste. I absolutely hate it and will be returning it today. I can't believe anyone actually uses this on their face!!!,0
"Color is so different, n broken....",0
I believe this is not authentic. Smell wears off in less than 2 minutes. You can literally spray it 50 times on you and no one can smell it.,0
"Like other reviewers have stated, this product works well on acne that is just starting under the skin. Once it's surfaced and has become inflamed, it takes a bit longer for the lotion to work. But I was surprised that it did reduce the size and redness (making it easier to hide with concealer).",1
Amazing product!,1
"This is a perfect red color. It is my go-to winter/holiday color. I get many, many compliments on it and am happy I have it to use.",1
"I purchased this for my sisters long, thick hair.  This straightener has lasted years.  It beats out all other top straightener brands!",1
heads up lightening fast..very cute purple*..works great i wonder if they make these smaller as well..ill be looking i love this thing : ),1
"great tool, heats quickly, like the swivel cord didn't have that before and now I see how it's easier to handle that way. I use this more for a wavy look for my hair, love it",1
Not the same formula.,0
"I've never been pregnant but I have lateral hip stretch marks from growing 6"" in a year in high school. They are easily irritated and prone to dermatitis. I also have a large thoracic scar from childhood heart surgery. This also is prone to be irritated by nearly anything.

This cream s a great balm and protectant for scars and stretch marks. It is a white cream that goes on clear. It is not sticky or greasy. It does not stain my clothes. It has significant reduced redness and localized dermatitis on my scar. I also like that this product has a safety strip to prevent tampering.

The fragrance is different than other Mustela products, like a light floral. It is pleasant and does not bother me or make itself known. Just FYI, this cream has uses beyond pregnancy concerns. I like it a lot.",1
"The ""volumizing"" is non-existent, however, it does leave your hair smelling great",0
"Great color but not the same as the picture, actually is a little darker. For now it has been an excellent choice for muy hand allergies.",1
"I recently introduced this oil cleanser into my routine as I've been trying to follow the Korean beauty routine (google it). I love it and it smells great. I'm on my 2nd bottle. Some have said that they don't feel that it washes off all their makeup. I do not believe this is a product that should just be used on it's own. I use a makeup wipe first to get off the majority of my makeup, then I use this, then I use a water-based cleanser, and then a toner because I lotion. This has worked great for me but if you are a one product type gal, this might not work for you.",1
Pump was broke,0
I love the tingling sensations and the smell. I have noticed tighter skin and couldn't be more happy with this product. If you want to try it then do because it is definitely worth it. I like it the best out of any of the other fat girl slim products.,1
Seems to work. Leaves a residue in the morning that's kind of hard to wipe off.,1
"When I received this product it was broken in the package, there was nothing protecting it from being able to break nor a fragile sign to warn people thats its breakable",0
I have ordered 2 and the cap broke on both!! Love the product but packaging is dreadful. Expect more for the price!,0
Great product! Fast delivery!,1
"This concealer is amazing! I have terrible skin: large pores, acne, scars, etc.and this makes my skin look FLAWLESS. I was initially worried that it wouldn't last the whole day, but this stays on for a regular work day as well as a night in Vegas. I seriously cannot get over how great I look with it on. I don't even have to use foundation which is really helping with my skin issues. I would recommend this to any of my friends.

If you're trying to figure out which shade you should get. I would find one that's very close to your natural skin color, and then get a shade lighter. It blends in seamlessly with just a little bit of powder to set everything.",1
"I used this product in conjunction with Volumea Shampoo in hopes that it would give volume to my fine hair.  I used it for three days and the only thing it gave my hair was more static electricity.  I live in Utah, and maybe it would be more effective in a more humid climate.  So unless you live in the tropics, have money burning a hole in your pocket or are performing a scientific experiment I would refrain from buying this product.",0
Been using this product for a long time and I love it.,1
Awful!,0
"I've used Rusk Smoother Conditioner for several years and was distressed when I could no longer find it in my local beauty supply stores.  Fortunately, I found it on-line. I have thin very fine hair and most conditioners just weigh it down, making it look thinner and flatter. Rusk Smoother does neither.  It just calms down the frizzies and adds shine. Sometimes I even use it after I use a rinse-out conditioner that is supposed to add body.  Both still work even when used in tandem.  Love it!",1
This product is not Surface. Not sure what it is but its watery and smells horrible. Do not buy this from Glow Distributor - its a scam and they won't refund me my money,0
Color doesn't fade!,1
It smelt watered down with a weird spice smell. Definitely not the real thing. Who ever is selling this is ripping people off. Won't order it on amazon again.,0
"Love this product! Recommended by my esthetician. Has worked great for my pale, acne prone skin. Goes on smoothly and feels light. Best of all, it was cheaper than other online stores. Usually runs around $25. Happy with this purchase!",1
Gentle and easy to use. I've found it leaves my skin smoother in the morning. Like it. I only use it at night as I tend to wake up with dry skin. That isn't an issue with this duo. Pleasant smell too.,1
Love this product.,1
I don't sugest anyone by this - terrible tool to use. RIght size curling iron but not the style expected,0
Felt like baby oil. Very heavy on the skin. Broke my skin out.,0
This perfume is a fake. Its seems to just be watered down alcohol. I bought it as a gift and was VERY disappointed.,0
"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1
When I receive the producthalf of the bottle all pour outIt is so dirty,0
"I ordered this perfume not sure if it was for a man or a woman based on the description.  Im happy to say, it is a womans perfume so I got lucky since that was what I was hoping for.

I realize liking or disliking a smell is a very personal thing, but I really like this.  It is kind of a combination of sweet, light floral, and musk.  Now, let me say, usually as soon as I see the word musk I head the other direction, but combined with the other scents, it is very pleasant.

This perfume has staying power too.  I squirt one squirt on my shirt in the morning and it is still very much there when I take the shirt off to go to bed.  Honestly, this probably has more staying power than any perfume Ive ever owned.  I think this might be a perfume that would be easy to overdo just because the scent doesnt dissipate much at all throughout the day.
Overall, Im very pleased with the product and would most definitely recommend it.",1
"I read reviews on this product before purchasing it at Costco and many people have nice things to say about it.  However, one review I read was from a dermatologist, who just made the comment that creams that work on stretch marks and wrinkles are different.  Anti Wrinkle creams need to relax the skin and stretch mark creams need to tighten the skin, so it's believable that it would do one, but not both.

That said, I decided to go ahead and give it a shot.  To start, it's a nice smelling moisturizer.  But the first week, it caused me to break out (I have sensitive skin).  Still, I persisted.  The breakouts eventually went away, but I used it for about two months and saw no noticeable difference in my fine lines on my face.  I have returned to my old standby moisturizers and my face feels much better for it.

I have not used it on stretch marks, but since I have quite a bit left, that it what it is relegated to now.  If I notice a difference in stretch marks, I will update my review, but for now it is not worth the cost.  You can get much better for less.",0
"Works well. I have some ""bulletproof"" eyeliner that this is great for. Just not crazy about how $$ this is..I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts and so far this works well for me.",1
Excellent!,1
Creates a nice lather and feels cool in the summer. The sandalwood (red) is great for winter.,1
This is the best curling iron I've ever had. Even better than the Chi Irons I used to but that were super expensive. I wish it had auto turn off but other than that - perfect!,1
"The formula for this frgrance has been changed.  That is why many long time users are disappointed.  This was confirmed when two months ago I was in their shop in
Brussels and was told they had changed the formula..I did not purchase as I smelled it and did not want it.  Too unfortunate.  I had used Mure et Musc for 30 years, my signature fragrance.",0
I got this after reading great reviews but it didn't hold my hair at all. I wanted to try a different hairspray than I was using so I bought this. I would not buy it again.,0
This product is worthless. I didn't see any improvement in my skin after using it serveral times. A big waste of time and money.,0
I like this Essie color. This was my favorite color for a long time! I used the whole bottle!,1
These things are amazing. They work really fast and make tired under eyes look fresh again.,1
Was not happy with the item it didn't have a covered top it looks like its been used help what to do!!!,0
"If you do drag, it barely removes the makeup.  I'll stick to my wipes, thanks.",0
"Still a great product. This one was not compatible with my skin type, though.",0
Great lotion funny smell still love it though,1
"I was hoping this was like other self adjusting where if you are fair it is lighter and will adjust warm or cool to your skin tone.  Not. So,this is a bright pink and stays bright.  I am 55 and  want a 'happy' pink and not a dull pink but also do not want a bright hot pink.
This may self adjust to light, med, dark skin but it is bright pink no matter what skin it is on.",0
I don't hate the product but i think this is fake. The bottles are diferent from one another.,0
I really like this stuff.  Only thing for me is i have fine hair so i have to be careful not to use too much or it weighs down my hair & makes it feel goopy.  But i use other stuff with it like a serum and a thickening spray & as long as i keep this to a dime size it works very nicely.  The shampoo & conditioner are AMAZING!!!,1
Bought as a gift for my daughter in law.  Saw her at a New Years Eve party and her hair looked very nice.  She said she like it very much.  She is 23 yrs. old.,1
"This cream is easy to apply. It doesn't smell bad and the roller does an okay job at application, although I found it easier to spread the cream with my fingertips.  I used the cream for 10 days and did not notice any change to the crepey appearance on the skin of my neck. However, my skin did turn red. The package directions insert said if skin is sensitive, apply sparingly for 7 to 10 days to allow time for the skin to adjust. My skin looked just as red after 10 days so I ceased using it. Still, the fine crepey lines were still there and my neck did not look tighter. While I didn't expect a change to my profile or age-related sagging, since that's impossible with a skin cream, I hoped the crepey appearance would be improved. I'm assuming this topical cream contains an ingredient that tightens as it dries, much like the egg white trick.

I was curious about the claims in the description, such as stating 86 percent felt tighter skin. I wrote the company to ask how many people were surveyed, was this a clinical study, and what were the average ages of those who participated. It's been 10 days and they still have not responded.

This is not a product that I would recommend to my own family and friends. I found that it did not live up to the claims of tightening my skin. It is a decent moisturizer and works as well as any drugstore product. However, I don't think it's worth the high price, especially since many people get bad reactions from the niacin ingredient in the cream. That's just my personal opinion.",0
"I have horribly dry hands most of the time but am not the biggest fan of hand creams because of the greasy feeling they leave.  This hand cream is light but incredibly moisturizing and its absorbed into the skin quickly so there's not that off-putting greasy feeling.  I leave a tube on my desk at work & try to remember to reapply it throughout the day.  My only complaint is the smell; as someone mentioned, it smells like eau de grandma.  But other than that, I'm pretty satisfied with this hand cream!",1
Very pretty color. I take it with me so that my manicurist can apply it to my nails when I get a mani. It's great for touch ups. Nice pretty neutral color. Wear it a lot.,1
"You might as well get a salt-shaker, fill it with finely ground garden dirt and shake it onto your hair. All it does is coat your scalp with a nasty dark residue. I ordered medium brown, which was actually almost black. It does nothing to thicken your hair or even give the appearance of thicker hair. you wind up with a dirty looking scalp and dull, dusty hair. A total waste of money.",0
i love the color,1
This turned my hair to straw and then was too hard to return.,0
Not particularly moisturizing.,0
"I love this stuff. My skin is pretty good but starting to show some lines. Most foundations and even BB creams just seem to show the lines more. This is the only one I've found that lessens the lines and makes my skin look younger and fresher. It also evens out the skin tone nicely. After moisturizer, I apply this alone then just some pressed powder. I'd give it five stars except that it smells toxic like house paint! Also, it is a bit dark for a cream that only comes in one shade. My skin is light and a bit olive/yellow.",1
NOT PLEASED,0
Nice power but a little heavy,1
Thanks.....,1
"It hasn't taken years off my eyes/face as others wrote but I have to say this is my new go-to day eye cream. It's extremely moisturizing w/o being greasy or causing me to have any of the under eye concealer I apply pill up or look chalky (which is the usual problem I run into w/eye creams). I do wish they used a clear bottle so that I'll be able to tell when the product is getting low. For a night time eye cream I LOVE Annemarie Borlind's - it's extremly rich & moisturing; unfortunalty I have really bad dark circles so I use 3 concealers & this cream causes thm to not stay on as long so I now use it just for night time. BTW, if anyone else has severe under eye circles & has found some holy grail of eye cream or concealer I'd love it if you could share the details w/me!",1
My favorite one! Very soft for my sensetive skin. I am allergic and I don't have a problem after using. Thank you!,1
Great price,1
"This conditioner keeps my hair healthy!  I have fine wavy hair, and this conditioner seems to control static. It lets my wave push into place with my hands and when my hair is dry I run my fingers through it instead of a comb. (Or a slight brush or comb  hear and there and my hair looks great!)  I believe after using this volume bloom conditioner for several years It is good for hair!!!  I love it!",1
Seriously. A muslin cloth works as well as this. I regret buying it..,0
This stinks really bad! Unfortunately I waited too long to use it otherwise I would return it. It smells horrible and will not use it on my hair.,0
I love most Jack Black products but this one didn't work for me.  I have thick hair as is and it seems my favorite shampoo (Joe) is being phased out so I wanted to try something new.  This left my hair feeling stripped and kind of flat.  Returned.,0
"Used this product thrice, but never got satisfactory results. The applicator gets plugged every time (all the powder formula compacts in the tip so that nothing can come out). Eventually had to unscrew the cap and sprinkle the powder directly on scalp, which made application a little uneven. At most, I could delay washing my hair by a day. Regular baby powder seems to work better.",0
Not what I expected. Missing tools.,0
"I use the Total Anti-Aging Serum at night, below the Image Ageless Total Repair Creme. It feels really good to apply it, my skin feels more hydrated. I love the way my skin looks and feels in the morning.",1

"Does not thicken, as if I didn't use any product at all. Very disappointed. This one says level 3, not sure if other radicals have different levels of strength? This one was ineffective.",0
It's the only product I can put on my face without breaking out I love Meaningful Beauty,1
I use this serum after I wash my face and it supports and encourages a healthy complexion.  I would recommend this others with sensitive and problem skin.,1
"THIS DARN flat IRON shuts off all the time !!! The button to turn it ""on ""is in the WORST spot.
When doing my hair or a clients hair it goes off. CONSTANTLY.THEN  non-Stop checking the light to make sure it wasn't accidentally shut off.
Light weight and thin -but the plate grabs the end of your hair. Good concept.
Pro: lightweight and thin- CON; ""on/OFF"" in WRONG PLACE !!",0
"Especially the detangled for wet hair, works perfectly to detangle my fine wet hair without breaking or pulling hair out.",1

"I've only been using this product for a couple of weeks, but it IS working.  Don't think others can tell, but I can.  My chin is a bit tighter.  Hope it continues to tighten.",1
"Unfortunately, this product arrived damaged.  Bottle seems to be almost empty.  Not sure if it pays to return.",0
The product arrived with no protection so the product was leaking all over the plastic.,0
Smells fantastic but I haven't seen much skin improvement.,0
Refreshing product with pleasant aroma. Have been using safety razor shaving for nearly 2 years. Merkur blades and proraso products have nearly eliminated my razor burns problems that I experienced using Gillette Mach blades and shaving gels.,1
I wish it came with an applicator,1
"This product contains Octocrylene, which ""can penetrate into the skin where it acts as a photosensitizer. This results in an increased production of free radicals under illumination. Free radicals are known to induce indirect DNA DAMAGE and an increased concentration of free radicals might have contributed to the increased incidence of malignant melanoma in sunscreen-users compared to non-users.""  This is from a peer-reviewed, science journal.

The other active ingredient, avobenzone, easily penetrates the skin and is a strong free radical generator as well.

The whole purpose of sunscreen is to protect you from damage, not CAUSE it.

A much safer option is a sunblock - zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. They are photostable when exposed to radiation-aka sun rays and scatter the light rather than absorb it. They also protect BOTH kinds of harmful sun rays(UVA and UVB).

FYI: you should also avoid sunscreens containing PABA (causes breakouts and a possible carcinogen) and any other benzene compounds.",0
"Works I guess. I so don't like the texture it leaves in my hair. The smell is weird. Don't leave it in too long as you shave your legs or something. After I put in hair and leave in for a bit, some kinda runs onto my face. It's a weird sensation, like a unpleasant residual film is left. Ick!",0
"This product is fantastic. Unfortunately, like the others, the nozzle failed. Have a full can I cannot use.",0
"Does what it says. Really great idea, but upon using it, it appears to have many of the same  characteristics of white glue...which would probably do the same thing. Probably wouldn't buy again.",1
My mom loved it!,1
Ive been using this for a few weeks.  Im not really a fan.  The grit is WAY too large.  Ive used several other brands of face scrub.  Some have a lot of grit. . . . some not so much. . . but Ive never used one that had such large girt as this.  Its simply uncomfortable.,0
"I previously used this product, but purchased from urban outfitters, and loved it. When I ran out I knew I had to get more so I turned to amazon to get some but unfortunately as soon as I started to use this my skin started breaking out. A few days ago I stoped using it and my skin has been making a fast recovery from the breakout.",0
works well,1
Made my hair look dirty and filmy.  Not very attractive on,0
"This stuff is wonderful. I live in Colorado and it's super hydrating, but somehow it is not greasy either. I am acne-prone and this has never caused a breakout for me, while many other products (especially thick moisturizers) do. You only need a small amount for it to work well. I use it before bed.",1
"The seller of this product conveniently omits the ingredients with the product description and the jar it arrives in has a sticker (that by the way is very difficult to remove) conveniently over the  ingredients list!  I was shocked to discover that the first ingredient in this product is ACETONE!  a quick internet search indicated that acetone is highly toxic and shouldn't be used on the skin.
There are so many other products available on Amazon that are safe and more effective and sold by reputable sellers.  You can easily and safely make your own glycolic pads by diluting glycolic acid with distilled water.  1 part distilled water + 1 part 30% glycolic acid = 15% strength, 3 parts distilled water + 1 part 30% glycolic acid=7.5% strength.  An aspirin added to the solution with include the salicylic acid found in the glycolix 10-2 pads without the harmful Acetone and for a fraction of the cost.  I make a fresh combination of the distilled water & glycolic acid about once a week.  Vitamin C can also be added and lemon juice can be used safely for pigmentation issues.",0
I just order it when she needs more. So it must be good if she has me re-order it. This the 2nd time I have ordered it but a different seller this time.,1
The shampoo was good but the pump for the bottle was broken so it is hard to get the shampoo out.  Should have packaged item better.,0
For the price there just wasn't enough coverage.  My $2.00 powder was better.,0
"great perfume, i also love this and FAME by Lady Gaga, my two favs",1
Keeps your hair conditioned for a long long time. Very good product.,1
Overpriced for tiny can. Purchased full size at Ulta Beauty for same price.,0
Works well,1
"Shaving with a blade can leave my skin irritated.  I use Nivea lotions typically to try to moisturize and soothe my skin after shaving. This Jack Black is a premium alternative.  It is very light and has little fragrance.  But it works.  I notice less redness, and my skin feels cooler and less raw with this product.",1
"I like this sunscreen very much. It is a smooth, silky cream that goes on very matte and light. It has an extremely delicate and pleasant scent that is very refreshing. This sunscreen should be used in conjunction with a moisturizer, as it has limited moisturizing properties. A couple of things to note, this product is not waterproof. If you get wet or are sweating a lot, you will have to re-apply it. And, like many high-end skin care products, it is pricey. I wouldn't mind the price very much, except, for one glaring issue. The bottle I received expires in August, 2017. That is about 7 months from now. Granted, I will probably use up the product during that time, especially with the arrival of Spring and Summer. However, if I had purchased this product for myself, I would have been very disappointed with the shelf life. (There is a chance that the distributor provided Vine reviewers with an older product sample, so I have to give them the benefit of the doubt, if that happens to be true.) But, I would strongly suggest that buyers of this sun care product check the expiration date on their bottles before they use the product. If it is less than a year, I would suggest they contact Amazon customer service, because, to me, that is unacceptable. No one should have to spend any amount of money on an old, about-to-expire, skin care product.",1
"Great daily moisturizer - good base for makeup, as well.  I will  buy this brand as long as I can.",1
"This candle leaves a beautiful pleasant fruity aroma in the house. I love it. Unlike some candles I've used, this is not overpowering and lasts for ages. I recommend it to all fragrant candle lovers.",1

"This brand really suits my daughter. She used it when she was 1 month old. She had diaper rash while whe was admitted in NiCU, when she got home i used this cream, she did not have allergies to it and rash was gone. Recently  she again developed diaper rash because of diarrhea and i initially used a different brand. Her bum was totally red and itchy. I realized that she was allergic to it thus i ordered Mustela for her. This is perfect and i definitely recomment it.",1
"I did a lot of research on rolling hairdryers before buying this, including reading reviews of products on Amazon.  The model I have is BABHHDRIW.  My hair is fine, normal porosity, normal elasticity, and I have a lot of it.  In summer, I let it dry on its own, but in winter it takes hours and it's too cold to run around with wet hair.  I'm newish at curly hair, having always used round brushes and hand drying sections at a time to style.  In Southern California heat, it is too curly to maintain a smooth style, so I've been experimenting with products, sites, and equipment.

This Babyliss ProThermal roll-about drier is perfect.  It is quiet - more a hum - but you may not want to have a conversation while it's on high and someone is speaking from the other room.  I roll it out and sit under it while doing my makeup, leaving the clips in at the roots while it dries.  Within 10-12  minutes, my scalp and whole head are dry enough to remove the clips.  If you have longer hair - mine is just past my shoulders when dry - the ends may be set but still feel a bit damp.

The dryer was easy to put together; no need to be mechanical.  A couple of rods that go together and the base screws on (you might want a wrench to tighten) and the bonnet slips on at the top.  Very stable, not tippy, weighs maybe 15 pounds altogether.  No frizz, doesn't blow your hair like a wind tunnel - there are three settings, including a no-heat one with just light air.  I love it.

A great site is [...] - use their hair analysis with product suggestions.  They are really nice and got me started with answers to emails and questions.",1
Love this product,1
This polish is not as it appears ...very pinky silver and dated looking...most disappointing.  Also I could have sworn when I ordered the polish Amazon said I could return it but now it says I cannot??  I'm noticing you really have to look closely AFTER items are in cart.  Some of my prime noted items did not arrive quickly others I even canceled due to delays...  ??  Love OPI as a product just disappointed the color is not as it is described or pictured,0
"I like this shave soap a lot.  It has a pleasant smell, lathers pretty easily and yet offers a nice protection.  I've used about a dozen different soaps to shave with during the past 40 years, and this is one of the better ones!",1
"One of my favorite scents and one I am quickly adopting as my signature scent is Calvin Klein's Euphoria. It's got this woodsy, yet feminine and floral scent that I just love.

I loved Euphoria so much, I thought I would expand to try Calvin Klein's other scents. Hence why I chose Eternity Aqua, a scent that's been around since 2012.

Top notes - White peony, crisp pink lady apple and cucumber water
Mid notes - Tiare, magnolia, gardenia, jasmine
Base notes - Sundrenched woods, cedarwood, transparent musk

When I used Eternity Aqua, the words that came to mind were ""fresh summer breeze at the beach"" and ""clean"". The cucumber was definitely apparent to me, not so much the peony or the apple. It almost smelled more like clean towels or blankets without the nasty chemical scent. After a while, it settled into light, airy floral mix - I can't say that I detected gardenia and jasmine, but it was a light floral scent, not too heavy and still harkening to spring and summer and sitting by the beach.

The scent lasts a decent amount of time. The initial spray isn't too strong, and it lasts about the standard 15 - 30 minutes. The next few hours, the scent is much, much more muted - I found I had to sniff the application spot to detect it (though to be honest, isn't that what adjusting to your own scent is all about?). I think I can go about an entire work day with the scent on. One of the things I do love about the scent is that it isn't too strong and in your face. It smells clean and breezy, not too girly, not too husky.

That said, I don't know that I would put this as one of my ""signature scents"". I like girly scents like ""Intimately Beckham"", but it smells just a wee bit too ""clean"" like detergent for my tastes. But it's a great scent for a day on the beach or for summertime or to give yourself a nice aroma without burdening your coworkers with a nasty scent.

"Unfamiliar with hairdryers, our last one shorted at the cord, I ventured to research online and at Target Stores, Wal Mart, Bed Bath and Beyond only to discover selections at the physical stores were underwhelming. On-line everything with apparent quality seemed to be overpriced.

In my mind, buying something with a 2000 Watt Motor would be so fast and furious my hair would be dry so much faster, not so. Honestly, I can't tell the difference between a 1875 Watt Motor and a 2000 Watt motor as far as power/air pressure are concerned.

However, I took the plunge and paid extra, in part for the 2000 Watt Motor, and the other part because we do have a travel Babyliss 1500 Watt Motor and does a great job for such a small dryer.

PROS:

QUIET - Amazing, this things make half the noise of regular dryers

LIGHTWEIGHT - Crazy, it weighs the same as some of the travel ones

LONG CORD - This was an unexpected plus

COOL TO TOUCH - The housing never heats up

HOT - The heat this thing blows is amazing as well, like a small furnace!

CONS:

PRICE - I am really happy with the product but still feel I could have paid $20 bucks less for this hairdryer.

LOOSE CONCENTRATOR - It fits just fine, and won't come off during one dry, however, as you use put the dryer down a few times with the concentrator on, it will start to come loose and eventually fall off. No big deal, however, I never remember having this issue with other dryers, it seemed once that thing was one I had to force it off!

Asides from that I would have given this product 5 stars if it was priced a bit better.",1
"Not what I expected. I bought this based on Consumer Reports rating as one of the best.  I believe CND was ranked in the top 3.  On me, it had virtually no staying power.  I used it with CND's own nail color, and everything started to peel in just a couple of days.

I did much better with Sally Hanson Nail Shine Miracle Top Coat, which has become virtually impossible to find in stores. Lately I've been able to get it only through Amazon.  In the past I'd spent as much as $20 a bottle for nail color, thinking the more expensive would last longer.  Come to find out Sally Hanson ($2 to $6) and Sinful Colors ($2, also recommended by Consumer Reports) outlasts them all: 7-10 days and beyond.  FYI:  I wear only sheer, shimmery colors, which I've been told last longer anyway. I don't know how long either of these brands last with regular glossy or matte colors.",0

"Im pretty pale, it does not give me an orange tint but thats about all i like from this product. Most of the color washes away when i shower it off (even after i have it on all through the night) does not give me the dark color i desire.

No expiration date on product and smelled strong. Did not appear to be the same item I am used to. Not sure if it is the real thing. Did not use and will not reorder.,0
It straightens with ease. I love it. The only complaint is the white coating is already coming off. For a professional product it shouldn't be doing this in this short period.,1
"best thing out there! I used to use this cream but stopped because I couldn't afford it. When I purchase from my dermatologist it is over $100. Saw it here for less and bought it again.

"I have long fingernails and I do nail art.  I find this oil does a few things that keep me using it everyday:  it absorbs quickly and well, it protects your nails and makes them harder, it promotes growth of the nail,  and generally keeps the cuticle and nail healthier and less prone to flake, chip or break.  I purchase this oil from Amazon or BeBeautiful and it is good every time.  (I have purchased this oil from a third party seller where the oil was not the way it should have been).  I recommend this oil from these sellers.",1
"I bought this because of the good ratings and am still hunting for stuff to deal with my thick, curly, coarse, long hair that is colored monthly and would be all grey if I didn't color it, so that might explain some of my problems with conditioning.  The first time I used it, it didn't seem to do anything more than if I sprayed my hair with water, and I can do that for free.  So, I decided to spray a lot of it, and the baby powder smell (some chemical?) really irritated my lungs and sent me running for my inhaler - I have asthma.  Now natural products and high end products never bother me; it is only chemical laden products and cheap products that cause this reaction.  At first I wasn't going to send it back, but now that it makes me ill to use it, I am sending it back.

"Great conditioner that is lightweight and hydrating. I find that amika products work best together (shampoo and conditioner). I've noticed pairing this with the shampoo (Rx version) that my hair no longer has a film on it, is very curly/wavy, and feels amazing. Each time I use it my hair feels more like soft hair and not waxy or ""fake soft."" The only con I have is my hair is thick/coarse and long (hip-length), making my ends pretty dry. This isn't enough to make my ends happy, which I expected. I apply a mask each time to the 3"" of my tips which does the trick.

PS: Be cautious when you buy this product online, it isn't always genuine. My review is for the genuine product.",1
Hard to work with and smells nasty,0
This is probably my new favorite moisturizer because it doesn't make your face shiny! Love the pleasant smell and it keeps your face from drying! Just wish it was a bit cheaper cause it only lasts me about a month.,1

It dries up hard like you put a gel on.  Then it is quite hard to comb after it dried.  I will stick with the Follicle Booster.,0

"Mixed feelings about this Opi Lacquer Remover.

Pros:
Polish comes off very easily
No extra motions needed if you are removing regular nail polish.
I have not tried gel polish.
I only need to use a small amount on each nail.
Bottle contains enough remover to last a long time.

Cons:
Left my nails feeling very dry, not as advertised.
Acetone odor very high.

I had used a non acetone polish remover,and it worked very well. However,I'm have not been able to find that brand. I will continue using this brand of lacquer remover until the bottle is emptied.

love how this smells and I feel like it helps keep my hair healthy,1
It smells soooo good; a bit strong tho & has a nice smooth texture,1
I really liked the color of this polish. It was rather opaque without having to apply multiple coats. The one thing I did notice was that it was kind tacky after drying and I did have to run it under a dryer in order for this to go away. Overall a good nail polish.,1
"The lotion itself has good formulation; I personally did not react well to it. When dealing with AHA/BHA exfoliants, make sure to test them out first. Using this and then other AHA containing lotions later on I realized I was reacting badly because my skin does NOT like AHA exfoliants whatsoever. If you know AHA is your thing then I'd say go for it, if not stay away.",0
"I love my Foreo Luna 2!  I too, am a former Clarisonic user that just felt even the sensitive brush was too harsh for my skin.  I hesitated for months before I bought the Luna 2 (price concerns).

They are much improved (I'm 64), so that's a pretty impressive statement.  If you are on the fence, I encourage you to try it.  You will not regret it.",1

I bought this because the combination of bergamot and pear sounded intriguing. It's not. The scent is subtle and indistinguishable as bergamot or pear or anything else for that matter. The lather is almost non-existent. There's nothing interesting or useful about this product.,0
Loved the product but it stopped working after a couple of months... it won't heat up or turn on at all anymore.  Hopefully I just got a bad seed in the bunch because it worked great for the short time it did work.,0
"Overall, I really love the product.  It's easy to use, reasonably priced, definitely a confidence booster.  The only minor issue I have with it is that it gets ""blocky"" and looks like hair plugs after it's been on a while.  I expect this if you're waking up with it in your hair (don't expect it to last overnight), but I noticed it separating into little squares on my scalp after only a few hours, too.  Perhaps if I had gotten the setting product to go with it, it wouldn't do this.  I don't know.

Also, do not apply to wet hair because it gets lumpy and also separates that way.",1

This is the best product for under eye circles.  It covers dark  circles while while being gentle to the eye area.,1
awful and not what I expected at all!  it does not get as hot as the appliances at those dominican salons!  what a waste of money!,0
great 100 % recommended,1
This color is sparkly. I didn't feel that was adequately advertised. After only a few days it appears very faded. Other Zoya colors stay vibrant for weeks.,0
bottle leaked,0
"This product arrived almost empty!! I think it was used or had leaked, not sure!!",0
I love the way my hands feel when I use this product!,1
it's a nice product.,1
"The smell is heavenly and I actually get compliments on how my hair smells! I originally purchased from a high end salon after I loved how it made my hair softer, so I purchased on Amazon when I ran out for about $6 less than the salon price. Love this stuff!",1
"Received the bottle as shown, but the conditioner inside wasn't the same thing.
Had a pine/christmas smell to it. Very strange!
Don't buy!!",0
Was not a good eye cream at all.  I had to use an additional eye cream with it to feel moisturized.,0
I have no idea if the product works or not. I never got that far. There are three steps in the box. You are to mix step one and step two. But step one was missing from the box. It is very unprofessional to be missing parts especially when there are only three. Obviously I am returning it.,0
"I love this stuff!  My skin is often dry and this Obagi product is absolutely the best moisturizer I have ever found.  It melts into your skin without being
""sticky"" or ""gummy"" in any way.  It is beautiful!",1
"Bought with a grain a salt.  Ending up a repeat customer.  Good product. Better than regular % BP.  This is actually working.  Give it 3 weeks before you see dramatic results, but it starts to help dry up breakouts immediately.  Best when use in conjunction with other treatments. Thank  you!",1
"Great products recommended by my new hair stylist.  I love that it is sulfate free.  These products make my hair feel very healthy.  Wonderful savings, quick shipment.",1
"This is a great little curling iron.  I can control the heat, and the size of the barrel gives my longish hair just the right amount of volume.",1
the product was already watched/used when i received it. not happy.,0
Does not dry skin. Leaves skin feeling soft.,1
The unit was the incorrect one. It did not go with the other piece I ordered and I need to return it.,0
My cuticles get really dry in the winter and this is a nice product to use while at my desk. I just wish I didn't have to wash my hands so much because then I have to remember to apply it all over again. I usually apply this cuticle oil and a bit of shea butter creme to my hands and my hands feel amazing.,1
"I really wish I had known this item was not returnable, I wouldn't have paid this much for something new I would have to be stuck with. I've used a lot of spray dry shampoos, but this was my first time trying a powder one, and will probably be my last. It didn't blend, made my (blonde) hair look gray or white, and caused so much build up that I felt like I had to wash my hair sonner rather than later. I did think it smelled nice, so I'm giving it two stars instead of one.",0
"This is the second time I buy the RevitaLash Advanced. It works just as promised, however when I got it this time I was unable to open it, had to use pliers.",1
"This is my first time using this product. I've always been a big fan of Anthony products but this one falls short. I would like to say it's effective but I'm sure. It doesn't lather, so you're never sure it's working or not or if you've used enough.",0
I received this product with an expired expiration date and poor package quality. Very disappointed.,0
I noticed a very unusual effect of this mask on my skin. Everywhere where my hair with the mask touched my skin (my back; shoulder; face) I felt burning. Skin on my face was pink a couple of days after using this mask. I LOVE Rene Furterer products but this mask is weird.,0
This product is not for the sensitive skin. It causes too much burning and face became red after using it for few hours . It might helps your skin but read the ingredient list carefully and if you have sensitive skin then you might want to skip it .,0
Two stars for fast refund but the product itself is not real. I buy this all the time from my local beauty store and this color was completely off by two shades.,0
Bought this product a few months back. it broke the second time I used it !! I was curling my hair and half way through the heating stopped and had not come back since. Light still turns on just no heat!,0
The product was broken st the bottom. Conditioner was all over. Unable to use cause the plastic is broken and sharp,0
quit working just after a year,0
"I am done with Chi products.  I bought some Chi products about six years ago- a hair dryer and a flat iron. They both lasted a long time - but recently I've had to replace them. My hair dresser told me to avoid Chi b/c they've since changed and their products are junk. She is so right. I bought this Chi dryer in July of 2011.  It died within a month and Farouk did fix it- but I had to pay to ship it and pay $15, and I received a new hair dryer. Its been fine until today- it died again. So it lasted about a year. I only use it once a day, so a professional would use it many times per day- likely for her it would die in a month or so! Its past the warranty though so I'm done. I will buy a product my hair dresser recommended instead. Bummer.. that's A LOT of money to be out so fast. I would have been better off buying a cheapie dryer from Target and hoping it lasts a year!",0
"The rod curls your hair fine, but the cord does not auto-spin the opposite direction of your turning of the rod. Consequently, the cord twists into a short tangle. It makes it very difficult to use.",0
"I am a 42 year old female to has fine, wavy, brown hair which is colored blonde, and cut in a bob to just above my shoulders.  I love to see people with shiny hair, as I think that it indicates health and good grooming.  So, I have used many products (including a flat iron) to try to get that shiny look which does not come naturally to fine and color-treated hair.  This is effective, but I don't like to use this every day to possible damage to my hair.  I have used many of the other Lanza shampoo and conditioners (Color Care and the Moisturing line are my favorite), so I thought that I would give it a try.

This product definitely does what it says that it does - it makes your hair smoother.  This means that the hair follicle closes a bit, which results in more shine.  Also, this results in less frizz throughout the day as the humidity doesn't have an open ""door"" to get into the hair and frizz it out like mine always does on hot, humid days.  This shampoo did not have a long lasting effect on my hair, but every day that I used it, it worked well.

It doesn't smell as great as the rest of the Lanza line, but still smells clean.  As with most shampoo and conditioners, it seems to work best with the corresponding smoothing conditioner.  I have not tried to use this without the corresponding conditioner, but they seem to work very well together.

I don't use this daily as I prefer the other product lines which I mentioned from Lanza, but I do use this on super humid days in order to minimize the frizz.  Unless it's super humid that day, I can avoid using my flat iron if I use this product which is great.

I will order this again and keep it around for those humid days but not to use as a daily shampoo (although you certainly could).",1
good overall,0
Works perfectly love this product,1
gift for a young lady - she liked it!,1
Love the Dryer...Power and Heat are Perfect but the Nozzle does Not stay in Place...it either Pops Off or Spins Around and it is Super Annoying :(,0
Bristles are too close together,0
This is crap! Made me break out.,0
The smallest possible sample arrived - with no credit towards future purchases and too too small to determine how good and/or not good it is.,0
"I had read about this product in a magazine and it sounded great! However, upon using the product I found it did not last long on my nails. It began peeling about 2 days after I applied the polish. Very disappointed! I would NOT expect this from such an expensive product.",0
"Because the highlighter is a creamy highlight It is very easy to apply. However, once the cream dries on your skin it leaves a lot of glitter behind and the pretty sheen is gone.. It doesn't stay on the skin actually and it is very thin, oily highlight. Wish it was thicker like the mac ccb",0
"THIS IS A HOT MESS!  I purchased 4 bottles in various colors.  ROCK ROYALTY, BLACK & GREEN COLORS ARE HORRIBLE WATERY AND TOO LIGHT -UNLIKE THE PHOTOS. THE light pink is ok. I contacted the seller to return the unopened bottles that were still sealed in boxes; the vendor WILL NOT accept returns because it is considered a ""personal"" item.  Do not make the same mistake that I did.  I still  have two UNOPENED bottles of this expensive garbage left.  TRASH.",0
"despite that, i used it for a month and did not see any difference",0
"Love this.  It's a little oily at first, but absorbs in quickly.  Really helps my skin feel soft, smooth - especially as a recovery tool if I've spent a bit too much time in the sun.  Reduced to 4 stars only because I think it's a little pricey at regular price.",1
I have used the spray twice now and I am not impressed. I have very long thick hair and when I spray this on my hair I get horrible knots that require me to brush throughout the day. I will not be repurchasing this item.,0
This polish does not go on well or last well after applied.,0
"The product does it's job. Not so much coverage but still it takes away the redness and blocks the sun. This is very handy because I can always reapply over my make-up. Since the compact comes with the mirror and the sponge, you do not need to search for the whole make up bag.
I thought this was a powder but it was a bit creamy (?) but as soon as I applied on my face, it seemed and felt like wearing a powder without drying my skin.",1
"The candle is surprisingly big for the price. The scent is ""spa+ herbs + artificial"". I'm a scented candle fanatic, who generally likes naturally scented products, so it's back to spending $60+.",0
Fantastic makeup I have a scar and it covers it so well,1
Very nice.,1
"Seemed to work well, keeping my eye shadow from creasing despite a full day of wear.  A truer test will be when the weather gets warmer, but no complaints so far!",1
"My daughter's pediatrician recommended this brand of lotions to me for my daughter who has eczema. It made her break out, although we have has success with the face creme made by Mustela. I don't care for the smell. It's a strong floral scent, like a natural one, it makes me think of a field of wild flowers. Or dandelions, I can't decide. If my daughter didn't have such sensitive skin, I might have given this a higher review.",0
"I love the ""Fash Pack"" color.  I've only used it on my toenails so far so i'm really unable to say how it handles everyday wear and tear on the finger nails. But it really is a beautiful color and i look forward to using it again.",1
"I love this hand cream! If feels great when you apply it and it is not greasy. I really appreciate that it has the sunblock in it. I have it in my bag all the time and I apply some when I am driving and the sun is just beating on my hands! A little bit pricey, but it is well worth the money.",1
great product,1
"It heats up good and its a great size for traveling, therefore I am satisfied with this purchase.",1
Love Hot Tools!,1
"I have used this product for years, but when I used the product I bought here, it smelled VERY differently than past bottles.  It didn't have a good smell, and nothing compared to the previous bottles I have used.  Counterfeit product?  I threw it out.  A waste of money.",0
I love love love this product.  It has saved me from wearing a hat all the time.  I didn't give it five stars because I can't apply it without help.,1
"Exercise caution when ordering this product. I have used Rx retinols in the past without issue, but my 60 yr. old face is now an eruption of cystic acne since starting on this cream!!! Must be some other ingredient that can irritate or clog pores. I am sticking with Mario Badescu from now on. Wasted $50.00-wish I could get a refund, but Amazon will only accept new items for return!!!!!!",0
"Very thick, sticky and comes off on clothing.  I should not have purchased it. I would not purchase it again.",0
seems to be working,1
good,1
I think this was an old bottle or something.  It smelled alright for the first couple weeks but shortly after I bought it started to smell sour and made it so I didn't even wanna wear it anymore.,0
"The item that I received was not the correct brush and it was used. The brush was discolored, smelled like soap and several bristled were misshaped.",0
"it's a useful product for our skin care.
i will buy it again from here.
good good good good good",1
"A conflicted review on this one. I LOVE Sebastian hairspray, but this particular one had so many issues spaying! When we could get it to spray, it did the job, but most of the time it came out in thick foam. We would wash the tip and that would sometimes work, but I have never seen this with any other product so was disappointed. I'm sure I received a defect, and that shouldn't take away from Sebastian product itself.",1
"Totally dried out my hair. Need STEAMED rollers. Had to cut 3"" off my hair.",0
This stained one of my lips darker than the other and appeared as though I had drank kool-aid! Quite disappointed as most people saw good results.,0
"it was basically empty when I got it. this is a waste of money, DONT BUY IT!!",0
"Can't figure out just why, but I felt the same product from the salon worked a little better. Also could be that more was demanded of my hands with gardening, etc. during this time of year. Nail Envy does a great job of filling in ridges.",1
"The fact is that concealers are very risky to buy online since color matching with one's own skin tone requires constant trial and error to find just the right shade.  The 60W Brown shade that I received is more orange in color than a natural skin tone.  This was surprising since there is only one shade that is darker, and I am fairly confident that shade is too dark to be a good match.  Outside of the poor color matching, the concealer also is rather greasy when applied, as others have noted.  It looks shiny on the skin, which further calls attention to it.  Another negative is the price, which seems unusually high for a lipstick sized stick of concealer.  It really seems like this should be half the price that it currently retails for.  Overall, this is not worth purchasing given the poor skin tone match and high price.",0
Awesome peach scent that is not too overpowering. I love how soft the cream is and how nicely it lathers up. Cleans my face amazing. Doesnt dry my skin out or make it oily. Clearest my face has been in a while. I use every night and morning or whenever I meed to freshen up. This product has allowed me to not even want to wear makeup. The packaging is very cute as well. Amazing cleanser. I would and I have recommended to friends/family.,1
"I really like this serum.  It doesn't have a strong odor, it goes on smoothly and my skin doesn't feel sticky after use.  The bottle is supposed to last about two months if used as directed...so essentially it will cost you about $50/month to use this product.  While I liked it, any may notice a slight difference, I feel like the before and after should be more dramatic for as pricey as this serum is.  I know beauty and anti aging products can be expensive, but I have to wonder if it's because the ingredients and science behind it warrant the cost, or if it's because they know that people are searching for that fountain of youth that will halt the aging process and pay just about anything to look young.

Overall I would recommend that you try it and see if your results justify the cost.  For me, the jury is still out on whether I will continue the treatment after I've used all that I have.  I like it, but don't like the price.",1
"I am really happy with this concealer.  I found the fair/light shade perfect for my very fair freckled skin.  The concealer does not come with an applicator, is quite thick and creamy, and (in my opinion) smells really nice.

To apply the concealer, I used a smallish makeup brush and then blended it with my finger.  This works really well for small areas, like the dreaded pimple, and larger areas like under the eye or my poor nose, which is always slightly red thanks to too many sunburns as a kid.  The concealer blends easily and looks very natural.  It's pricey, but a little goes a long way so the product should last a good long while.",1
"Using my husband's account:
Not worth the price. Could get the same trype of curls with much cheaper curler. Not as easy to use as it seems to be.",0
I found this too greasy for my fine but curly hair.,0
"Very hard to get used to. I have used this for a couple of weeks now and I'm still trying not to burn myself. It is just a wand without anything to hold your hair. I like the curl that it put in my hair, but my fingers pay the price. It does help to youtube on how to curl with this iron though.",0
I'm a woman of color and I love this. I mean after a few hours it tends to make my deface look dry and pale eh.,1
I really like this sunscreen for both face and body because it goes on super light - not heavy or thick and doesn't leave a bad smell or residue.  It works - dermatological grade sunscreen.,1
"I didn't personally buy this product but i was gifted this from a friend, and i just have a couple of things to say, this eyeshadow palette sucks! It's WAY too expensive for the quality of the product, its super hard to blend and don't tell me i was using the wrong brushes because i saw a ton of tutorials on how to aply this, and it still doesn't blend! the little brush it comes with its the worst its the same quality as a dollar store set of this kind of little brushes, they are super rough! And not to mention the color scheme is terrible, i own the ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"" just in case you wanted to know which one i was talking about. I hope this review helped you in some way. k bye :)",0
"Love this cleanser, perfect for my dry skin!",1
THE PRODUCT ARRIVED DAMAGED. THE BOXED WAS OPENED.,0
Did nothing for me...,0
Great product! Most soothing!,1
"Got it on last November, it only worked couple months, then couldn't recharge anymore.
Made a claim under warranty protection, but need to pay the return shipping fee.
Very unfriendly return policy, even my $20 valued earbuds's warranty covers the replace shipping fee.",0
Nice comb! It serves its purpose well ~ detangles / parts my hair well and I can smack the sh*t out of the kids with it,1
I could see where it was covering. Only needed help applying on my upper back that's just unreachable. Good color only lasted 5 days but not many self tanners are able to last very long. My boyfriend didn't like the smell. I've smelled worse. I used the tan intensifier which smells much better.,1
didn't work for my hair all that well. I have coarse graying hair,0
I guess I got the fake stuff since its now three times the price since the last time I bout it.  Also not as good as I remembered.,0
"It does seem to have more moisture than most ""all day"" lip color. But, it doesn't last as long as that description would indicate. I also wish there were more colors available. Over all, though, a pretty nice ""stain"" that does stay on a little longer than many other lipsticks.",1
Not great for contact wearers. It smudged on the lenses and wouldn't come off.,0
"This product works well for me, I have to use lots of coats to get the look I want..... not sure I would purchase again",1
"I had hopes for this product based on its description of the ""tri-color"" combination, perfecting effect.  Gold, pink, and beige tones all blended in one.  I don't like full coverage foundations, so I thought this might be fun.  In reality, the cream blended in very sheer with lots of sparkle.  It did not perfect anything.  My skin looked exactly the same but with mild sparkles all over.  The pink all blended sheer.  (FYI, in case it helps the reader,  I am a light medium complexion, not fair, but not olive or yellow, I tan easily and when not tanned I normally wear a pinky color type blush).

Since this  blended sheer and looked like I had put nothing on my skin other than a bit of sparkle, I decided to layer it on a few times on my cheeks to see if it would work as a natural looking blush.  It did blush my cheeks, but then it also turned up the sparkle too much for my liking.

Looking at the ingredients, it starts with a few silicones at the top of the list.  So I would consider this to be a simple silicone primer.  Any color or skin perfecting you desire you will still have to accomplish via other methods, ex:  foundation of choice or mineral makeup of choice.

I think I will have to save this for special events, or date nights.  This product could maybe add a nice touch for night-time makeup.  ( the sparkly touch might look nice in low lighting (restaurants, etc) or in pictures (as in: the pigments and sparkles will reflect the camera light and ""hide"" imperfections as far as the picture goes, but not in person).  Assuming you are not covering this product too heavily with other full coverage cosmetics.

I'll use it up, but won't repurchase.",0
Best I've had so far. Definitely more than what I'd usually pay for a deodorant. Smells amazing and subtle. Lasts literally all day.,1
For some reason it's not as creamy and seems different from the one I bought at the store and absolutely loved.,1
"Makes my head itch, no longer using Wen products  Realize now that the shampoo was making my neck and shoulders itch and this makes my head itch as well.  I am now using healthier greener products no more itching and my hair actually even looks better, getting lots of compliments",0
Extremely drying for my babies scalp.,0
I love it!,1
"Big fan of the reuzel product. All grease based product have a great hold without making you feel nasty. In my opinion I prefer the grease based lines as their hold is a little better in comparison to the water based, however the water based products are still very good and wash out easily. Overall great stuff and my go to for hair product.",1
I had to pick between this one and the Armani Code Ultimate and ended up walking away with the new Armani. Then again I just as easily could have bought this one about a week ago. The container is very cool first off and the fragrance is great and lasts a long time. Don't listen to the negative reviews on this. Give it a whirl.,1
"Very nice, easy to apply. Blends easily and cost-effective.",1
Great for what is intended for.,1
I usually love this brand but it floats on top of the skin and you look like you have on way to much on. My daughter tried it and she said the same thing. We both used on of those cute pink make up sponges to apply it as well. Try a different brand.,0
Great product and arrived with the estimated time!,1
Great!,1
This is expensive and doesn't work I've used it twice a day for 3 months no change don't waste your money seriously just buy some Vaseline or coconut oil ...works better and much cheaper,0
Works great,1
good smell but super light. and l mean SUPER light.,0
Have used it for years,1
"I got pimples under my eyes.  True, I have large pores on my skin, so that may be why.  It took 6 weeks for the last one to go away...and I still have a mark.",0
Works really well but could be packaged better. One of my friends commented that it looks like toothpaste and now that's all I see when I look at it!,1
Love it,1
Best Hair gel on the market- If you don't want your hair to move. a little goes a long way and once its there it stays all day.,1
Very pleased with this product. I use it 3x week because it can be somewhat drying to my skin. I use it at night.,1
"***I don't work for Michelle! Since there was a previous complaint about 5 star reviews being her employees***

I can see why some reviews vary from ""highly pigmented"" to ""barely pigmented"".

Here's the thing, Michelle's customer base is 'usually' a younger audience and makeup application is really modest.
For those that find it barely pigmented, what types of products are you using? High end? Do you wear heavy makeup? Or wear your makeup in a very bold manner? I'll admit that I sometimes wear bold, pigmented makeup every now and then, but that's not the palette is made for. Recall, it is ""LIFE PALETTE"" for makeup you wear on the daily.

For those who find it ""very pigmented"", I could only guess that you wear your makeup very modestly or lightly.

Then again, these are just based on the reviews on Amazon and are just guesses based what I am reading.

Understandable that it is pricey for some, but remember that Michelle designed her Life Palettes to be able to remove certain colors onto the travel palette, so its a very custom-made palette.

When buying makeup, keep in mind that there is an extremely wide range of makeup artists and users. Ranging from drugstore products to department store products, or young audience to more mature audience. It's nice to know that Michelle can appeal to many, but note that there is a large variety.",1
"I don't care for the scent (smells a bit like insect repellent), but it's gentle and effective.
UPDATE: Every time I use this on my 2yr old, she gags & coughs a LOT.  Neither of us can stand the strong smell, so it's useless to us regardless of its effectiveness.",0
Not nearly as good as toppik...,0
"I ordered this perfume because of the many reviews that said this smelled light and clean. I received it and couldn't wait to wear it. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in this scent. It smells just like Lemon Pledge. I absolutely cannot wear it bc it smells like a cleaning product. . .and it is so loud and abrasive. I even went to work to try to find someone to pawn this off on and absolutely no one wanted any of it. They would curl their nose in disgust and shrink away from it. I realize perfume is very subjective and I am sure others hate my very favorite perfume (White Gardenia Petals), but I did want to offer an alternate view.",0
"I like the way this shampoo smells and it does not dry my hair out.  It is a good shampoo.  I don't use it daily, but it seems to be the best shampoo to use after putting lots of product in my hair.  Seems to get it all out and smells good.",1
"Wet dog, that's the lingering odor, and let me tell you, it ain't pleasant first thing in the morning!  I got this product through the L'occitane website during their holiday gift box deals, and had high hopes for it as I love their almond hand cream.  But, this lathers nicely and smells like almonds out of the bottle...as soon as you lather it up, though, it turns into the most awful wet dog smell.

Three bottles of this stuff are now in my garbage...pity, because their products are not cheap.",0
"Love this dryer! It's pretty quiet and dries my hair quickly. It's a bit heavy, but that's true of most good quality hair dryers.",1
smells great!! works well,1
"I really love the smell of the scent from the bottle...or on a spray card. I thought it would be 'my' fragrance. I still like the scent but it doesn't last more than 30 minutes on me! I don't know if the spray would be any different, but I will not buy the roll-on again.",0
"Gave this product a try after I ran low on my bar of shaving soap. I switched to a safety razor many months ago and have successfully been able to shave without the irritation and breakouts I was getting with multi-blade disposable razors.

I thought this stuff would be better than shaving soap because of its consistency, but it has a single point of failure. It ""loads up"" under the blade of safety razors. It's difficult to get a clean shave when the razor can't stay clean of shaving cream and facial hair. This stuff is very thick and it clings to the blade, making it inconvenient to have to take out the blade and rinse it off every few shaving strokes.

Maybe it works better with disposable multi-blades, maybe not, but I don't recommend it for safety razors.",0
"Love being able to adjust the heat so I'm not constantly ""frying"" my hair and causing it to frizz more than it naturally does!  I also appreciate the fact that the end has a protector on it so I can hold it if need be as I am curling and don't get burned.  I've been using this curling iron for six months now and really like it!",1
Professional Stylist Review . Do Not buy this brand . I was trimming a guys mustache and they went Pop and died. Just over about 6 months use. Thank God it did not hurt the man!!! Not worth a dime u pay.,0
"Lasts a long time. Great for refilling a mister for spraying brushes, or for using with water in a spinbrush. Has a very nice clean smell to it as well.",1
"Smells alot like the colonel, but also smells very clean. Love it! Dont see myself getting tired of anytime soon.",1
"It is a tad strong....kinda like it smells old.  BUT, once he has it on for a bit, it softens and isn't half bad",1
"I was worried when I received the bottle that the color would be too dark - based on the outside of the bottle.  But once applied, it went on nicely and the tone was right for my skin (no watermark line at the chin).  A little goes a long way and it didn't feel oily or thick once applied.  I typically use loose powder with my foundation and the powder adhered nicely to it, giving that matte finish I seek.  Of note is that it was very yellow on my skin - not a golden yellow but a sallow yellow.  I had to add powder to knock back the yellow.",1
Its the only mist that works well for my baby-fine hair & smells really good.  I wash my hair & while it's wet spray my hair with the mist & then blow dry & style it.,1
I love this conditioner.  My hair feels so clean after using it.  It's not heavy like most conditioners and has a delightful clean scent.  A must have !,1
I've been using this light cover up for years. It does a great job. Covers the red spots and evens out my complexion. Love it.,1
"I did not care for this product, it did nothing for my skin.",0
"If could give zero stars I would.  DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY!  I tried this on every possible area: underarms, bikini, legs - it did absolutely NOTHING.  I was very very careful to follow the directions and I gave it at least 8 treatments, correctly spaced apart, on each area.  There has be NO reduction of hair growth.  Total rip off.  Despite what the packaging said about pain levels I felt nothing using this thing. I've had laser hair removal done in a salon since buying this and it bites!  With this product I felt absolutely nothing.  Major rip off.",0
"Too much hype, not enough result. The nose pack was very sticky, but did not peel off nicely. It left a lot of residue on nose, and it didn't even remove much blackheads.",0
"I have purchased Teamine Eye Complex before from my physician's office. The jar had a black lid.  When I was comparing the two Teamine Eye Complex producs offered by Amazon, the containers looked the same.  All the info was the same that I could determine. So - I bought the cheaper one.  When it came, the packaging was similar, but the jar had a silver lid instead of the black one which is on the more expensive product.  The silver lid was not displayed on the less expensive product on Amazon.  A silver lid on the less expensive product would have indicated to me that the products were not exactly the same.

So - now I question if what I ordered is a knock off of the real Teamine Eye Complex?",0
Stays tacky even after 9-12 minutes under the light,0
"I have used this product in the past and love the light coverage it gives you.  It's great in the summer when you want some coverage but not too  much,",1
"I liked this cream, it was great, not sure i would order again, but will keep in mind, will recommend to my family and friends",1
"This is your basic shaving cream. It whips up very easily in a mug or on your brush. When you rinse with cold water, you definitely feel the menthol come through, as it's very cool and refreshing.

I use a variety of shave products, and this is a great go-to daily-use cream, as it's definitely on-par with many more expensive products out there.

Lastly, if you rinse with water after shaving with this, you can feel free to put on any scent aftershave you want, as the menthol doesn't linger, which is nice, IMO.",1
"My sister recommended Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, so I decided to give it a try. One very big positive is the price. In my experience, many skin care products are scams that can cost a fortune. 17.00 is a fair price for this product. The lotion (thought it's not really a lotion) contains salicylic acid and chamomile. Most people probably know that salicylic acid is a very common and inexpensive product used to treat acne, which can also reduce redness. Chamomile is also used to reduce redness, so the formula of combining the two seems like a good idea.

The directions are simple. Apply your usual nighttime moisturizer before applying the drying lotion. Make sure you allow your moisturizer to dry thoroughly before applying the drying lotion. Then, dip a qutip in the bottle of drying lotion, and apply it to problem areas on your face. Make sure to buy extra long qutips because regular qutips barely reach the bottom of the bottle. Once you have used about half of the product, you are going to want an extra long qutip.

Now, how effective is this product? I think it is just as effective as something like Proactiv. The drying lotion is not a miracle by any means. Does it work? Yes, it works to some extent. It works to the extent that salicylic acid has always worked. Will you have dramatically clearer skin overnight? No. Will you have clearer skin after a few days? Yes. But this product is not a miracle or a new formulation that we have never seen before, and this product does not prevent acne. Many of the reviews fail to mention that this product is actually intended for use on whiteheads. I rarely have whiteheads, so I mainly used the drying lotion on your average red pimples. So I can say that the product does work on average pimples to an extent, but it's no better than Proactive, Retin-A, or anything else you might have tried. I tried the drying lotion on a few whiteheads, and, again, it's not a miracle worker. It works as effectively as most other products I have tried.

I will buy this product again for two reasons: the price is fair, and I do not want to pay a dermatologist to prescribe me benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. The dying lotion is a good product, but it's not a miracle. Set your expectations reasonably, and you should be fine.",1
"I have gotten this item from beauty stores as well as through amazon before and have never had this problem. Maybe this was an individually defective item, however, from the time I opened it, it's been very dry. It is hard to apply as the felt tip is barely saturated with any of the actual liner. Used it for about a week, hoping it would eventually get darker and that maybe it took some time for it to work and at that point, didn't feel it would be appropriate to return. Very disappointing and I hope this was an isolated indecent.",0
"I'm sure the product it great but I'll never find out since I can't get the jar open. This was packaged so poorly that the liquid escaped the jar and made a huge mess. Luckily, it was wrapped in plastic and I noticed the mess before tearing open the plastic. Finally, getting really brave I got the slippery jar out of the plastic by holding it over a sink so it couldn't leak onto anything else. Done. I did it! Great. But, now, the jar is still so slippery and only 2/3rd full, and I can't get the damn lid off. Frustrated? ME?? You bet!
Buy this product, because I have used it and like it, but Do Not buy it through Amazon!!!",0
Plastique doesn't add volume to my hair.,0
"The product itself is GREAT... once it comes out of the can. I am not sure if I got a defective product, but I have to push so hard on the top to get the texturizing spray to come out. Because I am pushing so hard, the product comes out so fast and does not allow for even application. I am very disappointed in the quality of the spray can for a product that is this expensive.",0
"Can't use it after purchasing the Silk'n Flash&Go and it quit working after 3 months so now I also purchased an upgrade kit and can't use it.

BE CAREFUL ABOUT purchasing the Flash&Go and this product from Amazon as the product(s) are not covered under the actual product warranty!  Purchase the produce directly from Silk'n Flash&Go website.  Three (3) months of using the Fash&Go it quit working.  I am out $179 plus the purchase of this product upgrade because I can't get my product fixed!",0
"Nice scent, but expensive.",1
"I was really hesitant to buy this nail polish, at $[...] I was not about to try this out. For two months I wore nail polish and it left me with weak, brittle nails and no matter what I tried I could not get them back to their pre-polish condition. I tried almost every other nail companies cheapo nail strengthener, including half the sally hansen line.

After being frustrated, I finally broke down and bought this. For the first week, I saw ZERO change, my nails seemed to chip even more. I followed the directions of applying once a day for a week, then removing. I'm on my third week now and I am finally seeing results. My nails are growing quickly, and much stronger. The nails don't bend or chip easily. Its a great product, and actually delivers what it promises.",1
I bought this product as the active ingredients were the same as Eminence Organic's Williow Bark Serum which is $58/bottle. This product did absolutely nothing for my skin. I have acne prone/oily skin. I thought this product was going to help with the breakouts and or skin discoloration from acne scarring but it did neither. I applied multiple times a day and combined with my daily moisturizer and still nothing. I would not recommend this product nor will I buy it again.,0
OMG!!!!! .09 oz. it's a joke for $8.00. It's like the size of a free sample.  Total waste of $8.00.,0
I have fine curly hair. This is the only Klorane formula that gives me volume and enhances my curls. It's my one pricey shampoo that I buy and I love. Also use matching leave in conditioner.,1
For the price not worth it. Go to your local drug store,0
best cleanser!  great for acne prone skin.,1
This works so well but it flakes :(. It's too expensive to flake. Not living up to it's claims.,0
Excellent my wife loved it,1
Love how smooth my face is,1
What else could I say?? It hurt!! The Swissco is far superior.,0
"Uhm smell is okay but the previous Pomade that I use from American Crew is much better, Just trying something new.",1
"This does not smell like the Lafco candles I own at all. In fact it smells kind of ""off"" not sure if I got an old one or that's just how it is. I have 4 Lafco candles in my home and will stick with them. This was over-priced and not effective or great. Would not recommend.",0
Very disappointed with PCA products in general. Dried my skin out completely in 3 days! My face was peeling and red. I don't recommend PCA products at all. Very disappointed and not satisfied.,0
"Love Love Love it,,,,,will buy again",1
Love it!,1
"My daughter had no reaction because she's older and her eczema isn't an open wound, but after reading the ingredients list which is on the mustela website and not the packaging I wouldn't have purchased it. The product is mostly preservatives and alcohols plus one distillated oil. I don't doubt the one star reviews regarding burning on open wounds. Skip this and try metaderm organic for eczema or psoriasis.  I wouldn't put this on an aggravated rash if they paid me.",0
"After reading good reviews I decided to buy this for my Husband. He used it and said it was ""ok""
. My sister remarked it smelled like Ben gay for old folks. I think for 15.00 it is over rated. It is a bar of soap guys. No pain relief whatsoever although it is labeled as pain relieving.",0
"This conditioner in general works ok in terms keeping my hair smooth and giving them a nice shine.

The problem is that it takes A LOT to lather it all over my hair and achieve the desired effect. Ie. I had to use almost double the amount I'd normally use from other salon-grade conditioner. Given that it's already significantly more expensive than most other salon-grade conditioner, it just makes this conditioner way far less affordable when it doesn't necessarily perform better.

Will not buy again.",0
to heavy,0
I love this lotion. I have been using it on my infant since birth.,1
"Love this color, everybody comments on it!",1
"I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing.  This mascara is pointless, it does nothing. It also flakes off.",0
"I've loved Kneipp products all of my life and this is a nice assortment of scents.  They've combined the old scents with some of the newer ones in a cute little package.  However, the bottles tend to stick to the bottom of the package and are sometimes difficult to remove and replace.  However, this is a minor hassle because the product itself is really good!

I especially love the Eucalyptus, which when experiencing allergies, is great at clearing your sinuses!",1
"This is a very high-end set of grooming equipment that would be suitable for a gift. It comes beautifully packaged in a sturdy attractive box and a leather case. The stainless steel tools are as beautiful as such things can possibly be.

The clippers are unique because they lay flat (nice!) and have to be ""engaged"" properly to cut. These clippers are sharp and will work well for a gentleman's fingernails. They are probably too dainty for his toenails, though, unless he is especially pampered... which maybe he is if he's buying, or being given, a set of ultra expensive nail clippers....

The scissors are especially well-engineered. They are comfortable and cut smoothly. The file is a nice weight.

I doubt that these items work ten times better than a drugstore set that costs a tenth of the price, but they are handsome and I expect them to last a very long time.",1
"Great scent, and it lathers quickly.

works as expected and described.  I was surprised how different my hair looked when i used this.,1
Complete waste of money.,0
"Not as good as I had hoped that it would be and it smudges too easily. If you like more of a charcoal grey liner, this one may be right for you. I prefer mine black so I was disappointed in the colour.",0
"did not work for me, but maybe for someone else",0
Hello! I got this iron because I needed a thicker curling iron. It gets HOT so its great for hard to manage hair. It makes nice bigger sized curls as well. The only drawback is that this iron leaves clamp marks on just about every piece. I am pretty good with hair styling tools and no matter what I did I always had clamp marks from this iron. Wish it didn't because it works well otherwise!,1
"Returned this unit.  It did not heat up enough to give me lasting curls.  Curls were gone within the hour.  I have used other units in the past with better results.  The good news is that the curlers were very easy to use and the clips held my hair very well with no crimping.  I wanted to love this, but it just did not accomplish its intended purpose.  I will go back to my trusty air brush and curling iron.  It gives better results in less time.",0
"Excellent product! Cleared up my acne within 2 weeks. You must use daily to get the best results.
Big drawback... Overpriced",1
"I found a suggestion for this product from a blog talking about ways in which the blogger cleared up her skin. It did help clear up my face but after a week of using the product it seems to dry up my skin. So I think it's a product that I can only use periodically. I'll use it when I'm have pimple issues. But in defense, this is a body wash.",1
best sunscreen by far,1
"Lorac pro matte is the best. The perfect compromise between the long term stay of a lip stain, but the smooth matte application of a creamy lipstick. Plus it smells like brown sugar. I have 5 shades and I want more. This wine shade is fabulous. Its my third tube in the last two years.",1
"i have this concealer palette in light and i can literally use it all year long. i love how i can customize my shade in the little mixing well. i like to use the peach neutralizer to cancel the blue tones under my eyes and then blend my main shade on top. also would be great for girls that want to try the highlight and contour trend!

i'm an em-ployee",1
nice,1
One of the better moisturizers I'ved used. I feel like my skin drinks it up. I have combination skin and I use two-ish pumps after I get out of the shower and my forehead feels tight enough after I get dressed that I use a little more but it's winter. Smells like basic hand lotion but that fades pretty quickly. My makeup goes on smoothly and my face doesn't feel greasy at all--I definitely think my face has broken out less since using it. Summer will be the real test though!,1
Love this fragrance.,1
This product is horrible. I put in on painstakingly and even but it dries streaky and blotchy. The only way to get is off seems to be over time. I have using bronzing mousse before and never had this problem. I will not waste my money on this product again.,0
But hope to when I receive it,0
Clear skin didn't do much for my skin unfortunately. It caused my skin to become dry and break out more.,0
"It was not heavy, but heavy enough. Lightweight compared to the old one. It did smell like vinyl for a few days.  I hope it really is mold resistant.",1
"I found this sunscreen to be a bit too greasy looking on my face. If you used just a tiny tiny amount, it might not be so bad, but then I would worry about having enough on for adequate sunscreen. My face looked wet after using it. I was disappointed since it had so many good ratings. But everyone is different...",0
"I picked it up thinking it was a purple shade however once i got home and applied over a baby pink nail polish; the color seemed very red. Also, if you really want extra glittery nails; I'd recommend just putting a glitter coat over as this is not glittery enough on its own.

meh. i'm returning this.

the quality of the nail polish (this is my first OPI purchase) is good and the brush is long enough for a smooth apply.",0
"I'm almost finished the whole tube and I have seen no difference at all. I've used it twice a day, I've used it once a day. I've used it on my eyelids, under my eyes, to the sides, on other areas of fine lines - no change. Was worth the try but I'm going back to coconut oil.",0
"The smell of this perfume is so pretty. Soft, clean, and subtle. Definitely an attention grabber. Can't begin to count the number of compliments I've received when wearing this. Taking a star off only because the perfume seems to come out in somewhat of a jet stream instead of a mist when you spray it. Otherwise, great product.",1
"I was recommended this oil from my hairdresser over a year ago and I fell in love. I have very dry, medium length, curly hair and chemically straighten it every 3 months, and process it with heat about once a week. I apply this oil in the morning after styling and at night before I go to bed to keep my ends moisturized and provide protection against my ends splitting. Unlike other oils that I occasionally use, this one does not leave my hair greasy and or heavy feeling. I get the smooth consistent curls or sleek straight hair without feeling or looking like I have a ton of product in my hair. Each bottle last me about 3 months. I can't rave about this oil enough!",1
"This does work to remove make-up. I wasn't sure about the sellers claim what the product does, but yes it DOES remove make-up, and removes it well !",0
"Had my nails done 2 weeks ago and as of now just needed to remove one of the shellac's on one nail and fix it, it was very easy to do, maybe next will be doing all of my nails.",1
"This is a glossy black, just the ticket.",1
Works well. Straightener does get hot on the plastic ends.,1
"I really like this curling iron. It heats fast with more then enough heat settings and gives me long lasting curl without a lot of hair product. I have very short hair the  size is perfect for my hair.
The only problem with this curling iron is the placement of the off on switch. I'm left handed and I keep shutting it off while I'm curling my hair. Not sure if being left handed has anything to do with it or not. I would recommend this curling iron to anyone who wants long lasting curl for a great price.",1
"After lengthy use, found that my skin felt dry and couldn't wait to wash it off. Lip gloss felt good at first. Then skin on lips peeled and dried my lips.  Sorry to say am disappointed after paying so much.",0
My daughter loves it.,1
Not impressed. Oily and no better than using cheap shaving cream. Will not buy again,0
The smell is very very light...my daughter said that it smell like a woman cologne,0
Thefilecame unglued from the case very disappointed for what it cost me,0
"After much research on the internet, and reading some positive reviews, I was very excited to try this product.  Well, it didn't work for me.  I used the highest setting for four to five treatments and noticed absolutely no change.  I called the company to verify I was using the product properly and I was. Since I was approaching the refund time frame, I was getting concerned I was wasting my money on a product that does not work.  So, I contacted the company and after several phone calls/emails they finally gave me an RMA to send to send it back for a return.  (It was still in the time frame for returns and I had all of the packaging it came with, so I was still eligible for a return.)  Three weeks later, they still have not refunded me.  First they tried to tell me that my package never arrived, but fortunately I had a delivery confirmation to prove that it did.  So they found it and said my refund was being issued that day, a week later, no refund. My emails and messages I left for the company were never responded to.  Finally I got them on the phone and again, they say they can't find my information.  I'm now waiting for another call back.  I will certainly update this when I do receive my refund, but the whole process is very frustrating and since the refund is taking so long now seems shady.....but regarding the product, if it sounds too good to be true it probably is!  I didn't notice any changes and I fit the proper profile.  Also, be please be very, very careful with your eyes, the light will go off without a good seal on your skin - even thought the packaging suggests it wont.",0
"I have spent years looking for the perfect products without silicones (hair, body, make up) but they generally cost more. So I took my stylists advice to try this line since they cost a tiny bit less and she claimed would work well for me. Left my hair a silicone coated frizzy greasy mess that my straightener cant fix. Meanwhile I swapped one day for my old product and my hair looks great today. I find with hair products it helps to mix it up and rotate products but this will go to my emergency, Im out and cant get anything in time and need a one time use stash.",0
Love this scent!  I receive so many compliments when I wear it!,1
Great stuff,1
I love it !,1
I was so excited to see Essie nail polish on amazon.... I thought I was ordering this barely purplish more reddish wine color as seen in the product pictures but it arrived as an undesired purple. I can't return it so I wasted $9 on this color that I will never wear. I want my money back. I always rave about Essie nail polish but this was a disappointment just because the photos aren't accurate. I guess I have to buy it in store from now on to be sure of the color.,0
"No fresh smell like my original purchase. It has an odor like it might be out of date, but no date on it.",0
Good,1
This isn't good for anyone expecting coverage.,0
"Great product. EltaMD's official website states that Amazon is an authorized seller of their product. Thank goodness! There's only one place in my town that sells EltaMD and they're always out of stock. Buying this product on Amazon gives me peace of mind (that it's not a fake) and it's convenient. My skin was feeling dry and this is a great pick me up. I use it at night. It can feel oily at first, but make sure you follow the directions. After it sits for a couple minutes, you need to pat it into your skin. Your finger tips will absorb/ wipe off the excess product in the process. This product is basically petroleum. It's not like a cream, FYI.",1
"Unfortunately this product came to me completely broken and I had to return :( I love lorac shadows because they are super soft, buttery and pigmented but I think in this case the shadows are too delicate for shipping.",0
This soap stinks (literally).,0
I was really hoping to like this cream. I have oily/combo skin and have to be extra careful what I use. I used a tiny amount right after a shower before bedtime and it felt very thick. Seems like it sat on the skin and didn't absorb. I woke up with my face feeling like it was caked in grease. I am going back to my old stuff.,0
THE BEST CONDITIONER I'VE EVER USED. WILL CONTINUE TO BUY AND USE THIS PRODUCT. PHILLIP B IS A GENIUS.,1
"I noticed a big difference in my skin the first time  I used it. The smell is different, but I love knowing that it's not harming my skin with harsh chemicals. I can't wait to try other products from them. Oh, and I love the bottle it comes in.",1
great tool worth the price,1
"It does leave less residue than most.  Also weaker hold, but that's fine if you're looking for a lighter spray in every way.",1
"Dermablend Intense Powder Camo is an excellent product. Easy to apply and provides exactly the right amount of coverage you desire. I apply a light layer and find that it hides the dark areas under my eyes and even the red remainder of an unexpected zit. IIt also provided a nice matte finish that I completed with my powder blush and I was set. It comes in a nice compact with a sponge in a separate compartment and the finish may be customized too. If you want a dewy finish, pat your skin gently with a wet sponge after applying the powder to your face. I have very delicate skin and do not need heavy cakey makeup. This Dermablend fills all my requirements and is made in the USA.",1
"The powder is fine, but I advise strongly against using the included powder puff.

The fibers of the puff shed quite a bit, and before I started using a makeup brush I had problems with the fibers getting in my eyes (not a good thing when you have contacts in your eyes).",1
This is a replacement for an iron didn't work and the replacement didn't heat up either. I am giving the transaction 1 star because of the on time shipping. I'm not satisfied and I still need this item!,0
My hair is really straight and has never held curl.  This iron is AMAZING!! my hair holds cute corkscrew curls all day long with barely any hairspray.  The cord swivels so it's easy to use and it heats up fast.  I would definitely recommend this iron to anyone.,1

"I bought this product based on reccomendations from a writer/blogger that has severe excessive under arm sweating issues, not unlike myself; I have purchased several products in the hopes that one or a combination of a few would stop the embaressing sweating! Long story short, I received the DERMA DOCTOR product, used it and it had ZERO effectiveness in reducing my under arm perspiration. Only AFTER using it for a week did I decide to read the back and discovered it's active ingredient is EXACTLY the same ingredient as the clinical strength Secret solid I already have, not only that but my SECRET clinical strength antiperspirant has 19% as where the Derma Doctor only has 11.25%! In addition, the SECRET clinical strength only cost me $7.00 dollars and the Derma Doctor was $20.00! Neither antiperspirant works for me but if you want to try an antiperspirant with this active ingredient to see if it may help for you buy the secret clinical strength at your local store and save yourself the $13.00 dollars difference in price!",0
"This product arrived unsealed.  Looked as if it had been used.  I contacted the seller: Authentic Skin Care.  They would not respond until I contacted Amazon customer service to complain.  I had a bad reaction to the product and Authentic Skin Care refused to stand behind the product.  I also indicated that I had received this item unsealed.  Authentic Skin Care finally relented and said I could return the item at my expense and they would charge me a restocking fee.  Authentic Skin Care made this experience a huge disappointment.  Many of my friends purchase on Amazon, so I decided to give it a try.  I doubt I will be making future purchases on Amazon.  It apparently is a huge risk to purchase items on Amazon",0

My hair frizzes extremely fast but I have a feeling this dryer may turn that around with time.  I barely need to use styling tools at all except to put a few finishing touches in after my blowout.  I've never bought a fancy dryer before but even if this breaks in 6 months, I'd buy it all over again.",1

I wasn't able to use this long enough to see if it works as described. After a couple of days I noticed that the skin around my eyes was darker than usual and then my eyes started to feel tired and irritated. I'm disappointed that my eyes are too sensitive for this product. So sad!!,0
goes with red and pink,1
Works great for filling in thin area.,1
Love this iron......only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because I had to get a second one after about 1 year....the old one kept turning off.  The price is great and it is just as good as a CHI and I have tried them all.  Highly recommend this product.,1
I ordered this and the nozzle does not work. Then I find out this item is not eligible for return. Never again !!!,0
"Koh Gen Do Pure Cotton - 60 Pads
Sold by: b-glowing

Well, it seems only us vapers are reviewing this stuff. I agree, it is far better than any of the cotton balls I tried. Very easy to trim to size with predictable consistency for any given coil, and super easy to insert into a coil. Wicking is fantastic with no ""break-in"" required.

I know it's been found on other sites for a little bit less money, but only Amazon had it when I wanted it. And it's a VERY large amount of cotton for our uses.

I have since moved on to cellucotton rayon for its durability (can take a dry hit better), but that doesn't remove the fact that this is excellent cotton for wicking the atomizers we use on personal vaporizers.",1

"I purchased this product about 2 weeks ago and noticed it was 135.00 verses the regular price of 185.00 and I guess that should have told me , too good to be true.

This is the second time I have bought Perricone products via Amazon's sellers verses through actual Perricone sellers. (authorized sellers). BOTH times Ive felt I have thrown away my money.

I will NEVER buy any Perricone products this way again.

I have purchased direct from Perricone and also from authorized resellers and have not been so dissapointed as I have the two times Ive bought through Amazon.

This product came, unsealed (which Perricone does NOT seal their products, which means anyone can add water to them) maybe that is why it was so much less expensive? Dont know but the Deep Wrinkle Serum I bought here has the consistency of water, and I have not noticed ANY difference even though it states immediate results...

I will never risk my money here again on Perricone, instead I will buy direct from Perricone. They have some good specials from time to time.",0

My only complaint with this product is that all the colors aren't creamy and pigmented. Some are. But the colors are pretty powdery and dry. I also would have to say the lip colors in the pallete are a cool concept, but they become very dulled when you use the powders. Overall though I would recommend this product to all my friends and it's a great buy.",1
I only ever tried the express top coat before.  I decided I'd try this and was very happy with it.  My nails are strong and shiny even after 6 days.,1

Definitely not gonna order from this seller again. I ordered two tubes of lighter than light. Nd when they reached me they were actually shade light/medium with a fake sticker attached on top that said lighter than light whch isliterally 2 shades darker than what i ordered and hence its useless for me. Highly disappointed! Wont recommend this seller to anyone! Would give it no stars if i could!,0

"I received this product in the monthly Birch Box samples that I subscribe to.  As I am getting, older my hair is really changing - way more friz than I used to have.  So when I got this product I was happy to give it a try.  I have short, thinish hair and the product really worked well in controlling the frizz and giving more body to my fine hair.  Although, after a hot August day of sweating, some of the frizz came back around the frame of my face and the nape of my neck.  Overall, I was happy with the product and willing to pay $28.00 to get a full size product. Hope this helps!

"Didn't buy this again
instead Im using (Fresh Rose) check it out at sephora
which is a mush better product that is not so expensive",0
"If you are looking for a polish to remove nail polish with glitter, this remover is a great option. I was wasting tons of nail polish remover on my glittery nails so I decided to look for a better product to remove it with. Although it does not remove the glitter immediately, (you do need to apply a bit of pressure and rub) it does come off fairly well. It is a quick way to get glitter nail polish off without wasting a ton of product. I only use one cotton ball with the remover for each hand. For regular polish, I only need one cotton ball for both. I change my nail polish frequently (about once a week) and I still have the same bottle for over a month. I also use OPI nail polish on my nails. I haven't tested it with other brands.",1
Sadly lacks solid power for carrying the Hot Tools brand name. Not worth the purchase for people looking for a dryer needed for long or styled hair. Fine for kids however.,0
Great curling iron. Heats up fast and it's a good size barrel. Good for everyday waves. Haven't had any issues with it.,1
"This product is amazing however, it took three weeks to arrive from the seller.",0
I hated it.  Does a poor job in cleaning your teeth.  Ineffective.,0
Did work for me at all. Pretty disappointed.,0
Can't tell that it makes an improvement after months of use.,0
Love it!,1
Not good,0
"I'm not a chemist, and have no idea what is in this stuff.  i do not have many wrinkles, and the ones I do are very fine (around eyes and across fore head).  I don't see much of a difference after using this for a week around my eyes, but I can say, it did seem to be working on the fine lines on my forehead, and I did see an actual difference immediately.  I will report back and add to my review after I've used it after 4 weeks.

It smells absolutely great, by the way, and it seems to be a very fine, light moisturizer.",1
"So I love essie and the color was rich and beautiful, though the picture is not really what it looks like in person. The color is more of a pink, then light coral. It took almost three weeks to be delivered.",1
Very shiny,0
"Not happy

I like the actual product but it was broken so before you toss away the packet make sure you review your product",0
The face loos great but the color wears off easily when you touch your face! To me this is a big fail in a product.,0

"As recommended by Amazon, I purchased this diffuser when I purchased the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/T3-Featherweight-Luxe-2i-Ion-Generator-Hair-Dryer/dp/B008N3HXTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">T3 Featherweight Luxe 2i Ion Generator Hair Dryer</a>. When purchasing the hair dryer, this item was (and as of 9/24/2013 is still) listed under ""Frequently Bought Together"" with the T3 Featherweight Luxe 2i Ion Generator Hair Dryer.  Contrary to their claim, the T3 SoftTouch Diffuser for Featherweight Dryers (#73807) does NOT fit my new T3 Featherweight Dryer.

I'm returning the diffuser today, and I will do more research before selecting the appropriate diffuser attachment.  This was the first time I've ever had an issue when purchasing something using the ""Frequently Bought Together"" tool.  I guess I will need to be more careful in the future.",0
"I actually really like this lipstick. The color is beautiful, and it really is a comfortable matte lipstick (where it's matte but not weird and creasing on your lips). Highly moisturizing! I took away one star just because I ordered the color toff, which I looked up on multiple websites to make sure it was described similarly as it was on amazon. Online, it looks a bit deeper, cooler toned with a hint of mauve or something similar. It looks a bit more pinky on the skin with a very subtle mauve undertone. Still pretty though! It also has just the slightest, finest, barely noticeable gritty texture to it that almost makes me feel like I'm doing the gentlest lip exfoliation ever. Don't mind it, though, because after a minute, it fades.
-EDIT-
I should mention that, whether mine was a dud or not, the finish on these lipsticks look less nice after time. I'm disappointed that I liked everything else about this lipstick, but once it set (and I was even happy that it set and transferred very little!), it looked very dry and a bit patchy. For a $22 product, that was just silly.",0
This product promises many things but doesn't work to my back acne,0
Gorgeous color!,1
"Very pretty, subtle color.  Goes on easy enough with a scent that I didn't care for at first but diminishes quickly.  I didn't notice any real enhancement or increase in fullness of my lips and didn't care for the feel of the gloss after applying it.  I kept rubbing my lips together because I could still feel the gloss on it.  Not crazy about that.  I want to put the gloss on and forget about it.",0
"This is a nice fragrance lotion to put on before going out to a party or dinner.  I have very dry skin, and  use lotions for that issue, but this is not one I would use for that purpose.  Josie should be used primarily for fragrance, not to help with dry skin.  It's a thinner product than I'm used to using, but it went on nicely and soaked right in.  The scent is strong and lasted quite some time. I got many compliments throughout the evening.",1
I feel like after using this product my hair got super dry. Has anyone else felt like this.,0
"This highlighter is extremely pigmented and will definitely show up on your face. I have a few other subtle highlighters, so I really wanted one that will make a statement. The highlight is not glittery and the glow is intense but still natural.",1
I bought this for my husband because he hates shaving with regular shaving cream. He loves shaving the old fashion way with a shaving brush and this type of soap. He says finally doesn't mind shaving again. He loves this soap and the small. Finally he shaves normally again.,1
"After reading so many glowing reviews, I was excited to try this newer formulation of Proraso, only to be quite disappointed by it.

Pros:
  Good lather and a fairly lubricating shave.

Cons:
  Too firm---a bit waxy.  Falls off the brush and is a little difficult to start lathering.
  Fragrance: cheap white soap.  Clean & fresh,  but very uninteresting.  A bit of an off-smell, which the red formula has, too.
  No more ""protective"" or moisturizing than the other Proraso formulas.
  Just not as rich, lubricating & easy to use as the very original formula.

Having tried this and the red & newer green formulas, I am bidding the Proraso brand good-bye.  I may use the ""White"" soap in winter.

However, I still love C.O.Bigelow in the green tube, which is made by Proraso.  It is still creamy, incredibly easy to lather, rich, lubricating and soothing.  Fantastic cream, compared to this.  Menthol/Eucalyptus might not be for everyone, but I do enjoy it much more than these Proraso alternatives.

Possibly I got a bad lot, but I surely have far more enjoyable creams than this one.",0
"This is new, unopened and I wanted to return it when I found out it was to treat acne, which I don't have.  Website says I can not return.  Can you help?
Judie Glenn",0
When I put this my skin hurt because something like sand is in it.and too thick.,0
It's pretty bad. Stays moist and ends up all over your face after. Their previous range was much better.,0
Just plain does not work. Makes the pimple actually larger. Don't waste the money on this pointless product please.  If only there were refunds.,0
"Very poorly designed. The peg that holds the brush head to the base BROKE OFF. A useless, overpriced device. The customer service is as worthless as the defective, over-priced garbage toothbrush. Save your money & buy something else!",0
This product along with the conditioner is awful. I have used it 3 times now just to be sure I could write a fair review. Hair feel dry and greasy. Plus the smell is not pleasant. Would not recommend.,0
"I absolutely LOVE L'anza hairspray and just happened upon this product while searching. I have very thin hair due to health issues and was excited to try something new that wasn't a gel or mousse, which both tend to weigh my hair down. Sadly, I could only tell a very small difference in the amount of lift and volume from my roots. Won't be buying again.",0
"This stuff works great, just done overdo it. Easy does it...
Also, works best on people with thin hair but still a decent amount of hair. If you have actual bald spots, putting on them might be noticeable to others.",1
I really love this product. It is such a great detangler for my hip length hair.,1
Great product!,1
I am buying it again. I liked the smell.,1
"At first I didn't like this product. I followed the instructions but I think I do have more hair than who this product is intended for. Some would say I have a full head of hair but it is receding and I can see my scalp on the sides and in the center on top so I hought it was for me.
I don't know if is actually making my hair grow but I do like what it does with my hair once I learned how to use it.
I follow the instructions and once my hair is dry and use my fingers to break the product up as it seems to work as hair spray or a hard gel once dry. So after breaking up the crunchiness my hair is much thicker and has a great shine. So I like it. Still not sure if it is making my hair grow though but it sure looks thicker.",1
this chips off within a day.  i am so disappointed!,0
"I went into this hoping for a miracle... and was a little disappointed. I used this nightly and my pimple didn't get any larger, but they didn't disappear either. Maybe I was expecting too much. I still use it as it does seem to be somewhat helpful and it doesn't bleach my clothes or sheets like other spot treatments do.",1
"I have some very prominent dark circles around my eyes and this cream only slightly reduced them, didn't really seem to help much with wrinkles either.  I've been using it for over a month and am very disappointed in the results. Definitely not worth the money as it behaves just like a normal eye moisturizer which can be purchased for a tiny fraction of the price.",0
"Terrible! It came leaking, the package was spoiled, I didn't expect this kind of quality of product for $66. I'm asking for replacement!
(See the images attached)",0
Amazing moisturizer,1
"Did not darken lashes...some length but I noticed also that the amount of lashes that  I was losing, was drastic! Would not recommend.",0
"This is a great fragrance, with a manly scent that is very distinctive but not over powering.  I have gotten great comments, both from men and ladies. My wife also enjoys it and was pleased the first time I tried it.
This was my second purchase of this product.  Thumbs up....",1
These make my lips dry and peeling.,0
It works great but isn't built to last. I went through 2 of them. The first one I used 3 or 4 times before it died. And the second one I used about 6 or 7 times before it died. This company is horrid for making this kind of product. When it does work it works really well. I'm so upset at this company!,0
"I was so glad to find this item at Amazon. I'd owned one for many, many years and it just kept going and going. It straightened my hair easily and beautifully. Then one day I made a mistake and dropped it into the sink where there was some water... Ooooh!  I wasn't able to find one at any salon or at the beauty supply shops. I purchased a different unit and it dried my hair badly, even though it was ""ceramic"".  I should have known to just go to Amazon.com.  When I saw it on Amazon, I purchased it immediately. Now I can straighten my hair without inflicting the amount of  damage as that 'other unit'",1
"I thought at least the redness or the bumps were gonna disappear but no 3 months later my arms look the same, I'm didn't use only the lotion moisturizing but the scrub and serum as well not even because I was using it daily, I'm seriously very sad about the results",0
"Wow, if you are looking for a little something to put with that new baby gift, this is it.  I love this lotion more than any baby lotion out there.",1
This left bumps on my face so  I gave it to my friend and she LOVES it. Couldn't give it a low rating because it just wasn't for me.,1
neck wrinkles aren't gone but may be softened,1
"I like this and the concept, I'm just not a huge fan of the color but that doesn't reflect the actual product. A lot of people will LOVE this color. It's a very soft white/pink heavy on the white. It is super trendy right now and because as a nail polish it went on smooth (although a bit streaky) I honestly think it is a great buy (hence the stars). For me personally, this color was way too light and doesn't really work with my skin tone (olive). I do love a light pink, it's the heavy white in this pigment that doesn't work for me -- but for a lot of people it will be perfect!

I do get gel nails regularly so after my last set came off I used this exclusively for two weeks and honestly think it DID improve the quality of my nails. I also take biotin every day but there is no doubt that regular gels will DESTROY your nails. I am glad to see that there is a product like this to help in between sets or for whenever your nails need a breather. Julep is a GREAT company and I have been to their brick and morter stores in Seattle quite a few times. Awesome product, just not a great color (on me).",1
"Absolutely love this product. My skin looks so fresh, poreless, and flawless when I wake up. Its fairly affordable to other products I have used, and a little goes a long way. The smell is light, and clean. This is a must have product, IMO.",1
"I don't generally care for conditioners, cream rinses, and leave-in products because they tend weigh down my fine, thin hair, leaving it limp and lifeless. Surface Bliss Smoothing Cream. however, is an excellent product. Just a pea-sized drop of this cream, smoothed from ends up to ears, leaves my hair bouncy and shiny. I then ""wipe off"" whatever is left on my palms from crown down to ears. The cream is extremely lightweight (more like a lotion) and it contains no gluten. I don't even need to rinse my hands afterward.

I use so little that this 4-ounce tube could last a year; however, I find that sometimes a little bit too much comes out the tube. I could ameliorate the dispense-by-gravity issue by storing on its side, not standing on its cap, as shown in the stock image. Love this. It has replaced all of my Phyto grooming aids in the bathroom closet.",1
"I love these products, great for sensitive skin. Wish we could go to their spa in France!!! I highly recommend",1
"This product really did nothing for my eyelashes. They were very much separated but it made them look sparse. It also was not conducive to holding a curl at all, and barely extended them. Very disappointed.",0
The first coat was too thin and watery!,0
"This hair dryer got WAY too hot and the airflow was WAY too powerful.  My hair got so tangled from the intense airflow and my scalp was burning on the Hot setting.  On the Warm setting it was ok, but would take way too long to dry my hair.  And it's heavy!",0
Does not hold a curl in my hair at all,0
doesn't help vinyl lux nail polish last as advertised and now there are so many drug store options that are more affordable I wouldn't bother with this product.,0
"My hair frizzes in the humidity and this spray keeps it straight, smooth and soft.  A great hold",0
"There are many good shaving creams out there, shave creams that minimize cuts and abrasions and are exceptionally smooth.  I particularly like American Crew's (http://www.amazon.com/American-Crew-Moisturizing-Shave-Cream/dp/B0014E24LO (http://www.amazon.com/American-Crew-Shave-Duo-Gift/dp/B002TTBH7A/ref=sr_1_3?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1357617225&sr=1-3&keywords=american+crew+shave and others).

But my favorite is: http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Shaving-Cream-Sandalwood/dp/B000I2XL4M/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1357617102&sr=1-1&keywords=arts+of+shaving.

"Have always liked and used many Pureology hair products.  This one is a major disappointment.  Has odd smell.  Also, makes the
hair feel brittle and stiff.  Going to toss it out.",0
"So far it works, my lashes are fuller but only slightly longer. I do have a slight dark area around my eye but not so noticible as others have indicated.",1
I like that this sunscreen is slightly tinted.  It goes on smoothly and blends well.  My only wish is that the SPF were 30 or higher instead of only 20.,1
"The fragrance is waaaaaay too strong. It's overpowering and somewhat like an old lady. The oil itself is great. But, the smell makes it unbearable.",0
"i used this product in my hometown. but it expansive than my hometown. however, i have to speak this product is very well!",1
To difficult to use and pulls your hair out.,0
it was hydrating but the color was way off what i expected gave  it away,0
"This curl control creme is one of the best I've ever used. I have coarse, unruly hair with medium-tight curl, and it tends to want to frizz out and just generally be completely out of control. Just a dab of this creme does a perfect job of taming the unruliness and frizz, leaving me with a lovely halo of perfect, soft curls, without the stiffness and ""crunch"" of a gel. The scent is on the sweet side for my taste, but it's pleasant enough, and also mild and understated, so it quickly fades to the background. Overall I think this is my favorite hair product currently on my shelf.",1
"drys beautifully, keeps hair healthy and smooth and cools it down at the end. I don't find it as lightweight and advertised but it's a fair trade off for healthy hair",1
"A bit pricy, but it is goog.",1
"I purchased this from my local salon; not from Amazon, and this is not the product that I remember. The fragrance is different; but more importantly the hold simply is no longer there. I began using this in the mid 1980's; and one round of spray held my hair all day, even in humid weather, it lived up to it's name, your style was frozen in place, no need to re-apply throughout the day. I just sprayed my hair, giving it time to dry, and I can run my fingers throughout, nothing ""Frozen"" in this product, it certainly doesn't live up to its name or reputation. Will not purchase again if doing so from a salon makes no difference, it's just good money wasted.",0
Best product I've used,1
it was very hydrating and a saw a difference in my skin immediately. I will continue to use and strongly recommend it.,1
"Truly amazing product. If you had any acne at all, this will stop it in it's tracks immediately. So great, will order again and again.",1
A bit messy to use.  Doesn't really do the job in my opinion unless you are covering a very small area.,0
"It's shampoo.  Used it for 3 months, there's nothing special about this that warrants the price.",0
Didn't feel anything special. It is pretty for displaying but not that functional product. I will just keep in my bathroom for displaying.,0
"I don't know what happened... maybe I got a bad batch. I have loved this lotion for years, but the bottle I got a few days ago smells like plastic. It smells nothing like the original. I am so bummed!",0
I used this product for 2 months and it did absolutely nothing for me,0
Love this product!,1
perfect to order,1
"Have been using for quite sometime . Good product, pricy for toothpaste, but seems to work. Especially like the pen to use when you can't brush.",1
Hope my hair doesn't fall out.  I read all the reviews about these products,0
"Can't believe I spent so much money on this product without trying it first. Well, live and learn. For starters, it smells a bit like curry. Not terrible, but a little odd. It was hard to apply as it didn't have any ""slip."" It dragged over my skin and didn't blend in well, leaving darker streaks. Where I rubbed it in, it seemed to sit on top and looked powdery. I looked like I had tried out a bad bronzer, and the surface was dry and flaky and not at all natural. I used it for a month or so, hoping for some skin benefit, but detected none. I finally tossed it, as it was taking up room in my cabinet, and only reminded me of my expensive error in purchasing it. (I switched to a BB cream. Less coverage, but the dry powdery look is gone.)",0
I have fine hair and really hate the feel of product in my hair.  This spray give a very light flexible hold and maintains the dryness or non-oily look I really crave.  I really love love it other than the price.,1
This can't be the regular tea tree conditioner.  It smells weird.,0
one of the items was open when I received it .,0
"This cream cones in an easy to expense pump. It was unlike many creams that I've used before. There was no oily or greasy feel when applying or after application. My face was left feeling soft and light, almost like nothing was on it. It does not really have a scent to it. I have continued to notice extremely soft and firmer skin with repeated use.",1
"I did not purchase this product on Amazon but still would like to review the conditioner and colorlast shampoo This product is horrible!!!! I used this product and soon after I started receiving horrible, very itchy, bumps on my thighs, legs, and around arm pit area. I wasn't sure if it was contagious and so I went to my dermatologist. They had no idea what is was But recommended allergy medicine and a cream for the itch. She recommended going to my primary doctor if it continued which I ended up doing. The rash continued and spread and my primary doctor did not know what it was. I was again prescribed some allergy medicines and they did a food allergy test which came back negative. Bottom line is I realized this was the only new product that was put on my body and then stopped using it. Magically the rash slowly went away after i discontinued use. The company said in order to get reimbursed for all these doctors bills and medicines was to submit a code stating the diagnosis. If my doctors could not identify the problem where would I get this code from??? The only way for me to prove that at this point is to start using their horrible product again and go see a dermatAlogist again and see if they can at this point diagnosis the bumps (which they couldn't the first time). No thank you! In my opinion not a good product at all, at least not for my skin.",0
"I bought this years ago and tried it for about 6 months, never did anything for me. I had moderate acne scars and still have those acne scars.",0
I watched TV advertisement that it makes teeth white. But its price $20. I tried. It is done nothing. But its price is 10 times expensive. The company deceived people.,0
"The color is bright red, almost in the pink range. Does not stain lips, creates rings of wear as the day goes on, water easily removes most of the product even hours later. The now discontinued Revlon lip stains were better",0
Will not use anything else! Evey thing I need in hair care along with the accompanying Hair and Scalp Treatment,1
"If I could give no stars, I would. Terrible product that made my hair super greasy and sticky.",0
Love it.  Will order again.,1
The best straightener ever! I totally recommend it. It literally cut my time and I can get my hair done faster. I am beyond happy with this product. This is my forever straightener.,1
I'm very very fair.......I couldn't tell if it was on my body at all. I got this hoping it would be a travel size replacement for my St. Tropez because i didn't want to deal with a mit and foam.,0
I like the product.  I wish light was truly light.  I am fair skinned and I have to make sure to blend well so that there are no lines.  I am a nurse and I find that this product does stay on the 12 hours I work.,1
perfect for hiding great roots until my next touch up,1
Very watery and not like the real thing.,0
"Have tried several products including Van Der Hagen, Colonel, Conk, Proraso, Kiss My Face and several others. This item here worked pretty well in terms of creating a good rich lather rapidly and lubricating the shave. However, I would still have to give a slightly better rating to Kiss My Face which I felt lubricated the razor a little better, gave me a slightly closer shave and in my personal opinion I prefer KMF's lime scent. Price was not a factor but just adding icing. KMF was about half the price. Only knock - the name!
UPDATE: After several months I am forced to downgrade this product. Since then I have tried a few others including Trufitt & Hill, Taylor of Old Bond Street, Geo F Trumper, Spieco Shaving Stick, and Art of Shaving and each of these outperformed Jack Black in terms of glide, closeness of shave, blood spilled, and irritation. In fact Kiss My face still remains my ""go-to"" cream if I had to choose only one product. To be more clear - I have tried this again recently and now I have designated it as second to worst - worst being shaving with kosher salt.",0
"The Sorme Believable Finish Powder can be applied wet or dry. This is a refill for the compact. The power itself is very lightweight yet it provides great coverage. I have rosacea and the redness can sometimes be embarrassing. But heavy foundations that have covered it in the past not only feel awful while I'm wearing them, rub off on everything I put against my face, but they also irritated my already sensitive skin. But the Believable Finish Powder provided enough coverage for me to feel comfortable (people assumed my rosacea after applying this powder was actually applied blush or a natural flush). It wasn't heavy at all, I never felt like I was wearing make-up. The color also blends incredibly well to my skin-tone which changes a little from summer-winter, yet I can continue to use the same pigment in Sorme. I live in the Midwest and this winter has been quite dry and harsh. The finish powder actually helps keep the hydration in my skin from my morning skin care products because of the Hydrating Jojoba Oil in it and it even gives my face a soft dewy look to last throughout the day.

It's clear that Sorme creates products that are for taking care of skin, not simply for covering it up. If you are looking for a lightweight feeling foundation versatile wet/dry powder that still provides medium coverage, then this is the one. It's worth spending the extra bucks on compared to other cheaper brands because you're not only getting what I just mentioned but you're also getting a product that is packed with essential ingredients to keep your skin healthy and young looking like Alpha Hydroxy acids and antioxidant Vitamin C stimulate cellular renewal to prevent aging.",1
"For my type of hair this works great!! i have tried it on my sister who has finer hair and it is good it just doesnt last as long, good news is that that is what hairspray is for!",1
"Love the face lotion, shampoo, and hand lotion.  The face wash is just OK.  The bar soap smells great, but isn't worth the price imo.  I will be buying the face lotion and shampoo separately in the future.",1
"The Man Made 18.21 products are obviously targeted at Millennial hipsters with cash to spare. The hair spray works well without being too stiff and looks natural. I drove around for about an hour in a convertible with the top down and my hair was held in place. Thats pretty good! The sweet tobacco scent is manly, and is strong when first applied, but dissipates quickly becoming more subtle. At least your dame, as the product page puts it, probably won't be borrowing it anytime soon. While 18.21 says the can looks like an old beer can from the prohibition days, to me it reminds me more of a can of WD-40. For a ten ounce can the price is kind of steep, but the fragrance of Sweet Tobacco is unique and the product holds well throughout the day.",1
Smells and feels absolutely amazing on your skin!,1
"WARNING!!!!!!!!!! Worse hair dryer EVER! Didn't last me 2 months! Kept turning off then finally quit! I took out the plug and looked at it, it was melted! I would give this hair dryer no stars if it would let me! WASTE OF MONEY!",0

"I was disappointed in the amount that it held. It covered well and was easy to use, but I wish it had lasted longer.",0
the plates do not come together tight enough,0
This is a very good product,1
"I really don't like saying this but I received a counterfeit product here. I've used the real product for yrs with good success . It always works well. When I started using this item, nothing happened. No lashes grew.
 I called my esthetician who lives in another town to order a tube from her for comparison. (By ordering from Amazon,I was just trying to save her the hassle of mailing me the GrandeLash-MD but I won't make that mistake again.) With the tube from her, lashes were growing within 3 days.
This packaging all looks authentic & the price is in line with the real product but I either received a tube filled with defective liquid or they're selling a counterfeit.
Review update: Someone replied that they called the company & were told it's only genuine if puchased  from amazon Luxury. I viewed my order & I purchased from amazon Luxury. To double check, I went to amazon Luxury & searched for GrandeLash. When the product was found in amazon Luxury the note, ""You purchased this in 3/18"" showed above the product. Amazon verifies I bought it in amazon Luxury.",0
Purchased for my daughter. I know she has bought it before so it must me a good product.,1
holds well no sticky o stifness,1
The mask came in a decent amount of time and in tact. Doesn't have a unpleasant order nut the amount you get for the price is small. As the mask dries on your face you can feel your face tightening up. Its not a peel off mask you have to rinse it off with warm water. After i rinsed it off my face still felt very tight and try  but very smooth. All you have to do is follow up with a toner and a moisturizer. I will buy another one once this jar is done.,1
my fave,1
This polish and all CND polishes do not last more that 2 days! I wash my hands 3-4 times a day and I also use the CND Top-coat (which I love) but the ends of my short nails start to wear in 2 days.!!  If I use an Essi polish with the CND top coat I get much longer lasting reults 5-6 days!!!,0
I love love love the silky texture of this power blush. And the color is awesome!!! Best blush EVER.,1
"This is a pleasently scented lightweight lotion for the prevention of newstretch marks and to help reduce the look of existing ones. As a new mom I'm using it for the latter purpose. The cream itself is moisturizing without stickiness or oiliness but it does take awhile to soak in and leave that nice matte feeling. I've been applying it to my stretch marks and while I feel it will be awhile before I know how well it works to fade them it is deeply moisturizing so I can definately see this going a long way towards preventing them.

The breast firming serum is the reason I'm giving this set as a whole four stars rather than five. It's thick and not nearly as pleasent to apply as the cream. It takes so long to soak in that I can only use it when I'm pretty sure I won't be nursing the baby soon. Even then I have to keep on an old shirt after I use it since I'm not comfortable getting it on the inside of my nursing bras. That said, I does seem to have a firming effect. For now I'll be saving it until my little one is older and I don't have to worry so much about timing the application of it.",1
"This is just what I wanted.  I like nail polish, but I like it low key.  This indeed is low key. It makes your nails look well groomed and polished.  I guess it is to me it's classy.  I took this to the nail salon because I am not very good with at home manicures.",1
love and great company,1
"This is a great product  for those with sensitive skin.  I can't count the number of moisturizers I've tried, from drugstore brands to the very expensive ones. But this is the only one that doesn't give me the breakouts or make my eyes tear.  And it keeps my skin feeling hydrated without feeling sticky.  Absolutely love this one.",1
"I may have just gotten a defective unit, but the wand does not heat up. I tried it in 4 different outlets without luck so will be returning it.",0
this came to me and the first thing I did was open it to smell it because i love the smell of this product BUT I was soon disappointed because it smells nothing like the others I have bought before so I tossed it because I honestly feel like they put another product into the bottle and tried to pass it off as the actual chi infra treatment because that scent was NOTHING like the scent of my other I already had that was almost gone because i did compare the smell and it was nothing like what i already had i will not be buying this product again from online i would much rather buy it from the beauty supply store where I know what i am buying because I can smell it first this was a huge waste of time as well as money because i tossed it out afraid to use it because I did not know what was really in the bottle i got from this seller so buyers be aware!!!,0
Worked great on my once naturally blonde hair...turned ORANGE with our well water...I have nolticed I have to use it every day or it begins to turn orange quite quickly. When I use it I can definatly tell a difference :) it did not turn it back to its original color yet....we also installed some expensive fliters so our water is clear now...but it still must have minerals turning my hair dingy. Overall I do love the product!,1
not the same strength as I had gotten from my Salon,0
"I was referred to this product by my sister. I have a medium tan complexion so many sunblocks I purchase leave an awful white cast. I really liked this one because it absorbed well and was mattifying for my skin.  However- I was out in the sun, and I got a sunburn on my cheeks. Going forward, I will continue using it for daily minimal sun exposure, but would recommend additional sunblock if you are going to be in the sun for more than 30  minutes. I will purchase the spf 45 next time",1
"This product did protect nail and stay on for a good long time, I did not notice any increased nail growth however.",1
"As others may have mentioned, this is not the pictured item.  I wanted the pictured item, this is a subpar substitute.  Does it do the job? Yes.  But the pictured model (tweezerman) was exceptional in comparison.",0
I loveeeeee this machine idk why it had any bad reviews ive done in total about 4 sessions on each leg and i am almost completely hairless i love it!! It didn't burn me at all but ive only ever used it on the 2 setting so maybe thats why. i seriously wish i could give this thing a higher review i will be posting pictures maybe in a few days cause i just shaved and did my fourth session so ill wait a week or so to show you guys what my legs look like and how much hair i have now. And let me add that each session i did was not in any kind of routine i did my first one then the 2nd in 3 weeks then the third like 3 months later (mostly out of lazziness lol) but it still did the damn job and im sure if i would have done them per say in a timely manner i would be completely done by now i love it srsly! I have the same results as a friend of mine who spent way more money getting hers proffesionally done w burns that are barley going away oh and this way is pain free!!!! Id like to add im hispanic and have light skin with darrrrk leg hair so im sure that made a difference on the results since i don't think it works on lighter/grey hair just an fyi,1
"Purchased for my elderly mother who constantly laments her thinning hairline. Although this is obviously a superficial solution, it does make her feel like she has more hair in front. A little tricky to apply (it is a fine powder, afterall), and tends to get all over the place. But used judiciously, desired results can be achieved with some practice. Not sure if she will repurchase, but at least for now it offers an easy solution for bald spots. It basically just colors your scalp like shoe polish, doesn't really thicken fine hair as claims.",1
Don't waste your money. I used it twice a day for 3 weeks on the back of my hands and absolutely no change on my hands at all. Is not much of a moisturizer either.,0
"Awesome razor!  Thought I would use the adjustability more but I don't. Started out trying it on ""3"". Very aggressive. I keep it between 1&2. Also it can be very slippery when wet so be careful. There is not much to grip onto when using it with soapy fingers.",1
"great moisturizer and not too greasy, mild fragrance",1
"This did work briefly and I liked how hot it got so quickly. However, it died after three months of daily use. Did not buy this brand again.",0
Wonderful as always. Can't go a day without it.,1
"It's going to take some getting used to since it is SUPER powerful.  It dries in lightening time, so styling is a bit of a challenge for this old dog.",1
"Keeps my hair smooth,shiny and smelling great",1
Does not take away my dry skin bumps like it says it will.,0
"My wife lost the one I had before this,and although it's not the same as my all Boars hair one I had it's still terrific.",1
"My wife purchased this and this review is from her:  Do NOT buy this product, it does not work as advertised. I was very excited to try it and followed the directions exactly but honestly, my hair looked worse after I used this and I tried it many, many times - do not waste your money!!",0
VERY STICKY!!,0
"This is NOT Lorac! I went to Ulta to buy the same foundation because this stuff was NOT IT. It was simple to apply but when it dried it was SUPER sticky. I came off pretty easy. I would not recommend this to anyone. I also told the lady at Ulta who was doing my foundation match about this and she stated Lorac DOES NOT permit Amazon to sell their product. So the company that is selling this, is scamming people. Just an FYI. Amazon is great, but this company is not.",0
Love this hair dryer! It cuts my blow dry time in half and leaves my hair much smoother! My mom has the step up from this one and it is great too!,1
This item was shipped in a box with other items I ordered and this item looked used! I had to tape and repair the box so i could wrap it!  And it was ordered as a gift!,0
Bought this when the grand children were coming for a visit...... Used what was left over on myself.... Love it!!,1
"I like the big pump bottle, makes it super easy to use. I have acne prone, combo skin. Dry in some places, oily in others. It says paraben free, color free...not sure how it's blue though. It has fragrance and SLS which I try to avoid in face products but otherwise I like the texture and my face feels good afterwards. My favorite facewash,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toleriane-Purifying-Foaming-Face-Wash-Cleanser-for-Normal-To-Oily-Senitive-Skin-13-5-fl-oz/dp/B01N34XW93/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toleriane Purifying Foaming Face Wash Cleanser for Normal To Oily Senitive Skin, 13.5 fl. oz.</a>&nbsp;also removes my eye makeup and doesn't have a scent. I'll use the Bioderma up, but I think I'll always go back to my favorite one.",1
"I took off 1 star because this stuff is pretty expensive, and (since it's a decently strong acid) you do have to figure out how to spray enough of it but avoid breathing it in at the same time.

But it gets a solid 4 stars because it WORKS - pretty quickly and pretty well.

You need to be careful about not over-using it, because that can really dry your skin out to the point that it will start flaking and peeling. This doesn't look or feel good and certainly won't help the underlying problem you're trying to treat. While what constitutes ""over-use"" will vary by individual, here's advice from someone who learned the hard way: as soon as the spray starts to sting, or the treated skin turns pink after spraying, back off use for at least a day or two.",1
"Does not provide good coverage for bruises, and it cakes.  I much prefer ""it"" brand's CC+.",0
"Utilized it religiously as directed. As with all of y other StriVectin products, I see no change for the better whatsoever.",0
"I've been using this toner for over a month and I'm crazy about it! Although this is marketed towards men, I'm a 39 year old woman and it's been wonderful for my very sensitive, slightly oily skin. I use it after I wash my face and it removes all traces of makeup. It doesn't dry my skin out and it has helped to clear up any hormonal breakouts that I get. This toner has a very pleasing herbal mint scent that is unisex. My skin feels refreshed and looks healthy. I couldn't be happier and I recommend this for both males and females.",1
Very pretty nail color and nice product overall.  I have several OPI colors and am highly satisfied with them all.,1
"Paul Mitchell's Tea Tree Shaping Cream is a wonderful hair product for the man that might have a thinner head of hair.  It allows you to shape your hair in any of the current styles, without highlighting the fact that your hair is thinner than others.",1
"Its pretty good, especially for the price.  I would buy it again.",1
So thick! and looks cakey and settles into fine lines. its ok if you thin it out with a moisturizer  but then you aren't guaranteed an even sun protection so defeats the purpose of the SPF. Was really disappointed,0
I have been an OPI fan since the '80's and continue to use their products.  Absolutely love their top coat!,1
"I usually LOVE HOT tools/Hot Shot Tools products, but I'm pretty disappointed with the performance of this iron. I have really heavy, thick, wavy hair so it's hard for my hair to hold a curl, but I fell in love with this brand when I found my 1 in barrel ceramic Hot shot tools curling iron. That was the first curling iron I ever found that was capable of holding my curls all day long. I took a real leap of faith when I tried this metal (as opposed to ceramic) iron. It had rave reviews and results photos from customers on Amazon so I thought I'd give it a whirl- thank goodness it wasn't too expensive because my curls fall out immediately. At best, I have a few waves at the bottom of my hair after trying to curl it for almost an hour. This iron takes a really long time to get hot, and just doesn't work that well on my heavy, thick hair. You can try your luck and maybe you'll have results like some of the other customers, but if you're like me try ceramic. I regret my decision to stray from my good ol' tried and true.",0
This is a very good product. My local barber shop carries the exact brand. In my opinion this is the best one on the market,1
It's so hard to rinse off.. So far not so good :(,0
This works well but still keeps a soft feel to the hair.  It has a  strong men's cologne smell though.,1
This straighter stopped getting hot after about 3 months. It will not get hot at all anymore.,0
"This FHI hairdryer medium and high power quit working after about 7 months.  Loved this lightweight, professional quality hair dryer until then (purchased June 11th from Amazon LLC)..  Expected it last for a few more years at $132.  Amazon return policy is only 30 days.  Will look for a replacement somewhere else. Be wary.",0
not I thought,0
1 bottle was completely dried out.  Not pleased,0
"Magic in a bottle. nothing compares to this shampoo. ive tried other tea trea products, rosemary etc. this is the one. paul mitchells best work.",1
"Below quality and performance for the price. Extremely aggressive,uncomfortable and poor shaving perfomance results. Much better razors well under $20 that exceeds the performance and quality issues.",0
Do not waste your money!!,0
Did not work like the first tube I bought-doesn't dry very quickly & rubs off immediately...also clumpier than I remembered.,0
"Has the WORST scent!  Makes me nauseas.  Who knows if it actually works, I already got a few stretch marks.  I think they are just hereditary because I have been lathering this stuff on like crazy and I have only gained 10 lbs at 6 months pregnant.",0
"Love this stuff.  Silky texture makes hair soft, manageable and shiny.  You don't have to use half the bottle to get full coverage, so it lasts a long time.",1
Good product.,1
This was a gift to another person and they loved it.  The vendor was helpful and prompt would use them again.,1
great one i like it,1
Great smell and lasts all day.  Great price. Much cheaper than department stores.  I get a lot of compliments on how this smells.,1
"Don't let the pix (or other reviews) fool you.
Actual size equals a small eyeshadow...and the product works about as well as that would.  Brushes out - is NOT waterproof or sweat-proof at all.
Save your money - and just buy cheap eyeshadow....and put the savings toward a professional salon appointment.
I'll bet the reviews were posted by employees.  Coughripoffcoughcough",0
Works as well as Biolage,1
"I have cystic, hormonal acne and I heard that Mario Badescu products work well. I purchased this and the Buffering Lotion and the Buffering Lotion works SO much better at reducing my acne than this does. This one is messy, application is weird (you have to apply it with a qtip or something else you can dip into the sediment at the bottom of the bottle) and the ingredients are essentially calamine lotion and alcohol. It also did nothing for my acne. I know this works for many people, so Im guessing it works better for white heads and smaller breakouts, however cystic acne tends to respond better to sulphur- based products (this is definitely true for me) and the Buffering Lotion is sulphur-based.",0
"Bought this on Amazon less than 4 months ago, and yesterday morning, it burned off a whole strand of my hair!!!! Really???!!!",0
"Until recently when my salon quit carrying this product I never purchased online. I won't again either. It doesnt have the same quality as my salon purchase. Needed loads to create any kind of lather, the conditioner was as bad or worse.",0
"The oil is very good, making my hear softly",1
"What is the voltage?
I bought one and used it only twice and did not heat after it",0
Used for 8 months. I don't any improvement.,0
Not to expensive. Not overkill hold. No aggressive odor as I never want to greet people smelling like hair products. My go to for easy styling.,1
"I agree with previous reviewers that this is either a very old product or a knock-off.  The gel should be blue with no odor, but the first several pumps came out black with a very strong metallic smell like rust.  No way I'm putting it on my face.  I've used Glytone for many years, and like the real product, but what I was sent was defective.  Amazon gave me a refund and fast.  Excellent customer service from Amazon.",0
"Smell doesndoesn't last, it's not original",0
"This will be my third 33 oz bottle. This is a very light oil with a clean fresh scent. I use as a shower gel, or 4 or 5 pumps in my bath water. It does not leave the tub slick or greasy, but leaves my dry itchy skin feeling soft and soothed. I recommend it.",1
"I love these products. My hair looks great and feels very clean, while protecting the color. Also, I have had a problem with ""natural ingredients"" in other products making my scalp blister. This line of products has no adverse effect on my scalp.
I cannot find it in a store my area so I order it. The orders have come in a timely manner and are well packed.",1
"After reading the ""hype"" about this product, I ordered it and used it as directed.  It did not do one thing
it was advertised to do.  I would not buy it again.",0
Bad color application. Not the correct color according to what it should be. Was as if the tube was old. Returned it,0
"Very nice product, on time delivered!",1
"This product did not work for me at all. I have long hair and hoped that I could have that slick straight salon hair results with this. Unfortunately,  the brush was disappointing. it just didn't do much for me. I was able to straighten my hair but it still looked puffy no matter how many times I went over the same strand of hair.  I had to return it for the amount of money it costs. I purchased another product which I am liking and I can straighten my hair right out of the shower and it cost less!

Smell doesnt last long i think i got a fake. However it does smell good just wish it lasted longer,0
"Love the products and was thrilled at the price, however the case was filthy. Thankfully this wasn't a gift because I would have had to repackage everything.",1
This under eye cream worsened my under eye area. It made it flaky and grainy and my eyes lost their lustre. My eyes also felt heavier and puffy. I will not be purchasing this again.,0
Got wrong product.,0
"Just tried these - the product was recommended by my acupuncturist for hair loss (due to stress).  All three products produce a tingling sensation, sort of like putting Ben-gay on your head.  Make sure you don't get it in your eyes.  The sensation gets more intense the longer you leave it on.  (It is similar in feeling to the Nioxin products if you've tried those).  I've only used it twice, so I don't know if it works yet, so only 4 stars for now.  But, my hair gets really frizzy and curly when it starts to grow, and the Bosley does a good job of controlling frizz and making my hair shiny, so I'm happy with it.",1
I just tried this product today. Many say it is messy. It isn't too messy when you apply but as it dries its a bit powdery. My skin felt soft afterward. Good product! Will update review after a few uses.,1
"My Mom must've given me this stuff at some point, because I found it in my bathroom closet while digging in desperation one humid day, and I know I never bought it. I can't believe how well it works! I buy it all the time now! I just finger-comb it through my hair while it's damp, and it keeps my hair looking amazing all day, no frizz, but also not looking extra ""crunchy"" or wet, or any of the other weird things that curly hair products usually do to my hair. It just ends up looking natural and soft and curly and people compliment me more than ever! It's really effortless, and one other thing I love - it doesn't leave my hands sticky, which was a huge aversion when I realized I'd have to finger-comb the product, but it really makes a huge difference in the final outcome of both how the product is distributed and how my hair ends up looking.

I seriously feel like I finally hair the curly hair I was promised when I was born with it ;)",1
I was very skeptical that this stuff would work but it really did.  It took a few weeks to notice but I was pleasantly surprised.  Would definitely recommend!,1
great product,1
I usually love my Lorax glosses but this color separates and does not apply well at all.  Bleeds off onto my teeth and is not a good selection overall.,0
This leaves my curly dry hair feeling soft and so beautiful.  I prefer the Minu and Love Curl.,1
"Apparently they don't give a damn about their customers. The last time I purchased something from them I was automatically signed up for a 30-day replenishment for $35 a month. I never agreed to the subscription and I didn't even know about it until I was charged for it a month later. Customer service told me they won't do anything about it and that I had to have seen it on the website, which I obviously did not. Oh, and when I went to where the dumb ass rep told me to go, guess what? There was no mention of an automatic subscription. So now, I'm out $35 and I still can't figure out how to cancel the bloody subscription. I'm not sure I have ever been so angry at a company before. I felt like they absolutely couldn't care less about me as a customer there. I will most certainly never be purchasing another product from them, which is a shame since I actually liked their products.",0
Great,1
The stand broke after one year so I had to spend another $50 to buy another one !,0
Wow this has staying power! Not at all waxy and not like plain petroleum.  Very nice for dry lips.,1
Disappointed. Only active ingredient is Menthol. Pretty pricey for that.,0
I had used the La Roche-Posay Anthelios 50 Anti-Aging and loved the way it made my skin feel - moisturized and matte.  This is really oily and shiny.  Would not order again.,0
"Didnt smell as good as I hoped,nor any better than other cheaper conditioners",0
"I actually use an electric Norelco shaver for my face though I know this is typically used for the straight edge manual blade type razor. However, I noticed my neck area was getting quite dry after I shaved and decided to give this a shot. The scent doesn't last very long but that's fine as I'm not getting it for the scent but for the moisture anyways. It's pricey but it works and I only need to use about 2 large pea size so it will last awhile. I'd expect the product to last about 10 to 12 months with how I'm using it. Honestly, I thought L'Occitane only made women's products and was surprised when I found this. It's worth it!",1
I have used for years & ordered from Amazon several times.. Last order is very disappointing Not sure what is wrong with product.. it has always lengthen my lashes.. With last order no results!!!!!,0
I just realized the name was different! The picture shows fatgirlslim but my product shows fabgirlslim! I think that's a fake goods!,0
I've used pureology multiple times and ordered it from Amazon before without problem. However with my most recent order think the shampoo is either defective or expired because it comes out very watery. It smells like it is suppose to however I can't even get my hands through my hair once I rinse out the shampoo. Definitely disappointing and I would recommend spending the extra money getting it from the salon or store to guarantee the correct product and ingredients.,0
received the wrong size product (1.7 oz instead of 4 oz).,0
Made my hear very unmanageable.,0
"This looked like a good hairdryer when I unpacked it, but the hose will not stay attached to the bonnet and if you hold it by hand, the hot air never gets to the front and top of the bonnet.  It's basically useless.",0
I will definitely purchase again. My barber used this on me once and I became hooked. Washes right out in the shower as it is water soluble. Does not leave a stinky residue on the hands it holds the style in place incredibly well.,1
"I only condition my hair once a week. Even using this sparingly, it seems to leave my hair flat no matter what hair products I use. If you aren't doing anything else to your hair, the conditioner is great. Leaves your hair soft and stays that way all week.",1
"If you really know this lotion, you would have notice that they changed the formula.  I have used this for over 25 years but now I'm looking for a new product.",0
I applied mine 2 nights in a row. My eyelids are burning and its red . Whats this mean? It feels too harsh or something. Is it normal ? Or is this also fake product ?,0
Needs to be turned very high to flat iron hair,1
Love this stuff it's cheap on Amazon and although it's a bit oiler then other options as a daily clean up its great and nurishes your brushes...I would use a deep clean shampoo on them once a week also however,1
It's ok...I hate the curve of the handle. I used it twice and gave it away...hated how it felt in my hand because it felt awkward.,0
loved this dryer until it started smoking and almost caught fire. Had it about 2 years. So sad!,0
Avoid this product!! It's fake and will ruin your hair,0
It was excellent,1
Wonderful sampling of fragrance.  I love them all.,1
"Best lotion on the market, little pricey but worth the money!",1
love,1
"I really like Pureology Essential Repair Conditioner.  It helps tame my hair so no more frizzies, makes it shiny and soft. Also has a wonderful, clean scent.",1
Be careful not too use too much as it weighs your hair down but with the right amount its one of my favorite hair products!,1
This is amazing for sun burns and for itchiness. Love this product,1
Sounded very good in the write up. When I used it however the lather dried up too quickly.,0
This is all I will use... Goes on smooth and never cakes. People think I look younger than my age!,1
Really nice. Goes on very smoothly and lasts awhile. Iredale products are always good.,1
My Tria unit stopped working randomly and when I called customer service they were completely useless. It wouldn't charge at all so I'm guessing something happened to the battery as I had some weird goopy stuff seeping out of the unit for several days. The entire machine ended up being shot and I have always taken great care of it. Spent wayyyy too much money on a unit that died within a year of owning.,0
"I work in fashion so I've used dozens of hair products over the years. Without a doubt, this is the worst product I've ever used. In your hair, it starts off nice- not too shiny and it doesn't look like you have a lot of product. At first. About an hour or so into your day y'all notice that your hair looks like you sprayed it with vegetable oil. If it's warm out, it may also look like the oil has slid down onto your face.

Shortly after that you'll notice that your hair has started to collect dirt and dust. Later that night when you try to wash it out-well, let's just say ""good luck."" Shampoo rinse repeat, shampoo rinse repeat, shampoo rinse repeat...you'll still have product in your hair. Kind of many others have mentioned, even after shampooing three or four times your towel will be covered with product and it won't come off your hands for hours.

Finally, if you have sensitive skin at all, avoid this like the plague. The first ingredient is wax; the next ingredient is mineral oil. Oil picks up dirt and bacteria, slides right into your pores, only to get covered by a layer of wax, where the bacteria can have a party. The result? Breakouts galore.

I normally love Paul Mitchell products, but you literally could not pay me enough to use THIS product again.  As an alternative, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paul-Mitchell-Men-by-Paul-Mitchell-Mitch-Reformer-Strong-Hold-Matte-Finish-Texturizer-for-Men-3-Ounce/dp/B005NWO9G6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paul Mitchell Men by Paul Mitchell Mitch Reformer Strong Hold/Matte Finish Texturizer for Men, 3 Ounce</a>&nbsp;gives a similar (though not quite as ""sturdy"") hold and look with MUCH better long-term results (and no blemishes).

Not worth the money !! Product smells like morrocan oil but scent does go away fairly fast!! Very runny when I opened it!! The texture is more like suntan lotion instead of body soufle it moisturizes yes but nothing out of the ordinary !! The price is way excessive and a waste. !! I highly recommend pre de provence body butter 15 dollars it's smells divine and mosturizes to the maximum!!  Can be found everywhere even walgreens !! It's a french found in all the french pharmacies but is super,0
"Got taken again!  Been using for a few weeks,  no improvement.",0
"For the price, I was expecting bigger sized samples, so I was pretty disappointed when I saw how small they were (except for maybe 2-3 of them). If you are expecting decent sized samples, this isn't the sample box for you.",0
"I will eventually order every bar of soap made by Lafco...I'm just in love with their beautiful scents, how well they lather, and how long they last. Even my mother is a big fan now.",1
Leaves creases,0
This doesn't work and it was so expensive!  Don't believe the ads.,0
The color is EVERYTHING! However...it felt so dry on the lips and started on crumble apart if you dares to move your lips to much or touch any sort of food/drink. Forget about layering...not possible without looking like a crumbling mass. Not sure if it is a fake version or if all lipstick from this brand is like this. Dissapointint because I love the color so much.,0
"i think the oil is okay. i only use it twice a week as i first tried to use it every day and my hair was so greasy.
my biggest issue is the pump mechanism.  every time i pump it to get oil, it also leaks out the side of the cap that you push down.  so i'm wasting so much oil (and it's expensive!) and my counter is so greasy!  i wouldn't buy this again just for that reason.",0
WORKS GREAT......ONE LESS STAR FOR LEAVING RESIDUE,1
Sticky,1
Love it,1
I'm in love with this product.,1
"Lightweight, relatively quiet, good ergonomic shape so you don't accidentally push the wrong buttons :)",1
Probably one of the best for dry feet,1
This didn't work for me. It seems to just be nothing more than gel. It didn't give my hair anymore volume than before. It only made it tangle more.,0
I have fine curly hair ! This product works great because it wasn't too heavy for my fine hair but holds my curls all day without feeling sticky or crunchy. I would recommend anyone with curly hair gives this a try! I love it!,1
Got this one on a recommendation. Was looking for something a little less expensive than the FHI Heat hair dryer I had for 8 years until the buttons finally stopped moving after so much use. I am disappointed. It makes my hair dry and frizzy. I am going to spend the money on getting another FHI heat nano pro 2000.,0
"Picked this up at my wife's request. I myself obviously know nothing about makeup but she was excited to try this. My first observation was that this item is pretty small considering the price. But apparently I am wrong in thinking that way. My wife practically ripped the package out of my hands and couldn't wait to try it. I personally have never had a problem with the way my wife looks but she felt she needed this item. After using it for a week she says that it is amazing. It covers the blemishes on her skin and does a good job if concealing the ""bags"" under her eyes. I have noticed a slight difference when she uses it but as long as she is happy that's what matters. And I guess she is because she has already more products in the line.",1
I like the product but this bottle was defective. Unable to dispense the soap and not way to get a return or replacement. That will teach me to buy it months in advance of when I need it. Very disappointed,0
I don't need to use makeup any longer..It's perfect and protect my skin very well from sun. I love Avene.,1
Amazing!! It's so refreshing and great. It smells amazing. I use it as a setting spray to take away the powdery look but it doesn't really make my makeup last. But I would still say this thing is my favorite for a refreshing mist. Makes me feel great girly :),1
"I had some irritation the first week as indicated on the instructions.  Still having some breakout problems, but not nearly as bad.  I will keep using!",1
WTH???this butter basecoat is hald the size of the last bottle....it coast more per oz than gold....never again,0
lots of work for no results,0
It's like Altoids in a paste.  And the minty freshness is gone too soon!,0
Smells fantastic and left my hair soft and with volume,1
My mother uses this all the time.,1
A very good product.,1
"Perfect color for a beach vacation! It has an iridescent sheen to it to give it a ""mermaid"" look. Arrived in perfect condition. Well packaged.",1
"Nice, but seems a little pricey for basically chap stick with lemon scent.",0
"I've used it for over a week and haven't seen much difference. Actually it caused a little bit of redness and peeling so didn't keep using it (see review update below). I did put it on my neck and felt that it was softer. I think it is meant to be used in conjunction with the Vichy products for maximum benefits but as a stand alone treatment like I used it is not so good. It is an off-white lotion that absorbs well into the skin, I didn't feel any greasiness or anything like that, and I wore it under my makeup just fine.

Review update: 11/8/15

So I decided to give this one another try because I think that the negative experience I had before was due to me using other products at the same time. Sure enough, my skin didn't show any signs of irritation and felt much softer after using it for about 2 weeks. The smell is actually pleasant, not sweet,  just a soft clean smell. I use it at night and it works quite nicely in conjunction with my moisturizer.",1
Love this blinc mascara it is all I use.  Never smear and makes my eye lashes look so long.,1
"Excellent quality!

Unfortunately these razors cut up my face pretty good.

Be hesitant to use safety razors if you have sensitive skin or some acne/ingrown hairs. You'll end up aggravating it all and make it red and inflamed.

I spent 2 weeks with large red bumps on my face trying to get used to it, I didn't. And it was slightly embarrassing.

Gillette, while expensive, does the job very well.",1
"I have redness mainly on my neck, and hoped this would fade the redness some. I really couldn't tell much difference in using this. It goes on light green and settles in the lines of my neck. This might be ok for some people, but it really didn't work for my needs.",0
I have used this to blend bronzer into my foundation and it works well if I hold it sideways.  I believe it may be meant to blend foundation and powder (I'm not that sophisticated about makeup quite honestly).  Overall it's well made though I do wish that it retracted so I could put it in my makeup bag.,1
no Lily of the Valley smell.. Smells  like lemons. I hate it. First Floris prefume I have ever positively hated.,0
Does not control oil as well as advertised.  Oily skin was back within one hour.,0
I really like this item that because I had a Clarisonic for a number of years and like that I can with less expense purchase and interchange the cleaning heads. I think it was a great buy and the shipment was spot on.,1
This is my second purchase. When I wear my natural hair straightened I use this to add moisture but prevent reversion.,1
"DO NOT BUY
When I put this product on my hair it made giant white balls. It was disgusting and felt like I was wearing Vaseline in my hair.
Gross product!!!!!
You might as well sneeze in your hand and place it in your hair.",0
The best you can buy!,1
"Daughter in law surprises a lot and this was one of those gifts I wasn't sure of, but she sprayed it on her face as soon as she opened it.  Who knew,it's water! What ever floats your boat.",1
Product expired 10/2014. Cannot use it,0
"Love this conditioner, even though it is expensive it is worth it!  The only downside is the container - I've had two bottles of this conditioner where the cap has arrived broken or the seam at the end of the bottle was split.  More a huge design flaw.  The bottle should be less Haute Couture and more practical - it's conditioner after all!",1
It did nothing to help make my hair appear thicker. It just made a mess.,0
Get compliments on this all the time from women.,1
I love the Clarisonic! My face feels so good after each use --- skin feels super cleansed & massaging feeling during use. I would not hesitate to recommend this product.,1
"The Marcel handle takes practice but if you are patient enough it works so much better than a regular curling iron. I had my hairstylist show me because everyone in her salon uses these. I've used the 1 1/4in marcel iron for three years and it's the best for my long thick hair.

Here's the downside...

This brand of marcel curling irons break. A lot. Far more than they should. I have used them consistently for three years and I've gone through 6 marcel curling irons that are the hot tools brand. The issues with them are a plethora of things. Here are all the different things that have happened to my hot tools marcel curling irons (these didn't all happen at the same time, just a list of the issues from all 6):

-The hot part of the wand becomes wobbly and like it's going to break off (not something you want to happen on an iron that can burn you in a millisecond!)

-The plastic covering on the bar where you hold it to open and close the wand comes off. This happened to almost all of them that I have owned. The little bulb thing on the end gets cracked and when it comes off, the rest of the covering goes too.

-It turns on but doesn't stay on...electrical issue with the cord going into the wand. If I rotate the handle a certain way it stays on but the moment I pick it up to use it, it's off.

-It simply won't turn on at all.

-Turns on but doesn't get hot

I've asked my hairstylist if she has had the same issues and she said never. I don't really get it though...I've bought 6 of them and I don't believe I'm overly aggressive here...I'm not banging them against the wall or anything. I have regular curling irons and other hair appliances for years, even a decade. But not this one.

It's disappointing because it does work so well.",0
The best leave in detangler  I have ever bought. It makes my hair so full of body and my comb just runs thru my hair now. Absolutely I have zero tangles. This stuff is a miracle. I love this stuff. I totally recommend anyone to try it.,1
Quick shipping and packaged well. I love this product!! It works so well and smells so good! I have used many dry shampoos and texturizing sprays and this one is by far the best. Worth spending the extra money on.,1
"Works well for smaller pimples, but not as well for those inflamed pimples, blind pimples, etc.",1
"Smells horrible and I saw no results. I did like how the pink adds a shimmer, but again, not worth the price just for a shimmer and again, smells so bad.",0
"This was a big waste of money, I have used other blinc products mascara, lash primer, brow gel and mousse and all are wonderful was looking for a pencil because I liked the liquid liner so much but wanted something a bit thicker. It didn't go on very well and when it did go on tended to make a raccoon eye effect and irritated my eyes to the point they were burning. I have sensitive eyes and other blinc products have been the only ones I've found that I can use so not sure if this pencil was defective or if it is just not compatible with my body.",0
"I bought this to replace my Light Stim.  I do believe in red light therapy for wrinkles, and have been using it for about 5 years.  I'm in my mid 50's, and most people mistake me for 5 to 8 years younger.  It does seem to help with increased collagen production, and decreasing even deep wrinkles.  They won't disappear, but they will look better.  I also use it on my hands, and see a noticeable difference in skin clarity and firmness.  I would recommend, however, it is a bit pricey, and does take time to fit this in to your routine.  They recommend 5 days a week, and it takes about 30 minutes or so depending on the areas you are treating.  This does have a 3 minute timer built in, which is nice.  The Light Stim did not.  Recommend if you have the time to fit in to your routine.",1
"If you have thick hair pay the extra $10 for a curling iron that gets hotter. This one doesnt hold the curls for very long. Just traded this one in for the babyliss pro. I'm giving this one away to my sister, who has thinner hair. Hope it works for her!",0
I love this color and was so excited to get it but the polish came badly packaged and smashed to pieces. I'm still in the middle of hopefully getting a replacement but there are no returns with this product. I'll update as my claim progresses :/,0
"My skin is very acne prone and I noticed this spray made me break it out like CRAZY! I couldn't believe it! I heard such great things about it so this was obviously very disappointing. I used this spray for roughly a week because I wanted to actually see if it would work for me. It did NOT. My break outs continued to worsen throughout the week and once I discontinued this spray, my face cleared up immediately! I know everyone's skin is different so I would say give it a try but don't get your hopes up.",0
"very pleased with Serum.

Betty",0
Use these for dark shadows when highlighting and on contouring - see maskcaras blog on how to use- really helps,1
Very good,1
"It is very mild on the skin. Even if you leave it over the stated time, you will not feel or see
Any rash.",1
"Before i read lots of comments about this and everyone was happy with that so i bought it. Now i'm happy too with my beautiful, loose and natural curls. Easy to use and you can get result really fast. Very good product. I recommend it to everyone who love curls.",1
Can never go wrong with hot tools :) This is a great product.,1
"my 3rd buy..i so love the unique elegant smell..its youghtfull, energetic and yes its not a smell you always sense in the market, church or parties... and it lasts long!",1
"There is absolutely no vitamin out there that can allow you to have beautiful skin, hair and nails like this one. You can see the results in about 1 week. The biggest drawback about this product is that once you stop using it, your hair and nails go back to somewhat of its original state after a few months. Great to use if you want to give your hair, skin and nails a little boost once in awhile.",1
Nice cleansing shampoo,1
Item arrived and was broken. Could not be used.,0
"I usually LOVE Hot Tools products, but this one never worked properly.  The first time I plugged it in it never got warm so I returned it.  So sad because my last Hot Tools curling iron lasted years!",0
Great product,1
"For me,  it makes my hair powdery and takes the luster out of it.. Tigi's Dirty Little Secret Dry Shampoo works so much better.",0
"I've purchased Olaplex No 3 from my hair before and have had wonderful results, so upon needing a new bottle, I opted to order through Amazon as it came with Prime shipping. As always, my item arrived promptly and I immediately lightly cleansed and towel-dried my hair, as the instructions state, before applying this.
I first noticed that the Olaplex did not come sealed. How it managed to not spill everywhere is a surprise to me, but I still carried on with my application. Unfortunately, as the reviews claim, I'm pretty sure that this is not authentic OR at the very least, is a watered down version of the real Olaplex No 3. Everything about the consistency was off and moreso than that, the results that I am typically familiar with simply were not there! Just to be safe, I would advise purchasing Olaplex from Sephora or your hairdresser because it seems like the product sold through Amazon can be hit or miss.",0
Great & lightweight enough for summer use.,1
I have not seen a difference. Very disappointed,0
"I ordered this for my daughter after reading reviews.  I will admit that I was a bit skeptical considering the low price. As it turns out, she LOVES this.  Her hair is long and this seems to work perfectly.  There was, however, one problem and that is the ""arm rest"" (for lack of a better description) came off and this presents a bit of a problem.  Otherwise, a good price for very good results!!",1
"I've been using the product for 4 sessions now and it looks like it did slowed the growth of hair.  I used this under my nose, legs, bikini line, stomach and underarm. I use the epilator currently once a week for my legs and underarm.  Previously I used it twice a week or more. one area that i really noticed that the product  is effective is the below the nose and above the lips (mustache area).  I see very think hair or not at all.  I used the lowest setting.  I still have 4 more sessions to go.  The instruction is 8 sessions every 2 weeks.  After which you can use the product as needed. So will see what happens.",1
"I ordered this item for my girlfriend as a Christmas present specifically because the description says it comes with a diffuser and that's what she asked for. This item however does NOT come with a diffuser, so we are returning it for a different item. I just wanted to share that for anyone else who is looking for a hair dryer with a diffuser.",0
"I have always disliked mint in anything but ice cream, and I do NOT want my mouth to tingle.  I was delighted to find the Green Apple, which leaves my teeth smooth and my mouth feeling clean without the harshness of mint or the cloying sweetness of most toothpastes.  It's not abrasive like so many other tooth products, so I don't have to worry about scrubbing the enamel away.",1
"No waterproof.  Smudged right away.  Very disappointed.  I do have very oily eyelids, so hopefully this will be better for others.",0
Made my hair break.,0
"Not for flat iron protection. My hair smelled burned all day and when it got wet that night in shower. I will use it up as shine spray only.
Too $$$ for shine spray.",0
"These ties are small, best for children.  They might have impact if you wear them all at once.  Also you can't get them wet.",0
"Be prepared, my tube was empty",0
Love this stuff. It's much better than the Garnier one with the pink top (that one burns my eyes)...but I don't know if I can justify spending 3 times as much money on La Roche-Posay.,1
The color is not that pink as in the picture. It's more brownish,0
"horrible, its color makes you teeth look orange; smudges all over my face and is really hard to apply. save your money and skip this one",0
"I tried these after having success with another brands (The Magic Pads), just to see if all pads were created equal. NO WAY! After only a few days, my stubborn breakouts returned, so did my excess oil and I began to see cystic acne pop up again. I disliked the lack of texture to the pads as well. I know everyone's skin reacts differently, but these just are not for me.
I ended up throwing away almost a full bottle.",0
"It glides through you hair without pulling and catching your hair.
There needs to be an option of time 30 min or 45 min before it starts beeping and you have to turn it off then back on.",1
allergic reaction,0
"I usually LOVE HOT tools/Hot Shot Tools products, but I'm pretty disappointed with the performance of this iron. I have really heavy, thick, wavy hair so it's hard for my hair to hold a curl, but I fell in love with this brand when I found my 1 in barrel ceramic Hot shot tools curling iron. That was the first curling iron I ever found that was capable of holding my curls all day long. I took a real leap of faith when I tried this metal (as opposed to ceramic) iron. It had rave reviews and results photos from customers on Amazon so I thought I'd give it a whirl- thank goodness it wasn't too expensive because my curls fall out immediately. At best, I have a few waves at the bottom of my hair after trying to curl it for almost an hour. This iron takes a really long time to get hot, and just doesn't work that well on my heavy, thick hair. You can try your luck and maybe you'll have results like some of the other customers, but if you're like me try ceramic. I regret my decision to stray from my good ol' tried and true.",0
"Very good product
I did find the bronzer to be a little darker than I expected so I mixed it with a lighter fiundation",1
"WARNING: it tastes like butt but if you power through, your breath will smell like flowers!  :D",1
amazing product!,1
"Elemis is a fairly new line of skin products. I have used their moisturizer and cleanser, and I liked the way my skin felt after use. You need to be careful with oils, they can at times cause breakouts if they are too heavy. I use this oil on my lines and wrinkles, and I have a few. I could tell the quality of this facial oil is high. I like using it on my problem spots on my neck, chest, and hands. I can feel the difference in my skin and there's no residue.

This oil leaves my mature skin soft and ready for makeup and moisturizer. I use 3-4 drops of the oil in the morning and in the evening. My skin looks and feels softer.  I have some skin dryness, and the oil has been effective.  This oil penetrates deeply, leaving my skin feeling silky and visibly more full and supple but not greasy. Sometimes I use it all over my face but in the warmer months I will use it on my lines and wrinkles.

Recommended. prisrob 08-14-17",1
Don't know what all the fuss is. The scent is hardly amazing.  I basically use it when I'm not going anywhere trying to impress people.  Wouldn't buy it again. Just doesn't do much for me.,0
Love the sunscreen but this is a free sample you'd receive with purchase from a dept store. Not much in it. I bought it to try it out. Tint is very minimal.,1
"Pros:  masks thinning areas, color matches well, covers areas well
Cons:  product be messy at first until you learn how to apply it, you need hairspray to lock in the product, if you have a spot that is totally bald, this may not work very well

Get the applicator.",1
"The temperature control isn't consistent or accurate. Even on the lowest setting, it heats up way too hot for my hair and is steaming while using it. I've had the same product for 20 years and never had this issue before. I'm afraid to use it.",0
I am so glad I tried Proraso and a DE razor! I'm never going back to gel and crap 3 razors. This soap with the green after shave is amazing!,1
"nail polished turned yellow. I was unhappy with the quality. I am a fan of opi polish, however this bottle seemed very watered down and loose.",0
"Good packaging, shipment arrived on time. The product itself was mediocre. For a product made specifically for blonde hair it had no moisturizing components. Made my hair dry and tangled.",0
"very light on your skin, not greasy at all",1
I ordered the gray and found it to be to light for me.,0
"I was excited for this because it had great reviews but really does not work how I want it/thought it would be. It makes me look super oily. Even when I diluted with water (I put it in a different spray bottle), it still gives me the same problem. This might work for real dry skin? I have normal skin so maybe thats why. I do enjoy the scent of roses though!",0
My daughter like this product because doesn't left a dry skin after washing her face.,1
Smells terrible but works pretty good. Not good enough for the money it costs however.,0
Came without a lid so not impressed,0
"Great toner that keeps my face from breaking out post wash. It's a wonderful product, doesn't sting, and keeps those pores toned.",1
"This is a more day time fresh out of the shower scent in my opinion. It reminds me of a scent from either the 70's or 80's that i remember smelling as a kid. Its very patient and strong smelling. I'm not exactly sure which note is the standout that i small the most but it has a powdery smell. It could be the cardamom which naturally is very strong.

I found the notes online and they are:
Top Notes:
Ginger, Bergamot, Cardamom, Cinnamon
Heart Notes:
Sage, Apple, Heliotrope
Base Notes:
Sandalwood, Teak, Amber, Tonka, Musk

This cologne lasts almost all day and again its more of a light gentle scent not a strong woodsy or spicy manly scent. It kind of reminds me of something Calvin Klein would put out where it can be a unisex scent. That's just my opinion.

You may want to go to a store and try the tester on this one first because when i first sprayed it on it was ok but then as the day went on it started giving me a slight headache because of one of the notes became the dominant one. I find myself liking it but then not liking it. Its strange or maybe i'm strange. lol. The shape of the bottle is to me like a long cut in half circle wedge. Its a large bottle too so it will last you long especially that this is more patient stuff.",1
"Have been using this product for a few years now, really love this product, being that it has a tint to I don't have to wear foundation.",1
the product is good because it affords extra protection.  The product should be offered in a waterproof form.,1
"I am very pale and with other foundations I need to apply so much to get even coverage, and the result is that my whole face looks like a pair of old khakis.  With Jane Iredale, it just looks like my own skin but covers up any blemishes.  I have bought it again and again, especially now that I found that it is cheaper on Amazon than at the skincare store.  There is also a ""setting spray"" which is supposed to make the powder look more natural.  I used it and liked it, but once I ran out I never bought more and I haven't noticed any great difference.  Jane Iredale is the best!  You will still look like yourself, but better!",1
one of the best conditioning treatments for your hair,1
"Be careful, go slow, and you will get a shave that is at least the equivalent of an electric razor.",1
"My hair thinned quite a bit due to age and chemo.  I use the optimizer to enhance my hairline.  The tool works great with the toppik to give a natural hairline. The reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 has more to do with applying toppik to the hairline.  If you sweat or get stuck out in the rain, the toppik will run a little and its very easy to wipe it (drag it) onto the forehead.",1
It's a good blower! . they shouldn't increase the price!. they lost  3 sales for my side!. I was recommending this blow dryer to my friends! but they don't want to pay more than I paid.,1
"The inside scraper that clears the excess mascara off the brush before use has come out three times. It's been a bit frustrating especially since the mascara isn't cheap.
And, there is flaking plus some minimal clumping...",0
"I just received this a few days ago. I initially tried this product at Sephora and it felt and smelled a lot differently. There seems to be very little in the tube and it smells like a chemical. Also it does very little if anything for my skin, does not minimize wrinkles or pores; and mine look the same with or without this cream. I have tried to like it but it just does not do what it claims. Maybe if you are young and have flawless skin already you will like this but for someone with mature skin it does very little as it claims it should. Also for the amount you get in the tube and lack of results the price is very high and I will not be buying this again.",0
Does not stay on very long.  Disappointing.,0

I don't remember the brand or product name so I haven't been able to find it since. I have been looking for something similar ever since.

This ICELAND illuminator is exactly what I have been searching for. You only need to use the tiniest little bit of this stuff because a little goes a long way. I dab a little on my pinky finger and put little dots of this under my eyes. Then I use my pinky finger to smooth it under my eyes very gently so as to not pull or stretch the delicate skin under my eyes.

Illuminator helps reflect the light under my  eyes so they appear brighter and less tired. When I am doing a full face of makeup I put the liquid foundation on first, then illuminator, then an ever so light dusting of powder just so it sets. I usually do not wear illuminator if I am using a pressed compact alone, but I guess it could work the same way as when using the liquid.

In the video I tried so show how it gives a little shimmer when the light hit where I put it on the back of my hand. I hope it's clear enough in the video. You can definitely tell in person.",1
Broke me out.,0
"what I liked most....hmmn  NOTHING
did nothing for my eye area.  better results with olay (cheap)",0
This product worked for the 1st month then lost any power it had.  I've charged it and...nothing.  Of course it falls just out of the return window so I'm out of luck.,0
Excellent.  Goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly.,1
"This product was so thick, I had to throw it away.  Very unhappy.  I thought I would save some money, but now I have to buy it again",0
"Great Razor. I'd highly recommend it. It's much better quality than the typical plastic razors. I bought it for it's sustainability, but it truly is a closer, longer lasting shave with no left behind stubble. My husband has loved his the past couple years and now it's my turn. Great for legs and armpits as well ladies! Zero issues so far with either cuts or razor burn.",1
It does not straighten my hair completely the ends are horrible.  Please do not buy this item. :-(,0
"My title says it all, as soon as I switched to the T3 showerhead, there was no pressure in my shower anymore, the water jet turned into a super weak water stream... I checked if there was any leak at the base of the showerhead, there was none, the water just loses its pressure and speed as it goes through the showerhead. And it would also slow down my water temperature changes, so it would always be either too hot or too cold.

Regarding the ""shiny/frizz-free"" results, I really noticed no difference, yes, the water tastes better, big deal LOL. Plus the showerhead does not filter the fluoride contained in tap water, which is the worst contaminant today.

I've used it for 3 months, and went back to my old showerhead today. DON'T BUY IT!",0
really good for aging sensitive eyes,1
"Did not heat as I expected, and very heavy.",0
received a damaged item,0
I don't care for the lemon sage but its a good product.,1
Best curling iron ive ever used!  Only takes 5-10 mins to do hair.  Highly recommend!,1
"I have fair, combination skin and bought this looking for a non-greasy physical sunblock for the face for my family.  It has to be shaken very well before application, as it will otherwise separate.  Sadly, however, we all burned using this product.  (I've been using sunscreen daily for over 20 years and am well-versed with how to apply sunscreen and the frequency needed for reapplication.)  Despite the fact that it is cosmetically elegant, blending in nicely with almost no smell and very little white sheen, I will not repurchase and cannot recommend as it doesn't do its job to protect skin from burning. I am going back to my long-time favorite Elta MD products.",0
"The product is good, but didn't work for me.  I returned and still have not received the return credit.",0
Clogs your skin feels extremely heavy on your beard.,0
"Way darker than expected, could not use",0
"Great cologne , smells clean and fresh. Just what I was wanting in a cologne . Thanks",1
"First what all all the chemicals in this stuff, I was just shopping and figured most higher end brands don't add all that unnecessary stuff saw the main ingredients and figured it was good to go. This stuff is toxic and cheap. The scent was like something from the dollar store and the qauilty was just bad. For this price it makes no sense.",0
"Does the job filling in those thin spots.  But unless you want to spend a small fortune no one mistake you for a hair model,  beware this stuff is messy, goes everywhere, though mostly on your head.  The puff applicator helps but it's slow and not as effective as shaking.  Of course I'm speaking about the hair, this is the spray which does the job but gives you helmet head quickly if not careful.",1
Refreshing way to apply toner before moisturizer.  Waiting for it to dry 3 minutes just adds another step to the make up routine but if that does not bother you the product is fine. I leave a bottle in my guest bathroom for a cool down spritz for my lady friends who have their own personal summer. Keeping skin healthy and hydrated year round is a challenge and this spray seems to help.,1
"This lipstick is not what I hoped for.  The color is way too strong/bright, it looks garish. I tend too like more natural nudes. I do like the scent, but even if I just lightly blot this on it goes on way to red.",0
Lots of goodies that I would have never tried otherwise. Loved them all.,1
"Ive had this exact same model curling iron for a few years and I love it. The hinge finally gave out so I replaced. This new one just didn't quite feel the same. I compared the models as well as the branding but found no differences. But, it is definitely lighter, noticeably so, and my hair doesnt really glide through it like the original one. Most importantly, even with heat almost maxed, it barely put a wave in my hair :(

The good news is it came with two replacement hinges so I was able to replace the broken one on my original curling iron and Im back in business!",0
"I love this product. My dermatologist recommended and I could not be happier, even though I was very skeptical first. I have been using it over 3 years now and will not change ever.... well unless it stops working ;-)) I was just out of States for 6 months and was sure I can buy it in Europe or Asia, but to my surprise this specific product was nowhere to be found, so I bought in States and my friend brought it over. I just had another friend of mine test it for 3 days and now I am buying again one for me and one for her. Love it!!!!!",1
My favorite sunscreen! Feels like you're wearing nothing. Can also use on face although I mainly use on my body.,1
Got this for my fianc who has super sensitive skin. He was surprised that this actually made a difference in keeping skin irritation at bay while shaving instead of regular grocery store stuff. Definitely worth the $$$!,1
"I had an allergic reaction to this line of products.  If you have sensitive skin, you may want to shy away from this line.  They smell really nice so it was a shame that I had a reaction. :(",0
"I purchased two of this product in the past and didn't have any issue. This purchase was very disappointing. It didn't come in original packaging, box was almost falling apart and was very disgusted to see some hair in the brush.",0
Unfortunately this product did nothing for my skin. I notice no difference at all and have religiously used it morning and night for 3 weeks now. There are better products out there.,0
I only chose the 4 stars because I haven't used it that much yet.  I do love the feel. I love all my Ouidad products.  You have to use them a few times to get the full affect.,1
"Touts itself to be an antioxidant sunscreen, but the only 2 ""active"" ingredients listed are the usual sunscreen things. How it's supposed to be antioxidant is beyond me. Would not buy again.",0
"This toothpaste is odd at first, but it leaves your breath with a beautiful floral scent for hours after brushing.",1
This product was either a knock off or very old. It was awful! Buyer beware!,0
"I use this along with the orange soap cleanser & the glycolic toner.  My skin looks & feels pretty great, definitely smooth & never dry using these products, though I'm not sure why there needs to be oil-peanut oil no less, in this product?! I apply liquid makeup with a brush after the Honey Moisturizer, and my makeup lasts most of the day.  I have mild rosacea, some sensitivities, early 40's, used to have blackheads on nose, and oily prone T-zone.  My favorite product is the toner, because I feel like it does the most, but I like this moisturizer.  And it lasts forever- a little goes a long way.  I will likely try other Badescu products.",1
"I had read a bit about this candle product from Baxter of Cali before buying bec it is a pricey one. Candles over $50 (small size candles) should not only have great scents but also be able to fill a space pleasantly without being overwhelming. This scent White Wood No. 3 surely does not overwhelm. It completely underwhelms and almost gives off NO scent at all. Bottom line very disappointing for such an expensive candle.
I contacted the company explained my concern and they said they would take it back but I would have to pay for shipping it back..almost $10 for those of us NOT in the shipping business. Felt that was too expensive and with no sense (no pun intended) that a replacement would be any better, I just put it away for use when the lights go out.",0
Great skin treatment,1
"This product is too expensive for what you receive.  In fact, I see little difference from a $10 bottle of conditioner.  Sure, this is marketed as a glaze, has a luxurious scent, the bottle is really cool and expensive looking.  But when it comes down to it, you are getting less than 6 ounces of this product.  The 'use once a week' instructions seem more like a marketing gimmick to justify the cost.

As far as conditioner goes though, it is a great product (if you ignore the price tag).  There are no parabens, sulfates, or sodium chloride listed in the ingredients.  But like the $10 bottle of conditioner, it's major ingredients are water, glycerin, and dimethicone.  Dimethicone is an inexpensive silicon-based polymer used as a lubricant and conditioning agent - the same chemical that is in your standard over the counter product.

So it's marketing.  Do you light your cigars with $100 bills while your boots are propped up on your mahogany executive desk?  Then you may like to go for this stuff.  It looks expensive, smells expensive, is expensive, and will condition your hair just like the drugstore brand.",0
"I wear this product everyday, in place of make-up. It has enough color for me. I like the amount of moisturizer and sunscreen in it.
I have not used this product very long, maybe a month, but I like it, so far.",1
"I purchased this product from Amazon and it arrived in January 2017.  I have loved the BaBylissPro brand but the product has only lasted one year. It turns off and on during use and is not a reliable flat iron.  I have ordered another one from Amazon to be delivered today at full price and hope it does not disappoint.  If so, Ill have to order elsewhere.",0
"I purchased the pink taupe, the color is great and it goes on nice. The downside is that this lipstick does NOT stay on very long. I've been a dedicated purchaser of Covergirl Outlast Lipstick for many years, but wanted to try something new. This just doesn't compare to the staying power of my drugstore brand.",0
"When I purchased this product it was quickly shipped to me before the following week and I had paid for the standard 5 business days shipment. I love the colors on the palette, they're long lasting and have really good pigmentation! Great service and palette itself!",1
There are two reviews that say that this shampoo is sulfate free but it DOES have sulfates in it.,0
"Great product, a little goes a long way and your hair feels amazing, soft and shiny!",1
Needs strong acetone to fully remove. Almost clear,1
I love this. I also ordered Living Proof Overnight Hair Mask but I like this one more. I put it on at night and wake up with my hair so smooth.,1
"The polish I received looks nothing like the one shown for sale. It looks more similar to Essie's ""Play Date."" This was also the first time I've purchased nail polish online. Lesson learned: stick to purchasing polish in person.",0
Actually made my situation worse because it turned my pimples into terrible scabs that scarred.,0
Love Borghese products.  They are very easy to apply and long lasting.  I have used a number of them for years.,1
"I had great hopes for this line- bought full system and its awful! Not only did it not volumize or improve the thickness/length or growth of my hair, but its sticky/gross feeling, was difficult to comb through n work with and made my hair feel dirty. I had to wash it out couple hours after I applied. Dont buy this!",0
"I have been using product for a long time b/c it's really long lasting and very lightly covered on my skin.
However, this seller sent me wrong item.
Originally, I ordered one lavender ($26.99) and one rose silk($29.99).
But what I've got from this seller is two lavender ones, which is cheaper than rose silk.
And when I ask exchange, the seller emailed me he would send me rose silk.
But I haven't got any rose silk for about 2 weeks. When I contacted the seller again, he said there is no stock so I need to wait until he gets the product but he doesn't mention when exactly I can get.
It's so frustrating to wait and wait so I asked him ""just give me the balance $3 (rose silk cost - lavender silk powder)
But I haven't got any penny from him.",0
I have used CHI silk infusion 6 ounce for over 10 years.  The contents & color are thick & yellowish.  I apply it to my hair after each shampoo. It always leave a soft & silky feeling.  This is the first time I ever bought the 12 ounces.  Texture is completely different; content & color is white & run loose like water.  It does not feel silky at all but oily after applying.,0
"I love all Vichy Products, this one is great for light moisture and not a heavy feeling. If you use a primer under make-up you can use this instead and a light setting spray.",1
"Sorry, but this product is not working for me after using for 2 months",0
I have thin hair.  I had hoped for volume but what I got was flat hair!  I've used Oribe products before and have been very happy.  This one just didn't work for me.,0
As I said...it's a piece of junk.  Great idea - too bad.  Do not buy this!,0
This smells like old man mixed with a hipster bar.  i didn't know if I would start curling my mustache and wearing skinny jeans or sit in the corner and tell old war stories while chewing on a splintered toothpick.  This is honestly not a good smell by any means of the imagination.  THINK WHITE DIAMONDS for MEN,0
To me this just seems like a light hair spray. I don't notice my hair feeling or looking any thicker than it does with normal hair spray and I'm just taking the word of Arrojo that it is protecting my hair from heat styling (as is the case with any of these products).,0
This product did not work at all.  My daughter and I each had a tube and used it faithfully for one month resulting in no noticeable improvement.,0
the best and only thing working for acne,1
"It is a lot smaller than I expected, so that was very disappointing.",0
I am so very disappointed! I wish I could return it! Do yourself a favour and go to a department store and bye the original one! Do not waste your money on this fake product!,0
Really stinky.  Does not work on my hair - at all.  What a rip off.,0
Only got to use once and it stopped working didn't save the box so Im out money very disappointed,0
"This is the most expensive candle I've ever had and I'm somewhat surprised to find that it is worth the money. The wax is very pure and burns cleanly and slowly. The scent used to be called satsuma proseco and that is a good description. Light floral notes that reminds you of a fine champagne.

It comes in a beautiful gift box that is designed to also work as a stand however mine was severely tilted. No matter, the candle jar is beautiful and doesn't need the stand.",1
This stuff works well just like it says and it has an nice eucalyptus smell to it as well.  Word 21.,1
Best conditioner ever. makes my hair so smooth and a little goes a long way!,1
Does the job and was recommended by my dermatologist .,1
Very awkward to use. . . easy to burn self.,0
"I am usually a super huge fan of Jack Black products. This product works. It smells like a cross between green tea and a nice upscale spa. It also keeps me relatively dry. The reason I gave it two stars is that baby powder actually keeps me drier longer. So given the cost differential, I am going to pass on this particular Jack Black product.",0
"The product itself is fine, but the pump is crap. I shouldn't have to change clothes after putting on makeup because foundation sprays EVERYWHERE. Not worth the money,",0
"Best facewash ever!
I usually spend semi sparingly but this one works SO WELL for my acne probe skin that I shell it out, well with it.
Would recommend and will buy again.
Super good, worth a try in combo with a moisturizer and witch hazel, and rosehip seed oil.
Good luck!",1
I'm not impressed.  I regret this purchase.  The ceramic one I had before this was 100x better! BOOOOOOOOO,0
It was okay. I thought you could spend the credit on any luxury beauty item but it wasn't only on brands featured in the box.,0
"This is a Hot Tools curling iron with several heat control options. It has a small round turn dial on the side of the handle that allows you to select the exact heating temperature (up to 428 degrees) you would like to use for styling your hair. There is a power switch separate from the heat control which allows you to leave the temperature set where you want it all the time. The barrel is 1-1/4"" round and makes large beautiful curls.

The cord is long (extra long!) and is easy to use in areas that are far from an outlet. The end where the cord meets the curling iron swivels creating an easy tangle-free operation.",1
I bought this in August and it has already stopped working. I thought I was buying a better brand of hairdryer after doing some research. Extremely unhappy since I'm unable return it due to the 30 day return policy.,0
The item on time and as expected. The price was even lower than Prime which was admirable. Good job.,1
"allergic reaction. My eyes was red, and I had double vision. Waste of money",0
Pretty colour but felt like sandpaper on lips.,0
"Not sure about it.  It smells the same and looks the same but packaging is different.  I can't find anywhere that states Paul Mitchell changed the color of the top from grey to black, as seen in the pictures I included.  It makes me uneasy to try it.  If it doesn't come looking like the original I won't even try it.  To scared ",0
"Don't waste your money not as good as original Obagi nu-derm wash
Did not exfoliate or clean my face",0
My husband love this stuff and it was cheaper buying it this way,1
This is the clumpiest Shellac polish I've ever used.  It's very difficult to get the polish even and smooth.,0
Wonderful toner and so worth it. Stopped using for awhile.  Immediate difference as soon as I began using it again.,1
"works well, did not really see results after first treatment even with the malibu but keep with it and you see results.",1
I love onesta. But I could tell this wasn't legitimate product. It smelled different than my salon purchased and it lathered more. Just buy it from the salon or don't bother.,0
"light and easy to use, it firms with visible results after a few applications. I will continue to use every other night, paired with other night cream. Good buy.",1
Such a shame that this product has stopped working after only using it myself once! I bought it when my sister was visiting from the UK as she said she loved hers and she used it a few times while she was staying. I went to use it again last week and the brush no longer turns! Crazy as its really only had about 6 uses! Cant contact the seller thru my order now so hoping they will see this review and help me out.,0
Still the best you can buy!,1
"I liked the colors and read many good reviews so decided ordered even though price were higher than Other popular brand(Essie,OPI). Unfortunately,I was so disappointed that I put two coats and top coat just like I always do but second day, I already tipping off !  I was shocked...
I used twice but not anymore...",0
Maybe I need a tutorial but this stuff is very messy going on.,0
"Made my hair SUPER fizzy.
My hair is very thick, wavy, and very long.
I'm sticking with my argan oil routine.",0
"I have thick, medium, curly hair and sometimes I want it smoothed out and just soft waves, but I don't do a very good job on my own with a round brush & blow dryer and don't like to take the time (or endure the damage) to get it super sleek with a flat iron.  Hence, the search for a new tool that might not get it hairdresser perfect, but certainly much closer than the fuzzy shrubhead I ended up with on humid days trying to do it myself.

Behold, the Babyliss rotating hot air brush.  I've only used it once thus far, and it took a few minutes to get the hang of it, but once I did, baby, I was rolling!  My hair is soft, smooth, nice big waves, and no sore shoulders or weirdly dried pieces in the middle of the back of my head.

 I let my hair air dry until it was damp and the curls had started springing up all over. I made sure to use a heat protector spray.  The real trick for doing this well is to spin-dry the hair in small sections for good control and to keep the brush from spinning up to the scalp.  This is annoying but doesn't hurt.  The brush can spin in either direction, and when I spun up too much hair, I just hit the button for the opposite direction and all was good again.

I feel like this has been a good investment.  I won't use it every day, I'm sure, because I like to change things up a lot, but it certainly makes this particular look a lot easier and will pay for itself vs. a salon blow-dry in just a couple of uses.",1
My favorite nude color polish.,1
"I bought this as a gift for my sister in law. The colors are very ""safe"", high quality and easy to use. This is a classy gift that can be appreciated by beginners and makeup enthusiasts.",1
I don't know how much I like this eyeliner yet. It was kind of hard to apply. I had to go over it twice at least to really make it opaque. But once you apply it and let it set for a bit it pretty much won't budge all day!,1
Works great as soon as i put it on but does not last in humid environment.,1
ruins the polish it goes ....and Amazon would not let me return it,0
Love this stuff so far. Smells incredible. It doesn't seem to last long though. I was also a bit disappointed that the bottle wasn't in any kind of packaging. Just in a box with one piece of packing paper so the cap cracked and about 1/6 of the bottle leaked into the box. The box smells good!!,1
"1 WEEK after using it, it dried up maybe it was from who I got the product from but it sucks. I am super dissapointed because it wasn't cheap eyeliner. Dried up after 1 week L'Oreal is much better and MAYBELINE. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU JUST NEED IT FOR A FEW DAYS.",0
Absolutely horrible - had to throw it out. It had separated and couldn't be remixed. Will not buy from here again.,0
Had a better foot creams - not one of my favorites...,0
It made my face burn from the minute I put it on and long after I finally washed it off.,0
"Read about this in a magazine and one of the reviews said it smelled like orange and cedar....mine smells more like pinesol or ajax dishsoap not nice at all, also very little foaming action and oil doesn't really stay/hydrate well.....buy eucerin shower oil - half the price and way better!",0
"When I bought it, I thought it was a cleaner that I could use everyday. I was wrong. You can use it once or twice a week. Even my skin type is oil, this cleaner makes my face too dry. Not good.",0
Once dry heats up it falls off the nozzle.  Same experience I've had in the past with other dryers.,0
Works great!!!!,1
great stuff... I order it for my wife and she loves it... her hair looks fantastic... i wanted to include a photo but she wouldn't let me,1
"I love this stuff,  work in a bakery with a commercial oven and if would melt my mascara and make my eyelashes stick together or get on my brow bone, this stuff handles the heat fine and it washes off really easy in the shower.",1
"This is not inexpensive, but it's so nice to see a moisturizing product that men in my house will actually use, that it's worth it.

The product got off to a bad start right out of the box. It smelled vile. However, that was, oddly, from the Amazon shipping or something it had been stored near in the warehouse. Opening the tube, the white liqud, a bit more flowing than toothpaste, squeezed out easily and with no unpleasant fragrance (very little scent at all that I could tell. This was good!)

It made a positive impression from ""first contact"" and I heard comments like, ""It goes on very well"", ""feels good"", and ""I like it"". One thing that impressed me was that, as promised, there was no shininess or greasiness to the skin. It really does go on with a matte finish. No one would know you had used a moisturizer at all--while getting all the benefits of one.  Good product. If not for the price being high, it would be 5 stars. But, at least you do get what you pay for.",1
Left my hair stuck together and looking thinner than ever.,0
love this pencil. goes on like silk and stays put! a must in my makeup arsenal.,1
It smells cheap..,1
love it,1
Horriblr this perfume is a knock off not the real thing.,0
This has an intense smell but totally does a great job!,1
"This comb is attractive and has a nice weight and shape to it.  Only you can decide if it's worth the price over a drugstore comb, but the main differences are (1) weight (2) how finely rounded the edges are.

The comb feels substantial and it's size makes it easy to grip.  Any comb will probably do the job of getting out tangles, but the tines of this comb feel smoother on the scalp and has a nicer weight to it than comparably-sized combs that are less expensive.

The acetate material will become slightly cloudy from combing action (hair being pulled along the frame will cause fine scratches that remove some of the out-of-the-box shine), but it doesn't affect the generally attractive tortoiseshell appearance.

Another thing to note is that I have owned a similar comb by a British company (Kent Brushes), and cellulose acetate is no more durable (in fact, it may even be more brittle) than harder plastics.

Overall, I recommend this comb, but I'm sure it's worth the sticker price.

Edited to add: I've had this comb for over a year and it still looks and works great.  Prefer it to other combs I've had and thus for durability I'm upgrading it to 5 stars (instead of the 4 stars in my original review).",1
"The first time I used this the polish went on perfectly smooth, no lumps.  The second time I used it the color went on all lumpy and gloppy...I hated it so much I took the polish off right then and redid my nails cuz I thought I had done something wrong.  Nope, came out all lumpy & gloppy again.  I read some other reviews where this happened to other people.  I threw the bottle out then.  So I got one good manicure out of it.  Pretty expensive manicure!",0
just as good as the old one,1
My skin did not seem to like it,0
Doesn't work that well and smells awful.,0
"I think the only thing holding this back is that it's a high price for a single use sheet. You also don't see an immediate difference except with hydration (but there's a separate mask for that) I think if you go into this looking for fixing sagging aging skin you're going to be super disappointed. I feel like you need to use this multiple times to notice a difference, and at $10 a mask, you can see where this gets super pricey. I did give it 4 stars though because I love the brand and it was a great splurge for a DIY spa day filled with under eye masks, face masks, foot exfoliators and of course this hand mask. It was a great splurge that I would do once a month or so, but to notice a difference right away, I feel like you will be disappointed.

This would also be a great hand mask every so often in the winter months when it's super dry out.  My favorite from this brand is the hydrating hand mask because it does exactly what it says.",1
"feel normally, it is small.",1
Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.  You get a nice sample - about two weeks worth.  Love the sampling program!,1
works better with soap but it's ok with just water,0
"For this price this definitely disappointed. For me and my partner we saw no difference. To be fair I received just the tube without any instructions and we sort of had to guess how to use it. It dries fast, so that the big clue its a mask, but it definitely comes out more like a heavy cream. We tried leaving it on for 2 minutes and 5 minutes and 10 minutes and used it probably 5 times a piece over a two week period. I have drier skin, my partner has more oily/acne prone skin and neither of saw any difference, and certainly not any difference that would warrant the price and waiting 2-10 minutes for it to kick in.",0
"I am not easily impressed but this is really a great thickening duo! I worried it would take alot of trial and error to find a new thickening shampoo and conditioner when I could not find my old favorite of many years anymore. Based on reviews I tried this. Ever since the very first use of this product, and every day since, my hair is much lighter, fuller, and bouncier. I have alot of extrememly thin hair that is long (mid-back). I get body wave perms for body and curl; otherwise I'd have stick straight flyaway hair. My current perm is 8 months old and after using this product my hair looks like I got a new perm! I don't even want to tie it back it looks so nice. The ""essential oil"" smell is also wonderful but not girly. Very happy with this purchase. Will definitely buy again if results continue this way!",1
Imitation product. Go to Bioelements website to purchase the real deal!,0
My wife don't like the cool mist technology. Her hair was greasy after the use..but she used on the fresh washed hair. I guess just this technology not working on her hair..:/,0
"I have used this cream for over a week and love the way it absorbs into the skin, the light feel of it, and very faint scent.  So far I haven't seen dramatic results - but I do think it might be brightening up my hands..  I'll keep trying - and might even buy another tube to give it a fair chance.",1
Definitely took away the scalp itch and dandruff.  Leaves scalp cool and tingly.,1
horrible!!! Don't like the fragrance at all. I don't know what this perfume smells like,0
It works into a nice lather and a single drop does the whole shave! It has a subtle scent that the wife likes!!  It's very soothing when brushed on!,1
Really like this.,1
Did not notice any decrease in hair.,0
Used less than 5 times and the on/off switch broke.  Now I have to plug/unplug each use.  No automatic shut off.,0
Worked great for a year.  Then the bonnet stretched so that the hose would not say in.  I don't  believe I will try a Hot Tools product again the future.,0
"smells very chemical-y after 4 hours if not washed off soon. also has a VERY slight green-orange tint. other than that, its pretty good.",1
i have used this same mascara in the past and really loved it  this product is very dry as if it is outdated and has been warehoused to long prior to being shipped to me  I am so disappointed and will think twice prior to ordering cosmetics from this web site,0
"This did not work well on my fine shiny hair (not a lot of texture).  I turned the heat setting all the way up, but it didn't seem to get hot enough.  It also caught and pulled hair out during the curling process.  I'm going to try the hot tools 1181 and see if it's any better.",0
"Fantastic product for a great price, fast shipping too!",1
"I bought this predicated on the outstanding reviews plus its description of no irritation. Unfortunately, this causes me discomfort and irritation.  After application, my skin is really dry, itchy, and red. My skin is flaking off the same way it does after recovering from a bad sunburn. I keep applying hoping that my skin just needs to get used to it, however this is not the case.",0
I wish I could return this.  It doesn't work well.,0
Love it!,1
When you buy quality you never regret it. I'm a tool guy and I'm not afraid to buy expensive quality tools if I use them a lot. A hair dryer is my wife's tool and she uses it every day so I thought I'd get her a good one. She was not disappointed.,1
"I love most of the Mario Badescu line, however, after applying a small amount in the morning, it still isn't absorbed by the evening. Perhaps I will try it as an overnight eye cream. Read a real simple review it is the best eye cream available, but it didn't work for my skin.",0
"Convenient toner as you don't need separate cotton balls to apply toner, but is on the pricey side. May be cheaper to get regular toner and use something to apply with.",1
Broke out.,0
Bought this September 2013. Used it a few times right after purchasing but really didn't start using it regularly until the past month. Now it doesn't work at all. This definitely did not get regular enough use to already be not working. Pretty disappointed and now too late to return. Will be searching for another brand for my next one.,0
"I like the color, but this feels more like a silver than a peal color.  Very nice and high quality, not a gaudy color by any means, would likely purchase again, just not intending to get a white color.",1
Perfect size and was a great price compared to the salon!,1
"The nozzle falls off every time I use it regardless of how tightly I fit it on the dryer.  It sounds and acts weak, it takes far more time to dry my hair than any other dryer I have ever owned.  I am baffled at the $85.00 price.  Save your money, buy something else, anything else.",0
Good for my sensitive skin.  Does not irritate at all.  I like it.,1
"This mineral powder base is wonderful for someone with dry skin.  It really covers nicely without looking cakey. I leaves a silky sheen as if the face glows. However, I can not give it five stars, because it does not work for women with combo or oily skin.  Even on a dry winter day, with my T-zones get oily and this powder then causes break-outs. All in all, Jane Iredale's products are luxurious but for oily or combination skin tones, I would recommend Lauren Hutton's Aqua Elements.",1
bottle came half open The pump didn't work. Used it a couple times then threw it away. I didn't like the residue it left on my hands either. It did smell good though.,0
"I like this product as it leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable.  Doesn't look greasy once on hair.  Will order more when running low.  Please don't discontinue it.",1
"I originally bought this from my dermatologist, and shared it with my daughter.  She loved it so much that I bought this tube for her (and at a much better price)!",1
"I was looking for an antiperspirant that didn't contain aluminum and based on the reviews this looked great. It may just be my body chemistry but I found this deodorant very uncomfortable. I tried it for a day and I never really felt like it dried all the way, By the end of the day my skin was irritated. I washed it off and have not used it since.  I don't know if they have smaller sizes but if you are interested I would see if there is a sample to try first.",0
The only reason that I docked a star is due to the fact it tends to crack easily. Love the coverage and ease of application.,1
"Best price around, beats the mall.",1
I had to return this item because it did NOT curl my hair at all. It was terrible...  This was the first item I have ever had to return and Amazon made it very easy.,0
Emphasizes all the fine lines around my eyes.,0
Don't order this. Mine stopped working and doesn't heat up or show signs of life after just five weeks of use. There is no return or replacement policy outside of 30 days. Don't waste your money on this faulty iron.,0
This  was a good dryer and I really liked using it but it broke after 6 months!!!! Don't waste your money.,0
I bought 2 bottle already. and will stick to it for a long time:),1
"Doesnt stay on
Very disappointed",0
too opaque,0
"Helps smooth lips, but doesn't really moisturize them. Still a great item though.",1
"Skip on this. Doesn't really lather, doesn't smell like what I was hoping it would, and doesn't feel like it really gets my hair clean. Too expensive!",0
It is not the opi brand . The product is very watery. When you look at the back the label is definitely a forgery. So surprising Amazon sells this product,0
"I've used this product for years and it does a great job hiding thinning hair.  The manufacturer makes a claim that it's not messy and won't come off....not true.  Be prepared to clean your bathroom and countertops after every use and don't wear anything light when applying it.  Also, it WILL come off on your hands if you scratch your head.  That said, I couldn't live without it and i'm still a daily user...no one can tell my hair is thinning.  Tip:  if you want to create a ""part"" use a pipe cleaner to cover the area of the part and then shake on the Toppik lightly.",1
"So after reading  reviews of this product, I decided to buy it but was very disappointed that IT MADE MY EYES BURN even after i washed my face. Will return it. Complete AVOID",0
"Not sure how it smells, rather rancid.",0
Only liked one of the dark colors,0
Great product although if you order this off of of the Mario badescu sight the liquid is much darker .... so not sure if this is the real thing .,1
"This is just like any other dryer and expensive. I have a 1850 watt at home which is more powerful than this 2000 watt. I looked for a while for a more expensive/better hair dryer than then one I have at home, so disappointed. Will probably have to spend a little more and buy one from the salon.  I have fine, curly hair and this hair dryer did not provide me w/the power I was looking for. The high setting is more like a low setting. Not sure if maybe I got a defective one?",0
Wife loves this perfume!,1
Creases like crazy!,0
My favorite after 50 years of mascara choices!,1
These hotrollers don't heat up like they're supposed to. Some get hot some don't. I was very very disappointed with them.,0
Solid product. I like the fact that it is non greasy. Wish it was a bit lighter in feel when applying (not as heavy/tacky) but overall it works as expected.,1
"After going through chemo, I had some bald spots because I used cold caps to keep most of my hair in. This covered up perfectly so I could go around with no wig. No one could even tell!",1
"Using 2-3 time a week to avoid over saturation, as recommended by hair care specialist, there seems to be a marked increase in the body of my hair.",1
Fragrance is fantastic although does not last.  Apply a metric s*** ton and non existent by noon.,0
I don't like that this was delivered with tape keeping the lid on and no sealer on the tube when I opened it.  It makes me think the ingredients could have been tampered with!,0
"Worked very well in the beginning.
Then it stopped . Hope it will regain its ability to restore hair growth.",1
Iam a hairdresser and was looking for my first titanium flat iron now this one does work better than ur regular flat iron better for ur hair ect but..... It is only titanium surface not titanium plates so if ur wanting this for keratin blowouts like I was its not going to work but I will use it at home for myself and it works great way better than my $100 chi. Would recommend for at home use,1
Good product but not worth an 18$ price increase! There are some better options out there...Peter Thomas Roth...Obagi...keep looking...it is a heavier moisturizer...,0
This product didn't work a waste of money I wouldn't ever buy it again. I thought that it would but damage my hair even more,0
"Ew The product came with a crusty lid. Does it mean it was opened before, or the product isn't new or iyd kfake",0
Does not have much staying power.,0
"This brand was recommended to me by a professional clinician when I got a facial.  I have noticeable dark, slightly puffy circles under my eyes and was hoping this would help.  The stuff does moisturize and makes them look a bit better immediately after use.  However, the effect doesn't last long; certainly there hasn't been any noticeable lasting improvement over the course of 2 weeks.  What drops this from a 'meh '3 stars to 2, however, is that this stuff burns if it gets in your eyes!  Yes, an eye cream that hurts eyes.  I didn't realize it at first, but any sweat or other moisture on your face after this stuff has been applied will cause any residual IS eye ccomplex to run and drip into the eyes.  After this happened while I was driving (making my eyes burn and water so badly I had to pull over until they felt better), I decided it wasn't worth it.  Will be trying other products and not buying this again.",0
My favorite !,1
This is completely not worth it. It does not work as well as a CHI and it burns your hair at the setting of 340 degrees.,0
"The mascara looks great and is actually not too difficult to apply.  The brush is rather big, so be forewarned.  The main issue is that this volumizing mascara is actually inferior to Bare Minerals volumizing mascara.

All being said, it does look good.  Hence the four star review.",1
Great cologne!  I have loved the scent of this cologne for years.  It compliments my beautiful wife!,1
Colors darken. Does not last. Would not buy again,0
Great iron for big loose curls. Heats up fast. Come with replacement springs as well. Love this brand,1
Terrible and cheap!,0
"Good body soap, as a man it doesn't make me feel sticky with soap residue, good on skin and smells good also!",1
"JUNK!!  I bought this hair dryer and it didn't last even 90 days.  I'd expect more from Babyliss, and a $55 product.  It just stopped working in the middle of use and would not come back on.  I reset it and still nothing.  TOTAL WASTE OF GOOD MONEY.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!",0
"My wife is a huge fan of Ahava products and was excited for the opportunity to use this eye cream.  It has virtually no fragrance, and is thin and not greasy, all of which are good features for a product which will be used near the eyes.  It applies smoothly and has not irritated her eyes.  The directions state to apply the product in the morning and at night, but she has been using it for a little more than two weeks only at night, because she is reluctant to use it in the AM and apply makeup on top of it.  This cream seems to keep the skin around her eyes smooth and she is satisfied with it.",1
Love this color. Very plain and perfect for office days.,1
Good quality but needed several coats.  Not worth the price for me.,0
Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!! The colors are identical and the formula's great!,0
"I have only ordered this product from ""Jane Iredale authorized dealers"" in the past.  In my opinion, the quality is lacking when ordering from Amazon. The color and coverage are both different. It doesn't stay on my skin as long. It's also more expensive on Amazon. I will only buy from authorized dealers from now on.",0
"I was happy to receive this product from Jouer to review.  I am older now so I don't like to use a lot of makeup but that old saying, ""a little dab will do you,"" definitely helps. I applied a small amount to my face and I was surprised at how it added just the right color to give my face a brighter, healthier look. I then applied a small amount to my lips, both times it went on smooth, and easy. I used my finger to apply and that worked well.  I really liked how it looked on the lips. I think sometimes too much lipstick on an older woman doesn't look good, but this was just a touch of color that gave a healthy look. All in all a nice product, one that you can control the amount used. Simple and quick to apply, and will definitely give you a warm glow.",1
Only helpful while it's on. Looks nice and nails are instantly thicker and stronger. Will be buying more when this runs out,1
"I absolutely love the fresh fragrance of Lacoste!  I'm very picky when it comes to perfume, but this is just the BEST!",1
Blackberry and it give a beautiful shine.  Note if you wear everyday will dry lips.  I suggest to put lip medex on before.,1
"Different and cute!
Always OPI quality.",1
I will only wear jouer it makes my skin look flawless and beautiful!!! I love golden and pearl color!!,1
Had my 2nd session yesterday.  I do not see any difference.  As a matter of fact it appears that my unwanted hair is thickening??  It is completely painless for me.  I'll update this after 5 treatments.,0
Weak scent.,0
Is is NOT the same Obagi that you get at the doctors office!  This is Fx and it does not contain the same dose that the prescription version holds. It will not work the same.,0
"Massive lash growth and darkness since only a wk and half of using it. still waiting for the curl, but overall happy as it fills in my gaps from wearing false lashes too much.",1
"It makes my hair look, feel and smell very clean, however, it's difficult to apply it evenly. If it's not carefully blended, it leaves white powder on hair and scalp.",1
Not as good as the Peppercorn scent and a bit drying but a good product regardless.,1
"I'm sure this is doing the job, however when they say it turns color, they mean it! It is
a very dark orangey brown, actually turns my face a weird color also. Make up does
cover it up. Feels like water when you put it on, so between that and the color, I won't
buy it again. I like something that is more like a serum. Tried to contact them about
the dark  color and they did not reply.",0
Worked well in Germany,1
I loved this thing a lot when I first got it but a few months in and it does not hold a charge so I can not use it.  This is a lot of money for a face cleaning machine.  I have a larger size Clarisonic and it has lasted years and years - still going strong.  Not sure what happened with this style.  I am upset!,0
"Love this dryer! It's a bit heavy but the multiple settings are wonderful and it does dry speedily. I'll be curious to see how long it lasts for but so far, so good!!!",1
"Love this cologne!  One of my all time favorites and this was a great price, fast shipping and well packed.",1
My child had a terrible skin reaction.,0
Wanted these smaller sizes for travel case.,1
"I purchased this brush in store in Raleigh NC Crabtree Mall for $209.00, they told me the brush would last for 15 years, no sooner than a week the bristles started falling out and since then I have lost around 25% of the bristles.  Though it is much cheaper on Amazon than I paid in the Art Of the Shave store I would not recommend this product based on my personal experience.",0
I needed to change my review. After a few weeks of use- I have broken out worse than anything in my life. My skin has never been in this bad of shape in my life even in my teenage years! Bioelements and I clearly do not work well. I switched back to Dermalogica and instantly cleared up. Never switching again in my life.,0
"Always liked M&B, and this Orange&Bergamot scent is fantastic. However, the bottle is very small. Surprisingly, its made of PLASTIC! The spout is not well-made, and plastic is such a cheap way to package such an expensive product. Nice soap, but definitely not worth the $30 price tag. Not recommended.",0
"This makeup is a bit pricey but it goes on smoothe and looks very natural.  The brush that comes with it is pretty useless.  4 stats for the eyeshadow, minus one star for price and useless brush.",1
"I have had the Iredale line recommended to me by my aestetician because I was having allergic reactions even to Almay.  This is a lovely, rich feel gloss to apply.  I found the color to be more subtle than I expected but nice and natural in appearance.  I'm looking for a brick red statement color.  Enjoy!",1
Goes on smoothly and is as expected. Doesn't fade throughout the day. Great!,1
"To small, the 0.87 oz is better and more cost effective",0
"I wanted to love this product so badly, but unfortunately it was too drying for my dry skin. It clinged to dry patches on my face and caused itching.",0
"I don't like this polish. It was recommended at my local GBS in Ft Lauderdale. I bought the ""Casey"" color, have used it twice and cannot get the polish to go on smooth without bubbling.  If it was a cheaper polish I would not comment but I normally use OPI, Essie or Rimmel. OPI and Essie are always fine but even Rimmel at $5 in the drugstore is a much better polish than this one.",0
TERRIBLE!!!!!!! and hair STINKS like baby puke after the process is over and still smells after 5 days of washing it out every day.  I am throwing this out after one use.  Waste of my money.,0
"It's a bit dark for my skin tone, but I'll manage.  It's a bit hard to blend as well, and it was smaller than I expected.  Other than that, this bronzer was great.  It didn't have any orange or reddish color, just a nice natural tan.",1
"great curling iron, holds curls and doesn't make my hair smell burnt :)",1
"I like the fact that it has a light scent as I wear it at work and am aware that some people are allergic to heavy scents and can get excruciating migraines from being around someone wearing a heavy scent. I was surprised, though, that it didn't absorb as fast as indicated.  It took me a good full minute of rubbing for it to be absorbed.  The best comparison I can give is that it has the consistency of sunblock and takes approx. the same length of time for it to be absorbed. Unlike what others have stated in their reviews, I do find it a bit greasy--just a bit!",1
Love Jane Iredale products! Love this foundation. Purchase it regularly.,1
"I bought this in April 2014; it stopped working August 2015.  My wife and I are the only ones in the household, so it had light to moderate use.  In retrospect, it had been decreasing in generating airflow for a couple of months and then two weeks ago it started buzzing when turned on and then completely died.  Seems to be an expensive item to fail so quickly, I will not be replacing it with the same brand.",0
Matches all skin types,1
I won't recommend this for sensitive teeth.,0
Bottle had mold in it.,0
Exactly as I anticipated and works well.,1
great product!,1
"I made a mistake in getting this product. I saw clay mask and quickly jumped. So when it arrived and said it was for men I was a little disappointed. I had to turn around and tell my husband that it was imperative that he let me slather this all over his face. He wasn't extremely happy with me but he yielded with the exception that he apply it.

Once he washed his face he applied the slightest film and I kept telling him to apply more. His first reaction was, well that's cost effective. So that being said, I've used a lot of masks myself and I noticed that this one seemed to separate and didn't look like my own masks when drying. So I decided to try it for myself using a bit more product with the same results. This definitely leaves the skin soft which is what I love in masks but I'm not sure it did much else. After a few applications I didn't notice any difference with my husbands face.

I'll certainly make him continue this routine and insist that he use it until it's gone but I'm not sure if that will change the results any. For now I'm not majorly impressed. I think for the price I could find him something at the drug store that would work the same if not better for a fraction of the price. I myself use a mask that's approximately $10 more with way better results. That brand also has a line for men and if I really pushed the matter I would purchase that for my husband.",0
My white hair was for some reason turning yellow.  The Klorane shampoo seems to be helping with keeping it away.  I love the shampoo!,1
Maintains soft and frizz free curls!,1
"fantastic top coat, just dries too fast in the bottle",1
"Good moisturizer, i have relaxed hair. I apply it every night before bed, and I wake with moisturised silky texture hair.",1
Didnt work for me. Its overpriced,0
"Does an amazing job on face wrinkles and crows feet.  Not too much luck for me for under-the-eye circles -- it does lighten them for me a bit, but doesn't seem to minimize them.  :-(  Elsewhere, on my face and forehead, amazing (but, of course, temporary -- need 2 use it daily).",1
I won't go back to regular polish again.  I love doing my nails and it lasting for two weeks.  Great product!,1
Great color because it has an iridescent effect to it.  Perfect for hands and toes.  My Favorite color of all-time and a trusted brand.,1
Good curling iron. Not sure it gets as hot as I would like it to.,1
"Cant really rate the cream because the trial size. tube literally came with less than one single full use. It seemed like it had less than 1/4 of the contents even in it, so idk if it was used or just never filled correctly - either way poor quality control and disappointing :/",0
"Looove this color. It is the exact shade of my eyelids, and I've been told repeatedly that my features are enhanced with only having a little on, because women don't want to show such a great difference when wearing or not wearing makeup. I highly recommend it!",1
Works great. Just wish it wasn't $20 for the little guy.,1
I'm on my 3rd.,1
Did not like it was oily,0
"An easy way to keep your skin hydrated. Smells amazing, I use it every day!",1
The lotion is fantastic but using it makes you smell like an old man.  My wife and sister both commented on the terrible scent.  Sadly I had to give the lotion away it was so bad.,0
"works great, but the packaging caused me to only have a little less than half the bottle left to use. :(",0
I had to return this item because it did NOT curl my hair at all. It was terrible...  This was the first item I have ever had to return and Amazon made it very easy.,0
I found this to be extremely oily for some reason that has never happened before so I stopped using it when I sprayed it on oil came out instead of makeup,0
Supersmile does a good job.  Does help with teeth whitening so long as you use daily and follow instruction.,1
It doesn't clean my lashes.. I prefer Clinique,0
seems good. everyone likes it so I use it but can't really say it's done anything great,1
Love this stuff!  Great product,1
The product is good but rather expensive for the size.,1
Worked but not very well,0
"Ordered this cause it was recommended on other websites to try for pregnancy acne , been using for 1 month and don't feel it's helped me, but pregnancy acne can have a mind of its own. It may work different for other people",0
May have been nice if it weren't so dried out. Seemed like a product that had been too long on the shelf.,0
"Overall, it is a great safety razor that I have used as a woman to shave my legs. It is all about the angle and the blade to get a close shave but I rarely, nicked myself when using that safety razor. This us a great transition razor for a woman who is looking to change from the disposable or five blade razors. My boyfriend did try the razor for his face and found it slightly difficult to use, but he isn't seven foot tall with extra large hands either. he is average height about 5'10"". My only issue with this razor is that after about a year now, it is showing signs of rust forming inside where the blade is. However, part of me wonders if it is from the pre shave oil I am using.

Main point: It is an overall great razor, but it may rust.",1
"This product caused my eyes to be very irritated & red, burning, etc.  I'm going to give it one more try but am hesitant!",0
"This perfume smells softly fruity without being too sweet.  It can be a bit strong at first, but on me, the perfume doesn't last all day.  Perhaps it's my dry skin.  The bottle is lovely.  I believe the price is fair for the volume and quality of the perfume. I say give it a try.",1
love butter polish....this color was just a bit light for me.........has shimmer to it but is light even with 2 coats.,1
Only came in a .17 oz container. Got half of what I thought I was paying for. Works well though.,0
very juicy still smells good though,0
I PURCHASED THIS ITEM AND THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE TRIED TO STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT. I DID NOT RECEIVE THE BRUSH IT WAS SAPOSE TO COME WITH IT. I TRIED USING A DIFFERENT BRUSH I HAVE AND THE PRODUCT DID NOT APPLY WELL AND DID NOTHING LIKE THE DESCRIPTION SAID IT WOULD DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE!!,0
"I really like these combination colors, very pretty",1
Not what I thought. I purchased this on a recommendation from my hair stylist.  About 2-3 weeks after I get my highlights/color I need to have some 'added help' with the nagging grays that work their way in.  I tried WOW and it was less than WOW.  It doesn't seem to cover up and I have to use a lot to make any progress... then it's too much.  Honestly I get better results with my $6 brown eye-shadow as it covers better.,0
"Altough the price is steep, I believe it does what it says. Along with a microderm abrasion treatment, I have used this product for about 3 months. A little goes a long way. has really helped my blotchy skin",1
this product is great for oily skin. You only have to use like a dime size to clean the face. It has little beads in it to exfoliate your skin lightly. It will leave your face free of OIL yessssss!,1
Works well for me!,1
This smells fantastic- and works better than anything else for dry fly-away hair.,1
"I cannot say it does not work, but it has just little effect.",0
"I fail to see any benefits from using this product. I am 54 years old and see no difference after 3 weeks of use. I saw where many complained of using the gel, however that was never a big issue. You don't need much and it wipes off easily with a warm washcloth. I would recommend you keep your money in your pocket.",0
"Used many different Benzoyl Peroxide products over the years, Oxy, Proactiv, tried em all. This one so far after a month of use has worked the best, nearly immediate results. However, you need to stick with a routine, at least 2x a day, lots of water and CLEAN pillow cases! It won't just do all the work on it's own.",1
Product came without seal :(,0
"I received a small sample of this product from my hair stylist and loved it. It was very effective at taming my frizzy hair and did not leave an oily residue. I was excited to order a larger size that would last longer. However, the bottle that I received leaks. Every time I spray it, it leaks around the base of the spray mechanism. While the product is great, I won't be able to use it because it leaves oily droplets all over my bathroom with every use. I am disappointed.",0
"I like this and would buy it again. Was pleasantly surprised with the consistency, and liked how easily it melted into my hands. I was nervous that because it is ""powder"" that it would leave white streaks in my hair like some of the other products out there that claim to go on clear but really don't. I like using this on days where I'm going between washes for my hair to build on the texture.",1
This shampoo works very well. Its a light foam and has a baby powder type smell to it. I washed my sons hair with it twice and the cradle cap is completely gone. Definitely recommend!,1
"This works well, with or without water - great clean smelling and cleanses the skin leaving it feeling smooth. Not an abrasive product, just good cleaning.

Jo",1
I bought 2 of these and I'm very disappointed. These cost the full price of an Essie polish so I expected it to be authentic... These are watered down fakes. I wish Amazon would do a better job of regulating this stuff:(,0
"thick, not very emollient and stinks to high heaven. had to return it.",0
Amazon sells .fabgirl but I bought fatgirl at Ulta & you can definitely feel it working. Anyone know the difference?? Just realizing:(,0
Love the color and the polish last along time. No need for touch ups.,1
This was purchased as a remedy for acne and it has been useful. Cleanses skin nicely if you used properly.,1
"Must be a ""second"" Brush is a mess.",0
"Arrived leaking and had to return.  However, it smelled really nice. Will reorder.",0
Very good,1
"its a great curling iron
only thing is that the handle that makes the iron grab ur hair doesnt close like a normal iron does
so it makes curling my long hair a pain in the butt :/",0
The perfume itself is nice. But the price is a rip off and the bottle is soooo tiny. Don't let the picture fool you,0
"I absolutely love this product! I tried other but the fail in comparison of this rose water with aloe! It is best used for toner after a fresh wash, a long mask, even on top of your makeup. I love the dewy finish. It is a must have for people with combination skin. A little goes a long way.",1
this thing is magic!,1
"I was disappointed to find that there were only 6 eye masks per box. This was NOT clearly described in the description of the Elemis eye masks, it merely says .1lbs which gives no indication of how many come in a box (and nowhere on the box have I found a weight so who's to say if the product is actually .1lbs). For $85 I feel ripped off.",0
"I have relatively dry skin.  Especially after a hot shower and a facial scrub.  Without lotion, my face gets a bit ""ashy"".  I had been using Nivea for Men's Revitalizing Q10 lotion, but decided to give Jack Black a try since it's SPF 20 and it says it's ""Double Duty"".  Sounded impressive.  Unfortunately, it fell way short of my expectations.  I will slather about 8-10 pumps of this stuff all over my face in an effort to get more moisturizing, and yet, in less than two hours, my face will be dry and ashy again.  As if I hadn't put anything on at all.  I'm sure some of you will appreciate that this lotion isn't ""greasy"", but you might as well not put anything on your face at all than spend this much money on a facial lotion that is gone in less than two hours.  Returning this and going back to my much more affordable Nivea for Men Q10 lotion.",0
At first I was disappointed by how little product there is but a little goes a long way. It covers my dirty blonde roots really well. I expect it'll last about 6 months. It seems a little overpriced but the color is spot on for my dye job. Product arrived quickly. It doesn't fade out throughout the day either and will last until you wash it out.,1
"Two stars because of the color and need for reapplication. I also have to set with powder for staying power. Can't say I'd recommend the product because I've found that drug store brand nude eye pencils to be as, if not more, effective in coverage. I have only a small area above my lip, this product hasn't worked for me.",0
Order Sheer Obession was sent regular Obsession company credited and email me a return label. Still do not have product that I wanted but it was nice to get a credit and return postage.,0
You need to use three coats otherwise it looks water down,0
Love it but don't like the smell. Not like the shampoo or conditioner. Smells rancid,1
I am all about bling and this polish doesn't fail in that department.  It has all the colors in the glitter.  Not just browns. I put it over top of a base color such as brown but it would work with anything.  I love it and my nail salon seems to as well.  They try to keep it every time I take it in there :),1
"Looks just like real hair! Okay, so let me start by saying that I had alopecia (not sure on the spelling) when I was in college. The hair on the sides of my head, right above my ears just thinned out and has never grown back. I always wear my hair down because it's easy to cover the spots with my curly hair. However, if I ever want to wear my hair up, I'm faced with exposing my 2-Half-Dollar-sized bald spots. I've colored in the spots before, but I go through those eye pencils way too quickly and they aren't exactly real looking. These Fibers are the first thing that has really allowed me to wear my hair up and look normal. Don't get me wrong, I'm still keeping an eye out for a hair growth miracle, but in the mean time, this will do. ;)

PS: Several people have actually mistaken this product for successful regrowth on my head.",1
"First, the color shown here, which looks like a soft apricot, was actually a garish orange: my toes look like I am wearing orange peel! Second, as another reviewer mentioned, the polish goes on streaky, and it was only after much effort, and much time, that I was able to achieve some semblance of coverage.  I have never thrown out a polish, but this one I did. I think I will stick to Opi polishes, they have a better quality overall.  As for this Essie polish: COMPLETE FAIL, I hated it!!",0
I like it,1
"I've been using Dior mascaras for many years. Decided to give Stila a try after a review I read on Instagram from a fashion blogger. Well, I regret spending my money on this mascara. It fails to give the length other high end mascaras give. Like none at all. My lashes were pretty much the same length. It does give good coverage and fullness, but the lashes just wouldn't extend to give the long look you want when using mascara. I had to put this product on and use the brush of my old mascara to obtain some lenght. I wouldn't recommend this mascara to any of my friends.",0
I have been using this product for quite a while purchasing it from the salon is very expensive. The price on Amazon is much better. I recommend this product.,1
It looks fake to me,0
"Expensive I thought, tryed and tryed and didn't do anything. Save your money and buy some good mascara. Ought to have a money back gaurentee",0
"This is a great item.  Just be careful with the charger.  If it slips off the surface and the circular light is off, then it's not charging.  Other than that, it works really well.",1
I bought this in September w great results. I reordered in Dec and the serum is yellow instead of clear/ white and has a sour smell.,0
Love the Body Butter!  Received it as a gift last Christmas and was thankful for 2-day delivery to get my next tube.  Will continue to purchase as long as they make it!,1
"I can't understand the good reviews that this product gets.  It feels like sand paper applying it to your face!  It is so irritating! I hate it and will never purchase again.  It's expensive so I will continue to use it until it is gone, but every day I regret the purchase!",0
Horrible. Made my hair look dirtier. Maybe not good for fine hair which is what I have.,0
"AMAAAAAAAZING, buttery and unbelievable demure yet out there shimmer..",1
"Great products. The no rinse baby wash smells so good and is great for quick face body or head clean-ups. The foaming shampoo is a must have for every mom. Wish I received this at my shower. So I will consider this as a gift for others at their shower.  I remember when I first tried the product a year ago I did not care too much for the smell, but it grows on you by the time you finish using the product.",1
"Haven't tried the curling iron itself, I am sure it's a great one BUT the thing came in the mail 1) poorly packaged 2) looked used! Had spots on it.",0
"The consistency is fairly watery compared to most conditioners I've ever used.  Did not detangle my hair and left it feeling sticky.  I'm wondering if I got a tampered product, since I've never used this one before.  Maybe if I bought it in a salon it would work better?  It's so bad I won't even finish the bottle.",0
I wasn't impressed at all. This product didn't do anymore for my lashes than less expensive mascara. Wouldn't recommend it.,0
This is a really cute and sturdy little compact. I admit I bought it out of curiosity - I wanted to see the size of the pots inside. They are SMALLLLLLL. I have no makeup pots that fit in it. I was going to just press powder directly into the holes but there is enough of a gap under the hole insert that the powder would probably seep. So.... I don't know what I am going to do with this now.,0
"I use it all the time, but would be happier if the bristles were just a bit less firm.",1
didn't like to runniness of it,0
"Definitely helps a lot, even with me not using a DE razor. It does gum up multi-bladed safety razors like a Mach5 or what have you, so be prepared to rinse a little more vigorously. Well worth that little bit of extra effort though, it combines with good shaving soap to cut (hah) way down on hair pulling and skin irritation.  And it smells nice, not cloying or overpowering at all.",1
"I was so surprised to see so many good reviews of this product.  I have sensitive skin which is prone to redness so I try a lot of different brands.  This is one of the worst.  I thought I would try this due to the ""alcohol free"" and ""oil free"" claims.

The only part of this trio that I actually liked was the daily face wash.  It foams up great with a very clean feeling and very little perfuming.  I would give this product a very good review.

The bad reviews are the others in the trio.  The ""alcohol free"" mint herbal toner...is it really alcohol free?  I loved chemistry class and most words that ended with col and ethyl were alcohol related.  There were many words listed in the ingredients with these endings.  The mint does cover the alcohol smell!  I've already dumped it into the toilet and then worried that it may pollute the Chesapeake.

Lastly, the oil free moisturizer is like covering my skin with mud.  I thought from the description that it would be light but it just makes me sweat for a couple hours after application.",0
"Massively disappointing. I bought this because I'm allergic to most nail polish and was hoping Butter London, being ""8-free"", as they claim, would be a good substitute. Well, I never discovered whether or not I'd develop a reaction to it because within 15 minutes of applying, it peeled right off my nails like cellophane. I've never seen anything like it. I didn't even get my nails wet or subject them to any kind of wear and tear. They just started to peel and fell right off.

Considering this polish is twice the price of O.P.I. (which breaks my heart I can't wear anymore), you'd think they'd try to produce a quality product. Instead, this stuff goes on thin as water, then peels off almost as fast as it dries. Truly worthless.",0
This brush looks used and is brown. I don't think it's an authentic brush. I will be returning.,0
"Fantastic grooming set: nice case, high quality tools, with an impressive look and feel.  They will likely last many years.

Minus one star for the price. I mean, really?",1
"I am not sure if I got an old item or if this is the real deal but when I opened this, the brush was stiffed and it was hard to work on the color. I have bought several CND Shellac from other sellers before and none of it was like this. I should have checked the item as soon as I received ot bit being inside the box, i thought there was not going to be a problem. I am planning to contact seller if this is still eligible for exchange.",0
Shaving cream was nice but honestly didn't notice that much of a difference from other cheaper creams I have used.  The only thing I will note is I shave in the shower and dealing with the cap on the tube is a headache.  Not a big deal but aerosol cans are a tad easier.,1
Love this perfume.,1
"Great primer. It brightens my eye lid area, evens the skin tone of my eyelids and keeps my eye shadow in place all day. I like it and would buy it again.",1
good,1
very good,1
"So oily I felt like it never set on my skin. Whether I just applied it or I had been wearing it for an hour, I could wipe it right off my face with just my finger. No idea how this could be waterproof since it feels like it never actually set on my skin. It looks oily too and is pricey for such a small amount. I don't like any of MDSolarScienxes products- the tinted SPFs all had this same issue and they also made my skin red and sensitive. I'm definitely allergic to one of the ingredients they use.",0
This product was open when I received it. There was no white seal that typically covers Mario badescu products.,0
"Does nothing to block humidity from naturally curly ""ethnic"" hair that's been blown out. Total frizz fest.",0
"This is supposed to be a moisture mask, but feels less moisturizing than, say, Avene's Skin Recovery Cream. Plus, like some of the other Avene moisturizers I've tried, this one also has a (albeit very mild) ammonia-like odor that's really off-putting.",0

"one thing is not a body gel is a facial cream help get of redness and it balance your skin , I used this over 3 years and can't go without it",1
I Have bad nails and this polish lasts better than others i have used,1
"I love this stuff.  I have searched and searched for product with sunscreen that won't irritate my face.  I have bottles and bottles of bb cream, cc cream, and face lotions with SPF, all of which irritate my skin and around my eyes.  So, I just didn't wear sunscreen---GASP! and I live in Florida--GASP-GASP!

I was hesitant because of the tint, I do not wear foundation, but it's so slight, I hardly noticed.  I loved the matte finish.

I'm so happy I finally found something that works for me!",1
"This product really works, I love it. Like the idea of it being a hair spray and a dry shampoo plus texturizing",1
Didn't work for me.,0
"I like the concept, but the head of the toothbrush is too big.  Also, the handle grip is big and smooth, so it gets slippery if you are a messy-drippy brusher.  If you have a larger mouth you could try them, but if not skip it.",0
I have been using this polish for a couple of months and get many compliments.,1
it not good items it very different between items from original store i pay it and from my local store it very liquid and not as color creem  i contact with customer service to refund but i don't know what he do it bad order i will not pay,0
"I've had mine for about 2 years now. It did a great job under my arm--a stray hair now and then, otherwise bare. Also great on my upper lip and chin on the dark hairs. (I bought this fully understanding it works best on darker hair/lighter skin.)

I am still working on my legs, but I blame that on being tall with most of my height in the legs and not particularly applying myself to the job.

One thing that I didn't know when I bought it and found out when contacting customer service about the tool not flashing is that it does not do as well in bright light. But, I 'work around' this simply by using my body to shade the area I am working on from the overhead light.

Well worth what I spent on it considering what they want for decent razor cartridge refills.",1
"it has good coverage, just not great for my skin type",1
Does absolutely NOTHING!!!,0
Awful! Smudges and thick! Wish I could return. Amazon does not authrorize returns for liwquid so beware when you buy polish on sight.,0
I use this product all of the time and am very happy with it.,1
horrible and the price even worst. Not made for every hair type,0
Doesn't work to cover my dark roots. Sticky and ineffective. Hard to use and it's a worthless effort.  I should have know it was too good to be true.,0
I like it but it has a slight smell  but it makes my skin soft,1
"Cologne's different on everyone, so please take my experience with a grain of salt.

  To me, Artisan starts off with a kick of citrus to your face; it feels like someone ripping open a box of mandarin oranges and freshly-crushed thyme right underneath your nose upon first application.  It's juicy, and strong.

  After a few minutes, Artisan evens out with a pleasing floral note (orange blossoms, as I'm told), and you catch hints of aromatic wood and sweet musk.  Sadly, this fades away within an hour or two, and the cologne no longer projects.  If you move in close, you'll detect a feint whiff of what it once was (it smells as if someone lightly dabbed orange peel and vanilla on your skin).

  At $78 retail for the 4.2 oz bottle (I purchased Artisan from a department store), this kills Artisan as a likable product for me.  As other users have alluded, you're paying to get teased.  To find the silver lining, I'd recommend Artisan for short term use, in occasions such as walks on the beach, coffee dates, a trip to the store, etc.  To note, I've also had better longevity with Artisan in warmer climates.

  All in all, if the makers manage to extend the longevity and projection of Artisan, I'd be a lifetime customer.  As is, however, I'm sticking with another cologne as my primary, and will toss my bottle of Artisan out, along with any attachment to it, as soon as occasion allows for it to run out.",0
I have been using this as a dandruff relief for my hair and is pretty good.,1
"When we received, the bottle was empty.",0
i just opened it and it's 90% water. no good. throwing in the trash.,0
This product just isn't for me.  It doesn't apply easily and is quite visible under the eyes.  Other types of concealers are better.,0
"I purchased this fragrance due to price.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I sprayed on Legend and it was forgotten in one hour or less.  I cannot detect any smell on me or my clothing.  What is foul is that you cannot return it. Warning,  Be careful!!!!!",0
"It's a pretty color but when I think of a ""stain"" I think of something that last a lot longer.  This is off in minutes.",0
I can only apply this to my face.  If I apply it to my neck I get a slight rash.  Not for sensitive skin.,0
"It was very watery, had a nice smell but did not last long. Would not recommend this to anyone. Did not care for it.",0
love this brand of eyeliners!,1
"This product works well. It leaves your skin nice and soft.  You can wear it under make up and works well.  I like the bottle it comes in, easy to dispense.  Price is comparable to other products that are similar.  I find it works just as well as other products, I have yet to find the miracle in a bottle and I have tried many with high hopes.  I am consistent with my use, to get best results.  I find this one is no better or no worse than any of the others I have tried.  I will keep using and when the bottle is empty, I will update my review if my opinion changes.",1
The top was broken which makes it very difficult to handle.  I've almost dropped it numerous times.  Wish I would've bought it locally.,0
"The lotion is a great quality, but it smells like oregano!  I took it to the office and everyone agreed that the lotion has a funky smell.....",0
My favorite mist there is!  Will buy again,1
Color was just right and covers very well.,1
Bought this curling iron in November. Five months later it's broken and won't even turn on. I'm so disappointed because when it was working it was perfect.,0
"flimsy packet, Occitane should be ashamed of itself",0
"Very popular in Europe for it's wrinkle fighting ability. The price is a bit high, though. I would recommend it to others.",1
"Love putting this stuff on on the weekends when I want to run to the grocery store or Target in the morning, but am not quite ready t have on a full face of makeup. It is not very moisturizing though, so I do put on my face lotion first, and then a small amount of this tinted lotion.",1
"For the price I paid, bottle should have been full to the top and when I pulled off the small screen on top the bottle is only half full.  This made the product look cheap since you did not fill it up to the top.  Not worth the price!",0
Completely satisfied,1
This is a great eyeliner.  It goes on thin and lasts until I wash it off with soap and water.  A tube lasts me about 6 months.,1
This is a useless product. It doesn't do as promised and has little to no effect. I don't approve. done,0
"Sold by my hair salon. After trying it once, I never bought another serum / oil again (and Ive tried many). Its heavy duty without being heavy on the hair, somehow. Great to be able to buy on Amazon",1
I don't like using antiperspirants . . and this is deodorant only!  Great fragrance and very effective deodorant.  Hard to find except on Amazon.,1
"I use it pre-shave.  Its a good product, I may buy it again.  I only use Jack Black skin products after years of other brands.  Recommended.",1
Yes this made my hair feel soo amazing I love it ,1
Ok but not amazing.,0
"This stuff really works-- I bought this four months ago and I have definitely seen a noted improvement in the lines in my face. I use a little bit before I go to work every morning and I can definitely see the difference even just after a few hours of putting it on. Also, the product lasts a very long time, so if you're worried about getting your money's worth, trust me, you will. You only need a little bit to cover the entire face. Great product in my opinion.",1
"The directions state to apply this with a cotton pad and you don't have to wash it off.  I, however, applied it with my hand on one side of my face, and it felt wonderful.  I did wash it off, and my skin incredibly soft.  I applied it on the other side of my face and did not wash it off, and this side too felt great.  This product is amazing and perfect for ageing skin.",1
It was not the real stuff I have always used. Very disappointed. Had to throw it away and get the real stuff from the store.,0
"Given that I am a token male in my family (well, I have a son, but he has a family of his own), I gave this concealer to the fairer (and significantly cuter) family members to test.  The verdict was that this concealer had a great color and conceals minor blemishes well.  I heard that both ladies that tried it liked the way it went on to their faces, and how other makeup could be used on top of the concealer.

While this concealer is a bit expensive, it is relatively reasonably priced as compared to many concealers you buy in makeup sections of high end department stores, and you get a relatively large amount of concealer.  I admit that ""large amount"" for me is like a gallon.  Apparently, makeup manufacturers believe in the theory that less is...well, less.  Or about the amount that you can use before the concealer dries out beyond the ability to use it.

Okay, so the color is fine, it applies well, it conceals minor blemishes with a smooth finish, and you get a goodly quantity.  It seems like this concealer is a good value and works for most people!

Enjoy!",1
Awful.. caught on fire!!!!.,0
"I already have naturally some-what wavy hair,but I just don't like the way my waves look. I purchased this product hoping it would change that. I have very fine hair, that gets greasy really quick. This product didn't give me ""beach waves"", it actually didn't really do anything different to my hair other than making it a lot greasier than it already is. Hopefully I can find a product that does give me that sexy beach looking hair.",0
"I love these cleaning cloths! I am usually very lazy and don't always remove my eye makeup before going to bed. I've tried other cloths in the past and didn't care for the smell and they seemed too harsh. These cloths are amazing, the scent is just enough without being too strong, they're gentle on my eyes, and I give my face a once over with them too, since the cloths are so large, it seems wasteful otherwise, and it's so refreshing.",1
waste of money,0
This is better than any high price name brand product of its kind,1
"It's halfway full and quit working.  Obviously, they have a problem with this because you can read the same issue in the other reviews.
Don't waste you money on it.
We use Bedhead now.",0
"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1
"This product truly would cost 5 times as .such anywhere else.  I have long lashes so I can't give a scientific response as to how much they'grown, but on its own, its still a great mascara.
I rarely read directions,, but don't get it in eye while applying to lower lashes, or just do the tips, or you may have some runny eyes if their sensitive. Haven't used long enough to see how much lengthening,, but like all Cargo, it's a great mascara at this price, and I will be buying more from this seller.  Lots more!  Great company and prices cannot be beat. SO  happy I found them on Amazon!",1
I was recommended this product by my hairdresser. First off I think it was defective b/c it didn't get hot. It was too wide and I couldn't get small hair pieces in. I sent it back and they gave me a hassle free full return.,0
It's okay.,0
This device did not work for me. I don't know why. There was no difference in my skin. It could be because i was pregnant when i bought it and my skin is not its best when am pregnant. So i had to return it before the end of the 30 days return. I could not keep it until i give birth to know if it did not work because of pregnancy. So it might be because of the baby. I don't know . But it did not work for me.,0
Butter is a high end nail polish that has a price tag to match...what a rip off!!! after only TWO days -- it chips -- take my advice and avoid this high priced low quality crap!,0
This color is really cute and romantic.,1
A very effervescent feeling but doesn't really make the shave more comfortable than just using soap.,0
I purchased the alloy color and found it did not go on as described.  I did not go on easily.  Perhaps it was the color.,0
"I love these tan towels!  They apply incredibly easy, and as advertised.  For a full body application, I do need to use two (because they are half body towels) and I normally use one for my legs, and then the other for my upper body.  I have relatively light skin and they do not make me look orange at all.
The reason why I did no give full stars is because after one application in specific, my legs were incredibly streaky which I had no experienced before.  I soon found that it was because they were very dry and the formula did not distribute evenly to my dry skin.  I moisturize now before applying and I get my tan now without a hitch!",1
"It's a perfectly adequate lotion, and the scent is pleasant. However, it smells nothing like either lavender or honeysuckle. The only reason I paid such an exorbitant amount of money for a bottle of lotion was because I specifically wanted something that smelled like honeysuckle.
If you like overpriced lotions, buy away, but if you're looking for something specific, you're out of luck with this one.",0
"Ordered this because it said 2 12 oz bottles with $5.99 shipping... the ad even shows 2 bottles, i received 1 bottle and the add still shows 2 bottles but they have taken off the ""2"". will not buy again, buyer beware",0
Improvement in firmness; plan to continue to use.,1
"I read the reviews on this iron about people with fine hair having a lot of good luck with this curling iron, so I was sad when it didn't work for me. Even though I didn't expect the curl to last long, even with a ton of hairspray and all the other tricks I've tried over the years, my hair was completely flat in less than 30 minutes. Other curling irons have at least left a little curl on the ends and the look of hair that's been curled that day. I got neither from this iron. I would not recommend it, and am probably going to return it or try to sell it to someone else.",0
Great shampoo.,1
"I have a Babyliss in the UK which is great. So I bought one for here (USA ). This model is terrible. It doesn't grab the hair properly, tangles the hair it does grab, and is really a nuisance to use. Nothing like the UK version. Also, one has to apply much more tension comparatively and it's exhausting; I have thick mildly wavy/straight hair. Sending it back. Will try  Conair. Too bad UK version not sold here. (And adapters don't work well ).",0
good,1
"After applying I could feel the difference.  My hair feels smoother, looks shinier, and tangle free. Has a nice scent to it.",1
"I love the way that the scent quickly fills the entire house.  I don't have any of the black smoke or lack of scent issues mentioned from some other reviewers.  I am drawn more toward masculine scents that remind me of dens and cigars so I was initially disappointed that this scent was more sweet bergamot than tobacco.  However, the scent has really grown on me and I will definitely order this candle again.",1
Beautiful razor and it's great for a beginner.,1
Chips a whole lot faster than the other OPI colors I have.,0
Was opened & used!!,0
"For the price I am disappointed. I prefer my $20 straightener.  With the long part of this one it is hard for me to use this to assist with curling my hair. Also, it doesn't seem to meet in the middle to straighten.",0
I'm inlove with this duo concealer it's just a perfect touch up for brow and acne.,1
I didn't want a deodorant with a fragrance but was most looking forward to the fact it wouldn't leave a stain which it absolutely does.,0
"Works well with my curly, frizzy hair.  Apply on wet hair for best results.  Does a good job taming curls.",1
"This shadow palette comes in a very attractive case, with four shades of browns.  The colors are mostly from talc and are firmly in their dividers.  There is no applicator brush with this, though.  One can use one's finger (but that causes the color to get hardened by skin oils) or use a separate brush to apply the shadow over the lid.  The good thing is that this talc-based color does not crease easily in the skin.  The shades are very complimentary.  This is a nice collection of browns for younger women.",1
Baught the curling iron hoping it would work on my silky hair and was disappointed. Does not curl fine hair well!,0
"Love the scent, but the candle only burned 3/4 and then wouldnt light anymore!",0
Nice,1
"i'm disappointed. I have thick, wavy hair. I bought both this and the Paul Mitchell skinny serum to help try to make my hair a bit more manageable. The paul mitchell skinny serum seems to do a much better job at that, the Rusk one here doesn't seem to have much, if any effect on my hair.",0
I use Nioxin Scalp Treatment and Nioxin Cleanser to maintain hait strength and coloring.  I have used these products for years and recommend them to prevent loss of hair and premature whitening.,1
"The first time I tried it, it came on as one huge glob on my lashes. It is terrible. For that much money, I expected better.",0
My second bottle. Love it!,1
"This iron was very low quality and literally can burn your hair out if you are not careful, i understand that can be done with any iron, but this iron was to much of a risk. The only reason why i gave it a one star was becaus of the packging was very cute. I used the iron for just a little bit and had to throw it away, it just didn't last long enough and within a few uses, the iron looked very old and rusted.",0
"I do my own nails, I have for years, so naturally I could open a mini salon in my house with the amount of nail polish I own. I wanted to do a gel for vacation but couldn't bring myself to spend all that money at a salon (especially since I never think they do a better job than me and I have hundreds of colors here.) After 2 days of researching, I settled on this topcoat. My two requirements were it had to last and it had to work with regular polish. I'm putting it to the test. It's been one day, I will update in a week with new results

Base coat: Nailtiques (formula 2)
Polish: Essie pret-a-surfer
Topcoat: Vinylux

The Essie applies beautifully with one coat however while applying the topcoat, the polish became streaky so a second coat was added and the topcoat went on without a hitch thereafter. It took a while to dry completely (over an hour) and even then I didn't know if it would last through the night because it still felt a little off. My first time using this product so I didn't know if that was normal or not, but I woke up without any blanket creases and it feels like a regular polish now. My nails overall feel very strong as if I had wraps on. I have high hopes right now, but lets see if it can withstand the mom of two preschoolers life I live.

*****Update: it's been 48 hours; a trip to the mall, a trip to the grocery store, 8 loads of laundry, 3 sinks full of dishes, broke down about about a dozen boxes for the recycling, half a dozen showers (twins included) and general household cleaning/cooking and at the end of the weekend 1 nail chipped within 24 hours and 2 after 48....the rest are dulled with scratches. I'll still use it only because it's here. Maybe I'll pair it with the vinylux color polish and see how that goes in the future, but all hope is gone. My regular mani's have lasted longer.",0
Package came slightly dirty and with odd writing on it. Smelled good but gave me a rash. Not good for people with sensitive skin.,0
Delivered on time . Was perfect,1
"Toppik took a good product, CHANGED it, made the can smaller....and charged more! WHY???",0
Ok,1
"This brush was originally $44, really? I have a nylon plastic brush I got years ago I was using for dry brushing but wanted to get a natural one thinking it would be softer, more supple/have more give. But this brush is really stiff and hurts to use on my skin, I felt like it was ripping it... and I like to scrub with a loofah in the shower. I rinsed it a couple times in hot water thinking that would soften it up but the bristles just curled some and no luck. The wood is nice and it seems to be made fairly well, maybe it could be used for your feet? But if you're drying brushing your body especially sensitive areas like your chest, I'm no penny pincher but save your money and get a cheap nylon shower/back brush at Walgreens or a dollar store. I get the ""natural"" thing but your skin won't know the difference. I was having problems with bumpy skin and dry brushing is the only thing that has made my skin amazingly soft, I highly recommend it!",0
"I love Mario Badescu as a brand, and this gel cleanser is gentle and works as a nice basic cleanser. Mario Badescu is more expensive than regular drugstore brands, but the Enzyme cleanser is still only $12 for a huge 8 oz. bottle (even on Amazon!).

I wouldn't call this an amazing product, but it does give me a decent amount of chemical exfoliation, making my face really soft. Even better, it doesn't break me out, and smells really nice. The Enzyme cleanser is my ""down day"" cleanser; I use it interchangeably with my all-time favorite (but outrageously priced) Uriage Hysac cleansing gel, usually either in the nighttime, or when my skin is behaving really, really well and I don't need Hysac to save me (as it always does).

The texture of the cleanser itself is almost gelatinous, and a translucent green with some sort of shimmer throughout. It is purely a gel, and unlike shower gels, it does NOT lather up or foam. I usually just squirt a little on my hands and rub it evenly into my wet face, massaging it in for about a minute before washing it off. Make sure to splash your face with cold water before you dry off!

My only problem with it is that it contains methylparaben, which doesn't really matter THAT much to me, but may bother some people. The other ingredients, like most Mario Badescu products, seem natural and plant- or fruit-based, which I love.

I have an affinity for gel cleansers they are perfect for oily skin. Unlike cream cleansers, which can contain comedogenic oils, gels are great for oily skin types like me. I would suggest staying away from them if you have dry skin, though; oil-free cream-based or liquid-based cleansers are great for dry skin. The Enzyme cleansing gel is perfect for oily, breakout-prone skin, and it is also gentle enough to use on a daily basis.",1
Great sunscreen not greasy and fab for acne prone skin ! Dermatologist recommend it !,1
"Does exactly what it says it does. Leaves a clean, matte finish. Can't wait to use it on more colors!",1
Love it!!!!! I get soooooooooo many compliments on it. Men wanna lick me : ) and women wanna bite me ;-) haha,1
good product - once it runs out - I will buy it again,1
"I usually purchase my candles from Whole Foods but thought that I could get a better deal through Amazon (which the deals usually are), but the Archipelago Botanicals diffuser and candle set was bad... The candle did NOT have enough scent, and the diffuser was missing a part... I did not return it because it was too much trouble... I will stick to purchasing my candle in person.",0
Broke after a month and a half - 30 day return policy! Wont buy again,0
I had a great expectation based on other reviews but this product does not work at all for me.  I was quite disappointed!,0
"I had used Nioxin System 1 Cleanser for years.  It was wonderful for my baby-fine, thin hair.  It left my hair looking full, without any buildup, meaning that I never felt the need to alternate shampoos.  I always bought the jumbo size, and recently finished a bottle.  The new formula, which is no longer made in the U.S. leaves my hair stiff, dull, flat and coated.  After 3 shampoos, I feel the need to use a clarifying shampoo just to get some life back in my hair.  I am now looking for a replacement for my favorite shampoo.  Nioxin is no longer what it pretends to be!",0
"This came in a regular squeeze tube.  The last one I got had a pump, which always dispensed the right amount. I knocked off one star for that because I liked the pump and thought that was what I was getting.",1
Good gel but pump was broken when arrived,0
"First, the color shown here, which looks like a soft apricot, was actually a garish orange: my toes look like I am wearing orange peel! Second, as another reviewer mentioned, the polish goes on streaky, and it was only after much effort, and much time, that I was able to achieve some semblance of coverage.  I have never thrown out a polish, but this one I did. I think I will stick to Opi polishes, they have a better quality overall.  As for this Essie polish: COMPLETE FAIL, I hated it!!",0
"I just put some of this lotion on tonight. (gradual tan with moisturizer and no added coloring).  I have up til now been using Jergens Natural Glow normally and was glad that this year the woody smell had been much improved.  I heard about this product from someone who raved that the smell was so much better than any other tanner and the color was better too.

Well, I put it on my legs, chest and neck.  I admit I did not try it on a small spot first as advised on the container.  I had read this when buying a couple weeks ago, but forgot about it by tonight.  No sign of any *skin* sensitivity so far, thank goodness, but the smell is overwhelming!

The actual odor is fine, it's how strong it is.  The list of ingredients on it is very long and with many chemicals.  Within a short time my throat started to feel raw and my eyes were a little irritated.  The smell became overwhelming - did not diminish as the product dried.

Finally I had to try to wash it off my upper body.  This helped quite a bit.  If the leg application doesn't bother me, and the color is good, I may continue to use it only there.  But it simply is not on for any above waist application.  Thank goodness I didn't try it on my face!

Others may not have this sensitivity - I have always been sensitive to smells and suffer from dry eyes.  Just wanted to warn anyone else who might have the same problems to be warned.  For the sensitive I recommend Jergens.  It has always been the best self tanner on the market to get a bit of color, and now it beats the micro-mist tan since the new smell is a huge improvement.  Just sayin'.",0
"The color is nice, however, it hasn't done what it's stated to do- plump lips. High price for a lip gloss...",0

Terrible. I paid 25.00 for an opener bottle that had barely anything in it.,0
"This seems okay.  It says to use instead of conditioner once a week, which I did.  My hair might be lighter but it is not noticeably different.  I will continue to use it and update if there is more change after more than four weeks.  The only thing I really didn't like was that the spray was a very small amount and it says to apply liberally.  I have a ton of hair so this took a lot of time and since I was in the shower, I couldn't really tell if I was getting it on every section of my hair.",0
"For starters, this isn't a review of the brush per se, but of the size. Most brushes are measured from outside of bristle to outside of bristle. Not this brush. The size measures the column and the brushes, approx 1/2"", are in addition to that. The brush I received was enormous.

I'm assuming it's just old.  I should have returned within 30 Days but too late now.",0
I got mine to pink,0
Very disappointed received my make up and it was broken into pieces,0
"I have purologies conditioner which I absolutely love, so I was expecting a similar type of feel.  This leave in condition falls up short.  I have hair that is about 4 inches below the shoulder.  I've tried this product several times.  It feels very sticky in my hands and when dried can leave my hair feeling stiff and I never put on more than 1 pump.  My hair is no easier to comb out than if I didn't use the product at all.

My advice to people is to buy their regular conditioners and don't waste your money on this product!  They need to go back to the drawing board on this one.",0
"This is a fake bottle, do not buy. It smells totally different and dried my nails out. Clearly not the original, sad I waited to open it until now.",0
I bought the toilette for my daughter because Kelly Rippa from t.v. Praised it as fresh w/ shuttle fragrance. We were very disappointed. The fragrance was strong and not pleasant.,0
Goes on very smoothly and covers minor imperfections. Sunblock works. Smells a little rubbery at first...only negative is its hard to wash off..I have to use warm water and a washcloth and kinda scrub BUT i guess thats good sunblock :)  I just have very sensitive skin so my face gets irritated,1
"I love this makeup bag! Large enough for some skincare products, some smaller eye shadow pallets, eyebrow pen, eyeliner pen, eye shadow sticks, small tube of primer,...etc. Love that the plastic material is thick and sturdy. It can stand up on its own!

I love that the little gold button logo adds a little bit more design interest to the bag. I think otherwise it'd be a bit too plain. The color is exactly what I wanted/expected.

Only reason this isn't a 5-star review is because the zipper can be a little fidgety. And I feel that they cheaped out on the lining - it looks like cheap ugly patent leather or something, especially for the price!",1
"good,
Great hair looks great",1
"I like the product overall, but this size (1oz) is really a travel size.
For those individuals that said it left a 'light colored residue' on their hair: I am betting you are not applying the product correctly.  If you go to Klorane's website they specifically say thay you should use it VERY sparingly and that you should spray from 10-12 inches away.  I find that if I hold my head upside down and lightly spritz as I fluff, the product works wonderfully.",1
"My sensitive skin rejects most products.  This cleanser works very well and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.  I have soft water in my home and it has helped my skin stay nice, too.",1
This nail strengthened did nothing for me! Will not buy again I requested a refund!,0
"This stuff works,
I have thinning hair from medications I take for my illness.
This help in making my hair look fuller. Easy to apply and remove.",1
"Saw this on Dr. Oz and was interested.  It does a good job of filling in the thinning spots on my scalp.  Doesn't flake off, which I was worried about.  Can be out in windy weather and it works great.",1
I got this with pretty low expectations. I have had professional laser hair removal and wanted something for touch ups. I thought this might work so far no luck. I can set this at it's highest rating with ease as the professional laser was a lot stronger. I would save your money.,0
"handle broke after a month, but was able to piece it back together",1
"I bought this product at the salon at Cancer Treatment Centers of America.  I love it but it just makes my nails look natural.  I show my french manicure off to friends but they can't see it (neither can I).  I do have healthy, strong nails, but I want people to SEE my french manicure  :o)  So far I have been adding another white on top of the tip perfector, something more opaque but I want to use all Zoya product.  The product is GREAT but I want to be able to SEE it!  I might try ""Lucy"" as a tip perfector but I will see what response I get from the community as I posted the question as to if I can use ""Lucy"" as a tip perfector.",1
Love this smell but I received a fake have a little left from my original I bought at a designer store and this garbage only lasts about an hour then fades away also when checking the site with the batchcode on the bottom of the box this did not come out giving me proof that this is fake should have just bought it from macys,0
Great product!,1
I thought this would be a good moisturizer for me because it was oil-free and had SPF15 in it.  I live in Arizona and sunblock everday is a must.  However I have oily skin and most moisturizers leave me with a shiny face.  This one is no exception.  I tried putting just a thin layer of the product on my skin and it left me with an oil slick look.  I will not buy this one again.,0
"Complete and utter rip off. First, It's listed at 2oz but I have a hard time believing that there are 2 fluid ounces in the spray can. Second, while I do have thick hair, the scent lasts for only an hour before it dissipates. I've tried the product on three separate occasions now. That said, the product does seem to linger on my bathroom countertop. Not exactly helpful. Not worth $5 and certainly not worth $25.",0
"After 2 uses it already started cracking and separating. There aren't many other mitts (the ones that I have tried are as bad, if not worse) on the market so I don't really have a choice but to get another one of these...",0
Waste of money,0
"I love the way this product makes my skin feel, and the scent is wonderful too. I also noticed a decrease in acne with the use of this, so that's a bonus. It also came with some small free samples! A++ product!",1
"i've been trying to transition to this razor for several months now and still can't use it with out cutting my face. the newer 4 blade disposable systems do work better. I know using this style of shaver is fun and sleek looking, that's why I switched. I'm ready to switch back to the newer and more advanced type, eg.... gillette fusion. isn't technology great?
I've tried different brand razors too including the Feather.",0
Gave this a try and wasn't disappointed although it was a bit greasy when I would put it on my face.,1
"Easy to reach roots, hears up quickly. The name rubbed off the top within one use though. Overall all good",1
"I like this product being that it's easy to put on.  Before that, I have to rinse my hair with shampoo  to make it easier to manage and don'the worry, I do use conditioner when taking a shower.  So after, drying my hair and placing this gel with one or two pumps makes it easy to style.  It does hold up just fine (even though it was raining)  No white clumps or specs of hairgel.  I expect this product to last longer as my hair doesn't require much gel to shape and hold, but, at the same time, I feel this is a better by than at the regular stores.  No complaints hete.",1
"It is NOT purple; it is burgundy at best.  The picture in the bottle certainly looks to be purple.  The description says ""purple shades"", Marrow.

It is a brownish burgundy.

I like the shape of the bottle and that it isn't as tippy as OP and no toxins.

Getting color to dry correctly would be nice.",0
Works well.  a little slow to absorb.,1
I was looking for a good non-smudge eye liner.  I went into Sephora at the mall and an attendant showed me a couple.  We drew on her hand and mine with a few different ones.  We gave them just a second to dry and then tried to wipe them off.  This one doesn't MOVE.  It's wonderful to not worry about crease lines and such when you are working a long day.,1
"The shampoo has a string coconut scent, $24 for 6.7 oz and comes in a metal bottle. I use have used the Phyto relaxer, that I like a lot.

It bottle was damaged on arrival since it was in an envelope rather than a postal box.

The opening is WAY to large! I poured out probably a weeks worth of shampoo. A little goes a long way so slowly pour into hand.

Its creamy, milky, silky and feels gentle on my hair, not stripping it like other more harsh shampoos.

Just not a big fan of the strong coconut scent but I can get passed that.",1
"******Updated Review******
I have used this product multiple times since receiving my UV lamp. The color indicated on the bottle is very close to the color within it. I was not shocked there was a slight difference. There is a learning curve when switching from regular nail polish to the gel color system. The objective of the gel color system is to make each layer as thin as possible. If you fail to do that, you will notice wrinkling and puckering when you begin to cure the color. Another trick that you will want to use is to get as close the the cuticle as possible without letting the product actually touch the cuticle. It takes some time to perfect it, but after a couple of tries you will get the hang of it. I watched a lot of YouTube video on the best ways to go about it. The color looks great and will go perfectly with even the most professional work environment. I am now a believer and supporter of the gel color system. The color truly last for 14 days, I can even where the color longer if my nails didn't grow so fast. I consider myself an educated consumer, and thoroughly researched each system before I purchased anything. This is definitely a GREAT buy!!! You can't go wrong. I'm looking forward to my next purchase.

I just received my CND Shellac gel color today. I ordered it Sat and received on Wed. Not bad for free shipping. I'm still waiting for mu UV lamp and my CND Shellac base and top coat to come in. Once they do, I will update my review. It came in its original packaging, and I can't wait to use it!!!!",1
Normally I LOVE OPI!  Tried this color and it smelled horrible!  Not sure why but never had this problem with opi in the past.,0
"The shampoo did not do what I expected.  The directions on the bottle were vague. The directions stated to apply to damp hair and leave on ""some"" minutes.  ?????????",0
Started using this product last year in the advice of my aesthetician but had to pay $40.00 for the bottle. Worked well but hated to purchase again at that price. Snapped it up when I found it on Amazon.,1
Broke within one month and do not see any options to return the item!,0
"I have very soft nails and this is about the 5th item I've tried, hoping it would harden my nails so they wouldn't chip so easily.  I've used it twice so far and so far, no chipping.",1
Made my skin itch and also made it darker but I guess made bumps go away a little,0
Bought as a gift,1
I have very sensitive oily skin.  This powder goes on smooth and provides light to medium coverage. It doesn't make me breakout or irritate my sensitive skin. Pur makes great skin products.,1
"At a recent visit to my dermatologist, i saw a brochure and decided to purchase Nectifirm by a company called Revision Skincare. I paid $60 and followed the instructions to apply in an upward movement morning and evening. I have seen no difference in the appearance of my neck. In fact, prior to using this expensive concoction, I found that just applying my facial moisturizer to my neck area gave immediate results of smooth skin and less visibility of lines in the neck area. I would not recommend this product. And I really cannot fathom how Revision's website got before and after pictures....my neck and under my chin certainly had no change. Don't waste your money!",0
"I have been using C&E's Summer Hill lotion for years, absolutely love the scent and feel of it.  This is NOT Summer Hill, probably not even Crabtree and Evelyn.  Completely different scent, different texture, even different color - see the photo and you can tell very clearly it's not the same lotion.  Will not buy this one again.",0
bottle was not full - won't order from this vendor again.,0
"Disappointed  and confused
 I have used this product before and I think it is working well for me. Iam disappointed because it states on the bottle that it is 6.8fl oz. The bottle that I previously used is also 6.8fl oz and  is larger in length and in diameter than the bottle from Amazon. The price was about the same. To make a long story short  I feel I've been cheated and I find the situation utterly  perplexing.",0
Not really helpful to soothing my face (my face often turned very red in winter dry and cold season),0
"As great as some of these reviews are, this spray is honestly hit or miss. It does NOT serve as a setting spray, but rather as a ""refresher."" What on earth that's supposed to mean, I don't know, but it's branded to be some miracle hydrator for your skin. It honestly seems like a madeup concept to sell a product, and ideally is not worth buying. It smells nice and everything, but this is really just rose water put into a bottle.",0
work's great,1
Used with toothpaste & pre rinse (once daily) daily it has made my teeth smooth & white. This is the 3rd time Ive reordered & if you use just a pee size it goes along way. My dentist even mentioned how smooth my teeth were. Worth using but is important to use all three as a unit together.,1
Streaks bad .,0
"I love all of jack black products so this will be the only product I don't like that they make, for one reason only. I am a man, and this body spray smells like perfume. It has a very feminine smell.",0
Great product,1
Shipping was fast and the product is just what I asked for.  Its a great product for under-eye concealer for those dark lines under the eyes.,1
This is the best hot iron I've ever had. I love it! I own a salon and this is the one I recommend to all my clients!,1
"Lovely colors, makes eyelids burn. Going back",0
"This is a fake product being sold on Amazon the texture, smell and even color is off. I began to notice my hair was drier after using this for a couple weeks,

The one on the left (in my picture) is the real deal the one on the right is what came out of this bottle.",0
"Light and soft, spritz away frizz, straightens and smooths, adds a little shine.  Love this stuff, and less expensive here then from the salon :)",1
Ew,0
Love wen products,1
"Not very powerful, but it is light weight. Smaller motor equals less power. Good for what it is...wish I had spent the extra money for the better one",0
It does not smell sweet as described - in fact it smells terrible. I am completely disappointed in this purchase. I do not recommend.,0
Works quite well.  Very little residue.,1
"Very happy with purchase. Great hair dryer/ styler. Have been using using this product for a very long time. Just needed to replace the one I have been using almost 10 years. Great product, really lasts a long time.",1
Didn't keep my nails from peeling like the other OPI nail protector.,0
Make my baby had rashes in his body,0
"My first experience with the red shaving cream - nice light scent and quality lather in my brush.

I'll probably continue to use this or other proraso creams - no going back to drug-store stuff.",1
"I am constantly buying supplies and running out of space in my bathroom! Lately, I've been tossing products and seriously reading reviews. I'm very fair skinned, red hair and have an excellent complexion so I wear little to no makeup unless on photoshoots. I LOVE this product! I have only been using my favorite moisturizer, lip balm and this and this product truly looks radiant!
I do not know how it would appear on darker skin tones but certainly would be an excellent primer and/or highlighter. As I stated, I wear it alone and not as a primer (yet) I do add more to my forehead, browbones, nose, cheekbones and chin and it highlights these areas beautifully, on top of it being a thin layer all over already.
A very small amount is all that is needed. Not greasy or oily. It's a bit thick so 1-2 pumps is plenty! I''ll be using this as long they make it.",1
"Aubrey is a great mauve brown color. Zoya polish covers well and lasts, especially when combined with Zoya basecoat and topcoats. Thank you for making an excellent formaldehyde, toluene, dibutyl phthalate, & camphor free polish!",1
I really like the way this spray feels on my skin.  It's perfect for cooling off on a hot day.,1
This honestly didn't really do anything at all. 2 star just for the smell but even that didn't have any staying power. I used it for quite some time too just to be sure.,0
This product is just what I needed to fill in thin spots (caused by hypothyroidism). I will definitely order again.,1
Great product!,1
After seeing this product being recommended on youtube I decided to purchase one for myself. I like that it makes facial cleansing hands free. You are no longer transferring bacteria from your hands onto your face during washing. It washes off makeup great although I would recommend using a makeup wipe first and then using this device to clean off the remaining product to get the best cleaning. The silicon bristles make it more sanitary than some of the other face washing devices and I love that I don't have to pay for replacement bristle heads which really saves money. My favorite thing about this product is the battery life. I bought it at the end of October and it is now December and it's still running off the charge from straight out of the box. I charged it a little bit today before I leave for Christmas vacation and it was barely on the charger before the battery was full again. I really like this product.,1
I love it.,1
"Works really well, but I don't recommend leaving it on your hair very long if you have fine hair. Otherwise, it can make your hair a little greasy afterwards. I use this every other wash or so since my hair doesn't need much deep cleaning very often.",1
"I didn't buy this on amazon - I bought it at a local beauty supply store.  I have fine, thin hair and I know MO to a good brand so I decided to try their volumizing shampoo.  I find this stuff does the opposite of what it claims.  The oil in it gives the shampoo a gooey consistency that does not get much of a lather, so its hard to know if you've spread it all over your scalp.  The bigger issue is that its impossible to get all the way out of my hair.  After shampooing, I stand under the shower and scrub my scalp for several minutes but still, when I go to dry my hair, there is a heavy residue of oil in it.  I end up having to wash it the next day cause it is just so oily and weighed down.",0
"This is a gloss, not a liquid lipstick. It is gloopy and doesn't really cover well. Not really at all what I thought I was buying.",0
"I really like this aftershave.  It's soothing, has a distinctive, masculine scent that isn't overpowering, and absorbs nicely.  Unfortunately for me, it also causes me to break out when I use it anywhere near my mouth.  So, I'm having to change brands.  But, that doesn't mean I don't recommend it for others - it's certainly worth trying, but be aware that it may cause issues for a few.",1
"AWFUL EXPERIENCE!  Used curling iron for the first time on low heat and FRIED my hair right off! The second time I tried to turn it on, it no longer heated up. Must have been a short in the curling iron or it was defective. I'm out the money I paid since it was opened from the package & still don't have a working curling iron...Will never purchase Hot Tools again!!!!!",0
I tried this scent in Paris and it smell delicious. Shame on me for not purchasing it while there. When I came to the states I looked for it and found it on this site. I am terribily dissapointed because it smelled old.,0
This cartridge was definitely defective. Ive used many cartridges and this one gave me MAYBE 300 shots. All of the others (15+) Ive used in the past from various resellers have lasted far longer. Will not purchase from this seller again.,0
"My light brown hair can get too brassy in the sun.  I started using this last summer, and was pleased that my hair stayed it's normal color.",1
"LOVE the mascara, HATE the packaging tube which falls apart every time, so it's useless.  The tiny ring inside disappears, breaks or something so you the brush has no tension or scraping and is just a big mess.",0
Love this color,1
"This is the kind of sun screen that I prefer. You apply it under your makeup and then if you are going to be out in direct sunlight, you reapply it every two hours.  The ingredients are typical for Skinmedica products, very excellent ones that are healthy for your skin.  I like it very much.",1
I've used this a few times. Love the scent. It doesn't leave my hair hard. I would recommend.,1
"There is medium temperature, not only cool or hot, which i like a lot",1
"I am over 60 and have a lot of redness in my face.  This is a very good cover for daily wear.  It helps neutralize the redness (not 100 percent, but well).  It is light and does not cake.  The ""marble"" mixture of colors works well, does not look yellow, and can be worn alone or with blush, etc.",1
works better than an axe commercial,1
"This product is great. However, the shipper has consistently failed. The cap to the bottle has been so loose the last two times we ordered this that contents from the bottle leaked into the bag it was packed in. So we loose the product before we even get it delivered. This stuff is not cheap. So I give it two stars because the shipper can not get their act together. They cost me money.",0
"For some reason, it seems this product makes my circle appear darker.  For the price, it is quite disappointing.  I will find a different product to use.",0
"very pigmented, darker than expected but one little tub lasts a lifetime!",1
Thanks! Your,1
"Love the lipstick...beautiful color, wears well...the reason I didn't give five stars because of the slow delivery...",1
"To me it smells more like a fancy air fresher. It lacks a sweet vanilla note or maybe a bit of saffron in the middle in my opinion. It's sour and a bit powdery. I guess some people may like the idea of sour and powdery summer scent, then grab it, why not? But I prefer a little sweet and light (like fahrenheit 32), floral or aquatic type of scents for summer. This one is too sour for me.",0
"I tried numerous products, products people recommended.  My Aunt said she used this religiously for the last two years with the face wash, toner and moisturizer.  She gave me a bottle and I have been using it for the past three weeks and I've noticed the spots have lightened up.  I am so impressed by this product and will continue to use it.",1
"ITs easy to use and although the results take time,it does work. it's also good for protection form all thebfungalmtoes out there!!",1
"This is not a moisturizer and I wouldn't call it a serum.  It doesn't offer any protection from the sun.  What it does is help smooth out those little lines.  It's actually a rather effective primer, and that's how I use it.  After I wash my face, the first thing I reach for is a facial serum.  I use three different kinds, depending on the day and which bathroom I'm in at the time.  I'm a believer is serums and they are always the first thing I feed my skin after washing.  After that, I use a good quality moisturizer with a decent SPF.  After my skin has absorbed that, I use a tiny bit of this cream.  A little goes a long way.  To me it feels like it's creating a thin layer all across my face, absorbing just enough to equalize everything - fill in the gaps, so to speak.  Afterwards, makeup goes on with similar results as when I use a primer.",1
smooth but didn't take care of dry skin.,0
Best conditioner i have ever used - I have thin hair and I lighten it as well - this conditioner along with the Shea Shampoo from Philip B.  keeps my hair not only feeling smooth but also in great condition.  Worth money for me.  Can't use anything else now.,1
This item was purchased as  Christmas gift for one of my young adult daughters. She was quite happy when received it and since as indicated it works well for her. I was pleased with the prompt service. The product arrived several days earlier than expected in spite of the Holiday Season.,1
Very satified,1
"The distributor is sending a knockoff. The plastic is so cheap, and when i heat it up, the outer body overheats and is hard to touch. Babyliss products are NOT like this.",0
"My hair has never been more healthier!!  I have very fine, limp hair and I lighten it.  Since I've been using the Phyto products that last couple years, the strength has improved and my hair feels better too!",1
Never ever again ...in couple days of using this product my skin burning and red and I am in pain..,0
"Ordering and shipping process very good. The actual product was less to be desired. I had ready stunning reviews on it and how soft, supple and workable it made hair, especially difficult hair (like mine) to work with. I have coarse, brittle, wiry hair that I do color regularly and was hoping I had found a product that would take the place of the mulitple ones I use (serum, conditioner, gloss, shine and finishing spray.) This product however left my strands very sticky, stiff, and hard to work with. It felt I needed to wash my hair again and made my hair very difficult to style.
Unfortunately, money wasted for me. :(",0
Thanks for fast shipping. Perfect as always! My best wishes and recommendations.,1
"Does a great job when used in conjunction with the other products in the line. Otherwise, the results aren't super noticeable.

Note: per the product's claims, the scrub helps along with proper diet and exercise, I.e. If you don't exercise and you do eat solely McDonalds, it might not work like you would hope ;)",1
Worked until now. Turns on but no longer heats. Disappointed.,0
I did a lot of research to find a good cleansing brush system. The package was damaged and the product looked like it was already used.  Then when I installed the batteries and tried to turn it on.  Nothing!  Does anyone know of a reliable cleansing brush system?,0
This stuff helps but it's not a cure. It does dry out your skin so you need to use an oil free moisturizer. Unfortunately it's the best I have found so far for random cystic acne I get from PMS.,1
I have ordered this candle in the past and  what I received was not authentic or?  I received a refund.,0
"I know this product and love it--this is a great price, so I thought I'd give it a try from Amazon. First time I purchased on Amazon was in January 2015-using that bottle now and the cleanser is very watered down.  I'm using it, but not happy with the consistency at all.  I just purchased another bottle this month, and tried it-it seems nice and thick, like I am used to.  Guess I just got a bad batch the first time.",0
"This is a good product to keep the skin moist, and it is easy to use.  I didn't give it a 5 star rating because the sprayer needs to put out a finer mist.",1
Container came cracked and the content was spilled.,0
"Have been a long term user of this line. Completely fake product. Very bad odor. Tossed in the trash, it's a shame this is legal on amazon. Lesson learned, should have listened to reviews. This happened to me with a fragrance purchase as well on amazon.",0
"This did nothing but bad things for my oily skin. It caused me to break out around my cheeks and jawline, and not just small spots they were very noticeable. It didn't even help control my oiliness AT ALL. In fact I'm sure it made me even more oily",0
It took me 12 pumps to get it to come out. Once it came out it made a gross sound. I blended the color in and it was so gross looking. Orange and way too dark for my skin. I'm fair skinned and this isn't made for fair skinned people. Disappointed.,0
best creamy cleanser for sensitive skin,1
I really thought this would help my rosacea. At first it seemed to but in the end it was disappointing. It wasn't very surprising as it does contain SLS and that can be very drying. Having skin issues already that does not help.,0
It covers dark spot somewhat.,0
My mom loved it!,1
"Decent face moisturizer but doesn't work any better than cheaper creams. Doesn't ""erase"" wrinkles, not worth the steep price tag.",0
"I loooove this product I have very fine hair. I also color my hair and flat iron it .
I combine several pumps of THIS product and Healing  Strength Neem Plant Silk Serum and rub together. It gives me the shine and volume it needs,leaving my hair looking very health, without the greasy flat look. Ohh and love the smell.",1
"For the excellent price, it absolutely does the job.  I only don't rate it as 5 stars because I find it is not quite up to the level of some of the professional irons I have used in the past.  But as I said, for the price, I'm extremely happy with this iron.

The extra long cord is bonus!  Longest cord I've ever had on a flat iron.  Combined with the swivel, it makes using this iron very easy.  I also love that it is an analogue control and not digital.  Even on high end irons, the digital controls are typically the first thing to break.  It's so hard to find an iron with a nice, reliable analogue control.

My main negative comment is that there is no indication when the iron has fully heated to the set temperature.  Most devices have a flashing light or switch from flashing to steady or SOMETHING.  With this iron you just hope that you've let it heat up long enough",1
"For $30 the compact is TINY. Apparently it's 1 oz of product which is good. But this blush is awful and glittery. It's more of a blush topper/highlight than a blush. The glitter is chunky and does not look good on the cheeks. I wore this as blush and looked like a bafoon. 1 star for the admittedly small, but cute packaging and the second star because the powder is a perfect silky quality. Would be 5 stars if this was matte.",0
The product didn't work and looked like it was used. Packaging was impeccable but the product was in terrible shape. Returned without a replacement because I couldn't wait any longer without a hair straightner.,0
This was received with a broken dispenser. I was extremely disappointed when I opened the package and I could not dispense the product. Then I found out it wasn't returnable. What am I suppose to do with it now ?,0
"Probably one of my favorite cleansing cloths. Not a miracle worker, but great when you can't wash your face.",1
chemical smell,0
"I absolutely love this fragrance.  It is my new favorite.  Other perfumes i love are Opium, Samsara, Hombre Rose, Obsession, Oscar DeLaRenta.  I do not like very flowery perfumes, they give me a headache. I prefer earthy, warm fragrances.  I get many compliments when I wear this perfume.",1
It's good for relaxed hair. I got heat damage with this stuff on my hair. Now my natural texture won't revert back,0
Good smelling just not what I expected,0
"i read online that this was ""different.""  it isn't.  it smells like 80% of the cologne samples you find in GQ.  not a good thing.  if you are in this price range and looking for something that really smells nice then i suggest hermes ""eau d'orange vert.""  it's not cheap but it's a stellar scent, very special.",0
Didn't work on my hair!,0
"Bought this for my girlfriend as a refill for her last one. This one has a very heavy perfume smell. This one is listed as ""classic"". The prior one did not smell this way at all. It had no label about odorless but it mentioned ""Aromaguard"".",1
"Was heading on a tropical vacation where only ""reef-safe"" sunscreens (aka mineral sunscreens) were allowed. I'd already accepted I'd be ""fresh faced"" for the trip (aka not my typical foundation/concealer comfort level), but was not looking forward to the greasy face regular sunblocks always give my oily skin, or the white mime-face from mineral sunscreens. (Plus, chemical sunscreens always seem to make me break out afterward, even Neutrogena ones.) I found Coola Matte Tint on a blog reviewing mineral sunscreens and thought the BB cream aspect of it might make it the perfect thing...  Was it? Well, mostly, yes.

The coverage was not as concealing as I would have preferred, but it definitely helped even skin tone and make me look more polished/smooth, so I'll take what I can get. Plus, no zinc-y mime-face! (Although I am light-to-fair, so I can't speak for anyone deeply tanned, or darker skinned.)

The absolute best part, though, was the matte finish. It's amazing. It's a pretty thin liquid, a la tinted moisturizer, but has a super silky-powdery feel on the skin. I wore my regular moisturizer under it b/c I had read Coola felt a little drying (good tip, btw, even for oily girls) and was STILL crazy matte. Victory!!

Even after hours in the hot sun, and reapplying several times on top of whatever was still there, I was shocked (pleasantly) at how good it looked at the end of the day. And not a single break-out after a 5 day trip, which is unheard of for me.

I just bought one for a close gf going on her tropical honeymoon next month, so I definitely recommend it.",1
"Since switching to DE shaving I have found this product to be one of my favorites. I love the way this feels on my face, the menthol tingles but is not overpowering and it leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Unlike other soaps/creams that I have tried, there is no oily residue left on my face after I finish shaving. Proraso lathers easily and the tub has a nice shape and size that makes it possible to lather in the tub; personally, I use a shaving bowl. I have seen some negative reviews for this product that claim it is difficult to build a lather with this soap; I can only speculate that these people do not know how to properly load their brush or add water to get the lather to the right consistency. This is shaving soap, not cream. There is a cream version of this product that comes in a tube and probably requires less water to lather. At any rate, I find those claims unsubstantiated. This shaving soap provides excellent protection against nicks and gives the right amount of lubrication so that the razor glides easily over my face. So many things about shaving are subjective and dependent on skin-type and beard-type so this may not be true for everyone, but for me this shaving soap provides good protection and does not dry out my skin. An added bonus is that Proraso is inexpensive compared with other brands of soaps I have tried. I have three other soaps that I use regularly, but I do not enjoy any of them quite as much as this one.",1
"Great scent, really soft and refreshing, but doesn't really moisturize really dry skin.",1
Love My flat iron. Perfect for my short hair.,1
"Be careful, this cologne is a different color and does not smell like the real bottle from the dept store is it the same?  it said Eau De Toilette spray vaporizer on the bottle.",0
"I have read all the Amazon reviews and I am amazed that this product works so well for so many different kinds of hair.
Put me in the long, wavy, not-much-body kinda hair column......and mark me very satisfied.  I use it on wet hair before I blow dry/syle.
If I ever hear that this is being discontinued, I will certainly stock up -- that's how much I love it.",1
Great,1
Easy to use.,1
"I have owned two of these ... they last a couple months before the spring no longer works ... as in it won't spring back to hold the hair in place.  If I ever find another brand in this size, I'll be buying it.",0
the color was so different from the picture.  I wanted to have matte finish and that I got from the search.  it is pretty color but not what I wanted.,0
"Like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around. Its a larger amount than I expected. Ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps. They last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them. This one is very pleasant, very nice shave, lathers easily (I have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1-5 its a 2-1/2) and Im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation. I have a tough beard that grows in many directions and I would definitely recommend this soap.",1
"I've had problems finding colored mascara. I'm not crazy about blacks and browns. I have green eyes and purple accentuates green so I was always looking for a purple based mascara. While discussing makeup on a discussion forum, Kestergayle recommended Blinc because it worked so well for her. I ordered it and really like it. It stays on the lashes without smearing giving me ""raccoon eyes"" and I can remove it easily. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 is the brush. I had been using another product with a clump free brush and liked that aspect. Blinc's brush is not clump free, but the product itself is great. It comes in different colors not just black, brown and purple. The purple has a beautiful hint of dark lavender. Give it a try. I think you'll like it.",1
Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!! The colors are identical and the formula's great!,0
This smells fantastic! I use it all over not just my hair!,1
"This product leaves my face soft and hydrated. I really have nothing bad to say about it. It smells good, too.",1
"Arrived with out a top on and not in box, did not like that. Product seems to work fine .",1
Unfortunately it didn't work well for me. I had a few times to last a few days and a few times to last one day only.,0
Terrible waste of money.,0
"I had this flat iron for just over a year.  Worked great, no creases on hair.  Then the spring in the handle came out & the plastic pivot broke making it unuseable.",0
"Again, the product and expectations of Billy Jealousy did not come through for me.  I do not even have combination skin but I was initially pulled by the Green Tea aspect but sometimes my skin is oily and other days it is dry.  This moisturizer, even when used at night, does not provide the expected results.  I have been using these products for three weeks and no results. It looks like I have to go back to a simpler, cheaper alternative.",0
Package says free with purchase? What's going on? Leaves a very sticky mess and hair feels dirty.,0
"Received the product, but it looked as though it had already been used.  Couldn't really tell if the product is any good as there wasn't enough liquid in the tube.",0
"i noticed my nails grew a lot faster and my scalp became healthier, significantly less dandruff. and the two pack price is great because if you go on sephora the two pack is always sold out",1
The product has completely stopped working?? Not sure what happened??,0
"doesn't hydrate.
also may be a knockoff product as I've had these treatments in salon and they were lovely",0
"I purchased two of these dryers in February of 2013. Was initially very pleased with their performance.
They have both burned out in less than a year (keep in mind I have very short fine hair). Don't waste your money or time.",0
"not as good as other OPI products. not even for the first coat. can use anyway, but won't recommend to my friends.",0
"I'm confused.. is this the high def image that the 150"" HD flat screen Smart TV opens with? If so it's pretty disappointing. Would much rather see a high def eyelash curler",0
I ordered 3 bottles of shampoo and received 2 bottles w a bottle of conditioner. I didn't realize it was conditioner till i opened it. I don't use conditioner.,0
"An excellent product!  After some sun time in Hawaii without sunscreen, my shoulders were a little sunburned and I was certain that my skin would be peeling.  Not only did the cream prevent peeling; it also is an excellent moisturizer and has a light, pleasant fragrance of citrus and lavender.  I have received compliments on both my skin and the fragrance.",1
Very very good,1
I've used several pads and these aren't much different than any other brand. They do the job and work well.,1
"Whoa. What a swing and a miss. I looked at every hair product on Amazon and ended up choosing this one even at $17 a can. It will probabaly end up in the trash.

Pros:
Smells pretty good
Has a kind of cool look to the can

Cons:
First three ingredients are Petrolatum, Beeswax, Mineral Oil.
...yes thats right. This is vaseline for hair.
Need a bunch of Dawn dish soap to get off hands after grooming
Cannot run fingers through it and if you managed to I hope you have more dish soap around
Medium shine? compared to what, chrome? it shines like you have vaseline in your hair... because you do
Hold? It doesn't hold it clumps your hair together with vaseline which might sort of hold it in place as long as you don't live in a hot place... like New Orleans because then you just look like you ate pizza then rubbed the pepperoni on your head
The can is so wide... its like finding a place in the bathroom to store a vinyl record

After my second online pomeade purchase going in the trash can, the overpriced stuff my barber tries to sell me is starting to sound pretty good since he'll style it with one to show me how it works first.",0
"Product was all over the bottle, all over the shampoo bottle I ordered, and all over the box.....so I received a 1/2 of what I paid for. Other than that, the conditioner is fairly light which is what I wanted. Doesn't smell good like the leave in conditioner which is what I expected since it was called ""Milkshake.""",0
"My hair started to fall out after using this.

So now it is even thinner

The medicated scent of this is not fun either.

I do not recommend this at all!",0
I use this perfume for aprox 20 years and this one is not the real one. It is very light scented.,0
It really is great on my curly hair.  It makes it so soft and it smells really good too!  I put it on my hair after I get out of the pool to keep the frizzies away.,1
Drying lotion doesn't always dry my pimples out the puss is still there however when used on one of my pimples now there's a black spot mark left in its place. Honestly don't see the hype of it. The other products don't do anything either I feel.  I have a combination skin type and sensitive skin.,0
"pump nozzle is not working that well, after the pressing, it doesn't come back quick enough, have to pull it out. maybe the spring is not strong
enough.  or the shampoo is too thick
it takes 5-6 pump to wash the whole body, I am 5'8"", medium build, and shower water is kind of hard(ground water)
doesn't dry up the skin even in the winter time. cleaning ability is A OK.
scent is light and unique, depends on personal preference, I suggest to use it for couple of days and ask your loved ones to smell
your arm pit as a test.
price is OK",1
"Product works wonderfully!! Heats up quickly, glides smoothly and very comfortable to handle. Everything was as I expected. Great buy! Totally recommended.",1
It's okay.  It's quite dark so it doesn't  really suit my skin but might with darker skin.,1
Does not get as hot as my 1 inch. Does not work as well. Need to look at returning.,0
Very good shave soap for the money,1
This is the worst stuff ever.  It made my hair feel tacky and is hard to wash out  I did not see any improvement at all in fullness to my hair,0
This makes your hair like silk! It also adds shine. The only negative is that my style does not seem to last as long.,1
"Great stuff. Along these lines, I recently discovered&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juice-Beauty-Stem-Cellular-Cleansing/dp/B00GTESTLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B00WB864Q8 Ageless Organic Cleansing Foam</a>, and found it is not only all-natural, but it actually improves my skin.  The apricot kernel oil smells great, and has kept my skin feeling soft, smooth, and breakout free. I love it as a daily cleanser because of how hydrating and nourishing it is. Highly recommend!",1
I loved the price of this product and the way it makes my hair smell and feel.,1
"This mascara makes my eyelashes flat. Although , I do love that it comes off easily with water!",0
"Love these colors, go on well and stay on all day.",1
"I normally use a liquid foundation and then use this overtop and it looks FLAWLESS! I use a bottle of liquid foundation that only costs me $4.00 and this. This usually lasts me about a month and a half. Def worth the price! I used to use CoverGirl's powder after the liquid was applied. And my face would end up very greasy and you'd see the powder laying on your skin, which I did not like. This is a very light-feeling powder that covers all my blemishes! I have reddness that is hard to cover on my cheeks and mild acne (age 18). And this is the best I found found so far for full coverage with not having to use a ton :)

I'd DEF recommend this to a friend!!",1
I have really fair skin so this color looked weird on me,0
"Lovethis color. A nice soft lavendar, not neon or garish. Nice full brush, too..",1
Leaves my hair very hard and unmanageable.,0
wonderful,1
"I purchased this iron to try out since Babyliss products are often raved about, and I have to say I'm disappointed with this purchase.  This iron doesn't create a long-lasting curl as well as my Fahrenheit curling iron (purchased @ TJ Maxx; I highly recommend!), which sucks because my flat, fine, thin hair needs something that can hold the style.  Overall, not happy and wouldn't recommend this particular product.",0
Package was damaged and product arrived with 2 pumps remaining in th he container,0
This stuff is just as good as everyone says it is.,1
"The color does not match the picture (I compared on two different screens). I expected it to be a pearl with pink tint but instead it is a dull light beige that  looks like dirty white when dried on my nails. The item is not eligible for returns, so it goes  right into the trash can.",0
makes skin very smooth easy to shave,1
I love this powder however it arrived already breaking apart,1
I am choosing this due to its popularity.  But my skin get allergic.  I am not a sensitive skin.  That's why I am question about this product.  I am another type of mud from walmart.  It is better than this one.,0
"Excellent product! Recommend highly for intended purposes This is my 3rd purchase.
leor",1
"Not as strong of a ginger taste as I was hoping for. I bought it as an experiment. Nothing wrong with this product, but not to my liking so I will not be purchasing again.",0
This stuff works well! Will keep using it every time I paint my nails.,1
"If I could, would not even give it one star. Compare to the price, first it is just a sample size and exactly does what the Walmart samples 99 cents other brands do. Nothing special.",0
Best deodorant ever!! I stopped using the drugstore brand and started using an all natural deodorant that worked great for about 3 months. Then it stopped working so great and my underarms actually started getting very dark. I tried everything and started looking into $500 plus treatments at the dermatologist. I decided to try this first and Im so happy I did! Ive used it for two weeks and my underarms are no longer dark and my skin feels amazing. I also works better than any other deodorant Ive ever used. This was totally worth the price!,1
Yes very good.  Nice lather and easy to apply and thin out if necessary.  Though I switched to a Braun electricrazor and am never looking back!,1
My favorite stretch mark cream.  Although I have gotten some marks in the last month it works really well and even fades the marks I have.  My first pregnancy it worked the whole time no stretch marks at all! My first pregnancy I was skinny to begin with (115) and gained 40 lbs.  My second pregnancy I was heavier at 135 lbs and gained 40 so far with about two weeks left to go and had the first marks appear two weeks ago. Hope this helps!,1
"I am a long-time user of Nioxin Hair Booster and I am very happy with the results, especially when I combine it with the Anaphase shampoo by Ducray (French product readily available in drugstores in Canada).
Delivery was prompt and efficent. As I am very familiar with Nioxin Hair Booster I know this shipment was of the genuine product.",1
No I haven't seen any change i t seems it needs to be used with other Jan Marini products I will try with it's cleanser and see what happens please advise,0
You only need to use a small amount.  I love the light scent. I  It does not weigh down fine hair.,1
"Seemed old, doesn't smell quite right.",0
Great product and price,1
"THIS ONE WAS NOT GOOD. IT DID NOT WORK RIGHT FROM THE GET GO.  I SHOULD HAVE SENT IT BACK, BUT I WAS TOO LAZY.  WOULDN'T SPRAY OUT THE KERATIN OR PUFF BACK UP.  BAD BAD BAD",0
"Looks great, but is very heavy and slippery, so requires tight grip that makes precise shaving more difficult. I was unable to find a setting that gave a close shave without cuts. I replaced it with a simple, non-adjustable Merkur that shaves closer and never cuts me.",0
"We have a houseful of girls, each of whom has their own challenges with their hair.  We have one daughter with very thin, frizzy, wild curls that only become more unruly in our Pacific NW drizzle.  I have been using coconut oil or argan in her hair to help tame the wild 'do' but they don't hold a candle to this Curl Control!  Just a tiny bit of this product emulsified between my hands and applied in scrunching motion give us the perfect amount of definition in her hair.  With her hair, this product works equally well on wet or dry hair.

Personally,I had used the Curls Rock for years and then started opting for more natural (usually home made) hair styling products.  I found them to be smoothing and to define curls, but not in the way this does, where it seems to supercharge curly hair.  I definitely have much BETTER performance from this Obliphica Seaberry Curl Control in my own hair when I use it on towel-dried/damp hair.  Using it on dry hair did not yield the same results for me at all.  It was just more of a ""why bother""...I ended up dampening my hair and applying some more and that worked well.

This is a terrific curl enhancer or, as my one daughter says ""curl organizer.""  lol  She feels like this really helps ""organize"" her hair and she is a sucker for anything organized and tidy.",1
"This product did not work well for me. It was too heavy for my medium-fine wavy hair. It made my hair look greasy. I loved the smell, but did not like how it weighed my hair down. I would not recommend this for people with fine hair or medium-fine hair.",0
"My hair looks, smells and feels great.",1
This upon arrival and unable to use. Nail polish was thick as if it were old and should have been discarded before sale,0
Thick and lays on skin in an unnatural manner.  Returned it.,0
"Great product - quick dry, lightweight and not too noisy. My last hairdryer broke so had to get a new one, I have thick hair so was looking for something powerful. This definitely does the job! Only issue is that I saw it at Harmons for $5 cheaper and that was before the 20% discount so I paid premium.",1
"Chick Flick Cherry is a rich blue-red that makes me think of old movies and late nights in the summertime. This is the color of red I like to wear in the summertime with open-toed shoes.  It gives a little mystery, but flirty enough to say hello.  It is a versatile red that is perfect in the winter months as well.  I really like the darker, richer reds in the winter time as there is something comforting and cozy about the color.  If you are not one for blue-reds, this would not be the shade for you.  I put on one coat of polish and it is the perfect shade of red for me.  I don't think I would like it with a second coat.  I do love OPI products but this came with some of the bristles straight out to the side.  While they don't get in the way of polishing my nails, I do worry about product dripping off those stray bristles.",1
Love it.  Stays on and the color is neutral -- goes with everything.,1
"it smells so bad I can't even use it. I do not recommend the cucumber, maybe the unscented is better",0
i have used this cleanser for several years.  I absolutely love it. It arrived in plenty of time.,1
"This flat iron is terrible. The width is great, it heats well, but the plates don't even fully come together or align correctly when clamped down. Really poor made.",0
very bad smell...had to throw it away after one use...,0
"Not a big fan, the powder is very moist, not sure if it is supposed to feel like that but it leaves my hair feeling greasy.",0
"Maybe it's just me, but my hair just frizzes every time I try to use it.  Not what I expected for the money I paid.",0
Cheap looking and feeling. Not sure if this is the real thing,0
"I have mixed feeling about the balm products, but this exceeded my expectations.",1
"I heard good things about this brand so thought I'd give it a try. I have been straightening my hair for about 12 years. When I was first introduced to a straightening believe me with my hair it was life changing. I have very thick wavy hair and have always wanted stick straight hair. Its so time saving being able to iron it and it stays that way until I wash it. My first iron was a professional one my hair dresser bought for me (ten yrs ago straighteners were hard to come by, good ones anyway) to date it was the best one I've ever had. Wish I could remember the name it was Italian. Anyway the FHI iron is not worth the money. I could have straightened it better with a curling iron. It made my hair look a little straighter but very fluffy! I have a cheaper Revlon brand iron that I got once in a bind and it works waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than this one. So a word to the wise don't waste your money. Chi is a better way to go. Same price range and you get a much better result. Good luck!!!!",0
A few drops and the nail polish I loved is practically brand new again. Thank goodness cause I was not ready to part with my discontinued color. Great buy and lasts a loooooong time. :),1
Color goes on dull. Multiple coats makes it worse.,0
"I love, love, love WEN products! This replenishing mist is full of herbal extracts that are great for your hair and skin. This mist does a great job of smoothing frizz, making the hair glossy, and giving the hair lots of bounce and movement. Just use it somewhat sparingly on fine hair (I use 3-4 spritz for my shoulder length hair) or you might weigh it down. This product will not hurt your hair, it will nourish it.

Replenishing is the perfect word to describe this product. When my fine hair is being unruly, stringy, and dry I use this mist. Immediately after applying I think, ""Ahhh, much better. That's what I needed.""",1
"AHAVA products are exceptionally good! Amazing products! I gave 2 stars because the kit comes in very, very, very small size. Some hotels offer bigger small bottles of shampoo or shower gel. I was expecting a little more of these amazing products. The posting is somehow deceiving.",0
Clean and refreshing. It doesn't strip the skin of its natural oils.,1
"I couldn't be happier with the Age Defy Moisturizer except maybe if it came in a larger container for a cheaper price!  After using this product for over a week I can already see an improvement in my skin.  When I opened the 2 fl. oz. container you get a very light scent that is not cloying or oppressive.  The texture of the lotion is so smooth and spread easily over my face.  It absorbed quickly and I was left with a light glow.  It did not appear oil or greasy at all.  My skin feels firmer and I really liked how soft it made my skin feel.  With items I review from Vine, one of the elements that I judge them off of is would I buy it on my own after I used the sample, with the Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Moisturizer, I would definitely purchase more of the moisturizer.

The moisturizer is designed for most skin types, 20's and up and is effective for hyperpigmentation, dark spots, and uneven skin tone and texture.  You can feel safe with the natural organic ingredients of this product!",1
Good help in drying up new pimples.,1
"I had chronic dry lips, until I found this product.  No more chap stick.",1
Beautiful razor. I bought this when i first started wet shaving. Its tame and won't gouge your face . Its forgiving. Its not very effecient which is why I gave it 4 stars. Thats not a bad thing though. I feel anyone going from regular cartridge razor shaving to wet shaving should start with this guy.,1
Not crazy about it. The cream is so hard to come off the tube...I don't find it as moisturizing for people that have a very dry skin.. Nothing special about it..,0
"I wish I could give higher than five stars.
My doctor prescribed this and two other products, one oral and a topical treatment. for a bad facial bacterial infection .  The antibiotic and gel (cost of over $1340) had to be approved by my insurance company and sent to a specialty pharmacy in the DFW area, delaying treatment by two weeks.  However, within 3-4 days of using the face cleanser, my issue was resolved and I was able to cancel the prescription drugs.
The Elta cleanser online was exactly half of the cost paid in the doctor's office.  This is my miracle drug.  I now have it in every bath and shower and I'm never without it.  I wish they offered a travel size along with their other products.
Every teenage girl or boy with problem skin should be try this before buying expensive television products or prescription drugs with dangerous side effects.",1
"This curling iron gets very hot and makes very nice curls. I liked it so much I bought a smaller size too and was considering buying a medium sized one. Then one day while I was curling my hair, it popped and began to smoke. It no longer works. I expect a product like this to have a longer life that the one year I got out of it. It was MADE IN CHINA and so maybe I should have expected that it was not a quality product. In general CHINESE quality control isn't very good or doesn't exist at all. Lesson learned.",0
"I love this stuff! I can't really afford it all the time but it's great for ""Treat Yo Self!"" times",1
My second jar. I love this stuff. I use Bare Minerals complexion rescue in Honey Wheat and use this on top to set. My favorite!,1
I love and use this product every time I dry and/or straighten my hair.,1
"Feels great going on, looks flawless. However, I highly doubt its effectiveness against the sun. It's zinc oxide and titanium dioxide levels are FAR lower then the minimum recommended for sunscreen protection.

To be effective, zinc oxide should be about 15% and titanium dioxide around 7.5%. Coola misses this standard by a pathetic amount, with 1.8%zinc oxide and 3.2% titanium dioxide.",0
If you nails are thin or cracking try this product. The results are amazing!!,1
I'm a huge Essie fan and loved this color in the salon. Bought on Amazon and it was goopy and not the quality I've learned to expect. Something was off.,0
"When I receive this, the oil leaks everywhere. Disappointing",0
"The handle is only about 1/4 inch thick although it looks round in photos. It's thin, flat and has a terrible grip for arthritic thumbs; too painful to run the brush through my hair. How has this been a top seller and such a long-standing reputation (and so expensive) to have with such poor ergonomics? See photo for comparison to cheap brush that at least doesn't kill my hands.",0
Beautiful true one coater polish! I purchased this after a review on JessFace90's youtube channel and I love it. It's really nice to use when working with nail vinyls as it is a true one coater.,1
I love how it makes my nails feel much stronger & I wear it as my everyday polish.,1
It causes acne for my skin,0
"heating element works great, however, my hair is constantly caught on the screws. This is my second curling iron - same exact model/brand and the first one never did this.",0
Wasnt the real thing,0
I did not love the scent and it was a bit too greasy for my combination skin. It did not cause breakouts but it did leave my skin shinny. I think that someone with dryer skin would really benefit from this product.,1
"I have used this fairly regularly since I received it and have liked the results for the most part.  Here I am, however, 6 months later and it stops working entirely.",0
"I'm a bit of a product junkie...I'm always looking for products to help me age as gracefully as possible. I bought a pack of masqueology anti aging masques from another retailer who was running a promotion. I paid about $10 for 6 masques.

I excitedly used one as soon as they arrived. The masque was fully saturated in the anti aging solution and was easy to place on my face. After spending twenty minutes relaxing with the masque on, I carefully peeled it off and massaged the solution into my face and neck (just like the directions instruct). After the solution dried, my skin felt coated and a bit cracklely, but my normal redness was completely gone.  A few hours later, my face had to be rinsed so I could put on makeup. My skin looked exactly the same as it did before the masque.

My opinion is that these masques are not worth buying...better to spend your money on a good moisturizer or primer that will last and provide noticeable results. I will use the remaining 5 that I have and if there are cumulative results, I'll update my review.",0
"Was to light, loved it any way.what is your 2 darkest  colors?",1
"Flimsy and does not get me a clean shave, which as I am sure you assume was the overall goal.",0
"I like this palette,but to be honest I like my LORAC PRO palette more :)",1
"I agree with most reviewers, the curler is too short, so you have to go multiple times  across your eye to get all the lashes. I don't really see any huge benefit to this curler compared to other curlers. The short lever is not very practical and feels like its going to break. I do like the portable design, but I wish they'd executed it a bit better to make it work well AND be portable.",0
Aubrey is a beautiful color but much darker than the image. I wanted a pinky brown mauve and this is definitely plum. Will order another color lighter than what Im looking for and hope its right. Dont think its the screen; would have purchased in person as well (without trying).,1
"The description of the product is deceiving.  The box that this diffuser came in had Volare V1 written on it.  This diffuser is way too big for the Ferrari Volare V2 model.  If you have Volare V2, don't buy this diffuser.",0
"This is the perfect size to use.  Works great, but for me it only worked once.  Went I went to return it, they said couldn't get a replacement.  Too bad.  I will order a similar one from someone else.",0
"This has been my go to cleanser for years now.
However, as of the last few months, three purchases(one from Amazon, two from dermatologists) have had an awful rancid odor!
The expiration dates are fine, but there is something seriously wrong with the product.
It previously smelled refreshing and even a bit minty. Someone told me the ingredients have been changed.
I am trying to contact the company to verify and hopefully get a replacement.",0
I LOVE THIS STUFF. IT MAKES MY SKIN GLOW :),1
I have tried many different kinds of liquid eyeliner and this is definitely not worth the money. The line is comparable to water color paint in that it is not a solid black line. I had to go over the line a few times. It seems like the type of product that is expensive only to deceive you into thinking it is of high quality.,0
"Tried to return at the machine near my home and it wouldn't work
 Very annoying to try and return setting
 I need a. Return form ????",0
Highly recommend this product with a good badger's hair brush. It lasts forever.,1
I use this everyday and I love it! The price is wonderful compared to a high end spa. I used to spend almost $10 or 1/4 of an oz.,1
"This product has helped moisturize and smooth my hair. I still have to use other things, but I can tell the difference when I do not use it.",1
"This is a very nice cream, a little expensive, but it smells so good!!",1
"Very happy with product. It waves hair more than curls, the longer barrel is great for my hair.",1
good product.,1
this stuff is great! My local spa has it for double the price. Dont buy anywhere but here its the best price and all other places charge A LOT. happy,1
"I've had electro face treatments before and saw definitely improvement.  This device didn't deliver that.  I've used it faithfully for six weeks; before - after and interim photos reveal no improvement, no change, secondary viewers can't distinguish any timeline between the photos.",0
"Works extremely well at combatting the sun and preserving skin. Is truly oil free and will not cause your skin to break out. Smells nice and not strong at all. Completely unisex scent. Works well at being waterproof but not sticky and gross (like some other, cheaper, waterproof sunscreens).",1
My hair smells like I live at a bonfire. No joke. I LOVE my Rusk Biofoam for root lifting and I've never had a problem with their products before but this smells like a bonfire in a can. If you don't like smelling like burned hair don't buy it. (And it smells that way BEFORE I apply heat so that's not the problem. The problem is the product.),0
"this curling iron works well. Gave a noce soft curl at the ends but when I received the iron it was obviously previously used. It had streaks on the barrel from someone using it with hair product
I was in a time pinch so I cleaned and disinfected it and used it since I did not have time to send it back and wait for a new one but it was very disappointing to receive it used.",0
Received this blow dryer at the end of May and it is already blown the fuse. Frustrating!,0
"Love The Korres product line. Does exactly what it says brightening, leaves your face soft, non greasy. A little goes a long way",1
Great,1
I don't usually write reviews but I purchased this pillow case a little over 6 months ago and I am just not impressed in the least. I was searching for a silk pillowcase that wouldn't cause wrinkles while you sleep or terrible bed head in the morning. I came across this pillow case and it seemed so interesting I wanted to try it out.  There has been no difference from my regular cotton pillowcases except maybe this one feels even a little rougher on my face.  Today I will be purchasing a silk pillowcase.,0
NoNo! its a wet spray...leave sticky hair and not good. never again,0
I LOVE the product and have ordered it several times.  I HATE the new product design.  Only air comes out of the pump.  It has been several months and I still cannot access the product I bought.  I tap the pump to get the air bubbles out.... and I've been tapping for months now.  PLEASE change the pump back.  Giving up on it and moving on to another product.  Wish I didn't have to because the actual product is amazing... you just can't get to it.,0
0 STARS for the seller and 1 star for the FHI flat iron. Does not heat evenly. Results similar to $15 flat iron. Disaster of a transaction,0
This product dried out my hair.,0
"Seemed to be ""particles"" in the mascara that would flake off my eyelashes into my eyes. Not understanding the contents of the mascara.",0
"I've been curling my hair on a nearly daily basis for 30+ years, and didn't know it was possible to have strong feelings about a curling iron until I bought this.  Hate it.  It's just too big.  I have no idea why it needs to be that long and heavy.  Admittedly I have wrist issues, but I think it would be unwieldy for most people (I have to put a finger into the tip to shift some of the weight to my other hand), and hard to store in a small bathroom.  Also, the metal stand seems like it should be a thing of the past.  There are better designs.  Finally, it doesn't get that hot.  I have baby fine hair and have it cranked up most of the way.  (Though be careful on that, since other people have had hair burning incidents--it may just be the one I got.)",0
Great product! Used for several years. Like the results.,1
Standard product,1
"Not the same product delivered as shown.  I bought it specifically off the samples listed.  I liked a friend's ""miss charming"" and she recommended this.  It lists it as a scent included, however it was not included.  Very misleading and disappointing.  Some are good, others not so much.",0
"chipped right off!!  even with a top coat!!!

NOT WHAT I EXPECTED THAT'S FOR SURE, NEVER AGAIN!!!!

COLOR ALSO WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED!",0
"Absolutely not, it was a crushed mess upon arrival. Never was able to use. :( messaged about it and never recieved a response. Sad",0
Excellent!!!!,1
"Feel -5- Very cooling and refreshing. Helps calm irritation on my neck without being too sticky

Smell -3- Something between a lemon hard candy and lemon wood polish. OK for spring and summer, but probably in a drawer otherwise. Doesn't linger for more than a few minutes from my experience but strong initial burst.

Overall -4- Will probably continue to use through the warm months, but will be looking something with more subtle tingle and smell for colder months",1
I used it everyday for two weeks twice a day I saw. It a hint of repair,0
I have fine limp hair this product works great to give me some body.,1
Life-changing; permits me to be a vivid redhead at all times. Buy red towels though.,1
Mine didn't smell like the real thing. I think it was a fake or a bad batch. I gave it away.,0
"I bought it because of the reviews. I was looking for a product to texturize my hair when I curl them. While it does texturize a bit, I hate the feeling it leaves on my hair. It dries them out like crazy and is sort of sticky. It makes my hair look dull and makes me want to wash them right away.",0
"Never seen anything THAT small before. Tried it one time, and found myself confused about the rave people have with their reviews. It's just some droplets of God-only-knows-what in a tiny little bottle. Period. No effect whatsoever. And for that price? You've got to be kidding me.",0
Great product!,1
Fake alert! This is not Pureology. Smell is different. Bottle color is off. Doesn't leave hair soft + shiny like the real thing.,0
It did not look like it usually did. This was clear. The product used to a golden brown tint to it,0
"This polish is translucent. It would be perfect for the top coat on a french manicure. If you think you'll get an opaque pink, you won't.

Here is a photo of my nails with three coats applied.",1
Product on time and as described.,1
"I love this stuff.  It has done wonders for the texture of my skin, breakouts have completely stopped, and I love that I can treat, sun-protect and even out color all at once. It takes a little getting used to when it comes to applying - it is a bit thick. I use it on my bare skin without any serums or moisturizer underneath - it is supposed to treat my skin, and if I put other stuff underneath too, I wouldn't know which was working.

First I put a dab in different areas and blended, and that worked fine, but as I got more tan, I bought the Warm Glow, but it was a little too dark by itself, so I've been blending the colors for a perfect shade, so I put a dab of each on my fingers and mix them together and then apply with my fingers- and that works great.

I love that the product has clean, safe, healthy ingredients and I like the smell - I like natural smells and hate perfumes - they irritate me.  This doesn't at all.  At any rate, the smell dissipates quickly.

The formula evens out my coloring and gives the skin a subtle gleam.  I use a soft-focus powder on top, and I feel more than enough made up.  I can't imagine needing foundation on top of this, and I don't have the most perfect skin by any stretch of the imagination.  There are a few areas of my face I use a little mineral powder to conceal on top of this cream, but that's it.  I live in a dry climate and this formula is neither too greasy for my oily-ish t-zone or too drying.  It's perfect for my combo/aging skin, I think.

The only neg and the reason I subtracted one star is that the product is pretty thick, and the container/applicator is not optimal.  I've thought about what WOULD be optimal, and I think just a regular tip would be fine.  I like that the product is not contaminated by fingers, but the steel piece seems to cause the product not to flow as well, and it is a pain in the hiney to squeeze out, especially as the product diminishes.  I hope Juice will come up with a better applicator, but that won't stop me from buying this product because my skin looks great since I've been using it.

I use other Juice Beauty products - the Green Apple Cleanser (very concentrated, wonderful, best cleanser ever), the Stem Cellular Oil Cleanser (love it too, great for removing makeup), and the Green Apple moisturizer at night.  I am very happy with this simple yet healthy and effective regimen.  Grateful for organic products that are cosmetically elegant and work to keep my skin looking young and vibrant.  People always think I'm younger than I am.",1
"First the base, then 2 light coats and a top coat.  After that, once a week do a top coat.  The Power My Nose is a light, natural looking product that makes your nails looked ""finished"" - extremely professional.  Hides little flaws in the nail bed.",1
"Very nice color, dark burgundy metallic.goes on nicely like all other shellac products. As it ages and starts going in thicker, let the bottle rest on hot water for a few minutes before application.",1
I love this brand and swear by the smoothing cream. I don't like this at all though. Even just a dab leaves my hair feeling sticky and puts a kind of volumizing mousse feel in it.,0
"Not 100% sure this product actually works. I do not feel a tingle or see any instant results of dark lines after application.  I work the 'grave yard' shift and was hoping for something to not sure the lines and fatigue in my face.  I've read a lot of articles that express how important it is for an eye creme to reduce aging.  Therefore, I will continue to use the rest of the bottle until it is empty and see if I see any results, hoping it takes a month or so to see results.  I've had the product for a little over the month.  Will update if I see any changes and change the star level accordingly.",0
No other product compares.,1
Ordered  3.  2 were fine.... one was empty and the too was off.  Leaked all over the package.,0
"Whoever invented this tinted sunscreen was a genius. I've tried many sunscreens, but I just ended up with an oily face with white creases. This product goes on easily and covers well. It does not cause the skin to get oily. Finally a product I can wear.",1
"This is a very white color. It can be very striking at times.

The quality of Zoya polish is great. I NEVER use nail salon polish again and always bring my Zoya polish. The salon technicians always comment on the quality of the polish compared to other polish brands.",1
Doesn't clean well. Leaves hair oily. I had expected much more from this product. I will not buy it again.,0
"For some reason, this color does not go on evenly, even after two coats. I have tried this several times, same problem.",0
Great fragrance / gave it a 4 because It seemed to get black soot / something it has never done after 8 candles LUNA candle,1
"ehh, not to shabby.",1
"This gel has an intense aroma, and reminds me of Lagerfeld. It foams well and I like the bottle. My only criticism is the price, which I find almost twice as expensive as some other good brands, like Molton Brown, which I really like.",1
"I used to use the Shu Uemura eyelash curler until Sephora stopped selling it. After that, I tried many different curlers trying to find one that even came close to the Shu Uemura one, and the Japonesque one comes pretty close. I have very straight lashes and this curler curls them pretty well, and it's great that Japonesque will provide free curler pad refills for the life of the curler.",1
"This product is really too expensive.  The price per ounce ratio for the shampoo is not realistic. Just because it is extremely costly, does not mean in is going to do the job.",0
Stop don't buy don't don't don't,0
I love this product and the way it looks. It looks very natural on my lips and I use it to make sure they look full. The only issue with this item is it wipes off fairly easy. You need to reapply this frequently throughout the day. Other than that I love this product and highly recommend.,1
Smells good but it doesn't do the trick. Waste of money.,0
"I've used Biolage hair products for years, but this shampoo isn't their best. For one, it has a ""minty fresh"" scent that I'm not
crazy mad about. If I wanted to wash my hair with toothpaste, that's always an option. I necessarily must wash, rinse and
repeat with this product to get my hair clean, and then I need a hard core conditioner to follow. It is extremely drying to my hair and scalp.
It's a relatively expensive product so I won't buy it again, but your mileage may vary.",0
I was so excited to try the Tria. I'm the perfect candidate for laser hair removal (dark hair/light skin). I've had it professionally done in my full legs/bikini area and I was impressed with the results. I've been using the Tria on my lip/chin area religiously for over 5 months and have seen no results (sad face). In fact because you have to shave (no waxing or plucking etc.) I feel like you can see my facial hair even more now. I'm so disappointed. I REALLY thought this was going to be the answer to my embarrassing problem. Unfortunately I kept using it past the return window because I was praying it would start working. Now I just wasted my money on a product that didn't reduced/eliminate like it promised.,0
"THIS IS the size of your THUMB! Really, it is , if you have a big thumb then it is half the size of your thumb. This is a joke, it should be given as a free come on. I am almost laughing too much to be mad about it. too much trouble to return. Really people , what is going on here? Can you say RIP OFF?",0
great,1
"This is tiny piece of soap, hotel size 3x2 and NOT 6 x 5 x 4 inches as mentioned on the product description, which makes it overly expensive.",0
I love the flat iron.. it makes my hair smooth and silky and it heats up very quickly. The plates are small so you can get down close to the root. It has a very long cord that swivels.  My only complaint would be that it gets very hot on the outside.. once you get used to holding it a certain way it itsnt a problem.,1
shade is not what i expected at all,0
Great long lasting color,1
"I have used this product in spray form, which was quite easy and effective.  To use this you have to put it in your hands and work through your hair.  It might work with short hair, but not shoulder length",0
"I hate to write any negative reviews, but this product was a great disappointment.  All it did was make my hair heavy and oily.  It claims to be for fine to medium hair, but if your hair is fine, I would not recommend it.  Sorry, Obliphica, I had high hopes for this product.",0
"I expected more out of this foundation. I wanted it because it said it let's  your skin breath and still gives you medium coverage,  which, for my acne prone skin, sounded perfect. Well, The coverage of this is so sheer, like wearing nothing at all, but oxidizes to a strange very yellow color and my face got very oily throughout the day and felt pretty clogged. I would not recommend. There are better foundations out there.",0
"Extremely sticky and hard to apply even after intense emulsification. Might work on short hair, but with any length, forget it. Doesn't hold either regardless of wet or dry application.",0
Broken! After 10 uses the handle is completely broken. Cheap material... bending is not usual wear and tear of an item of this quality. It is not inoperable. See photos.,0
"Not worth the money.  Sure they look great when you first apply it, very shinny just like gel but that is where the comparison stops.  Lasted only a week before it started chipping.",0
"Used to be good, but I keep using the product an after a few months burns my face!!
Please be CAREFUL! It can irritate your skin and burn it and leave your worst than before.!!!",0
"this is a great product which I like but the one I received was very old, so old it was dark in color.  steer clear of this vendor...",0
"Dear Paul,

We've only been through one bottle together, but I thought you and I would be a 'forever couple'. Your Super Sculpt and my curly hair seemed like the perfect match. Everybody thought we looked great together. But I found out you've been hiding something from me. Propylene Glycol.  Really, Paul?!

I know it's an inexpensive ingredient, and lots of products contain it.  But I thought you were better than that. Who wants to put anti-freeze in their hair?  Not this girl.  I'm leaving you, Paul.  I hope you'll consider changing for me and all of the others out there who've fallen for you.  But until then, you and I are done. I really hate to do it, because my hair will really morn your loss. But I know it's for the best.

Please let me know if you decide to give up your anti-freeze habit.  You can do it, Paul. I know you can!",0
"While they don't perform miracles, these are good products.  They last quite a while, so the combo pack is a good value.  I ran out of eye cream after 2 months, but have been using them twice a day for three months and still have a fair bit of the neck cream left and the face lotion isn't empty.",1
Don't love this. Very blotchy and grainy on my skin- doesn't look natural,0
"It seemed like this product was old because first it was very watery even though I tried to mix it by squishing the tube back and forth, then it became very thick toward the end of the tube. The consistency was not like the tube I received from the dermatologist office.",0
"ok at best, far better masks available",0
works great. keeps hair from breaking off and helps with straightning. will buy again when i run out. worth the money and comes in a good portion. has a nice smell. does not leave your hair sticky like some creams do.,1
Excellent razor.  I love the chrome finish.  Very nice razor...a joy to use.,1
Too much like glue. I can't brush it through damp hair because the tangles get stuck with this mousse.,0
Perfect & does what it says. Straighten hair quickly! Great product and was delivered fast!,1
I bought this dryer back in October and the last month or so it has been HORRRIBLY loud while drying and sometimes the handle gets super hot. The cheap-o dryer I had before this lasted years and years. Save your money and buy a different dryer,0
"holds toppik fiber in place pretty good, not for rain or water though",1
"I love the smell, and this conditioner makes it easy to brush my hair, tangle-free after getting out of the shower, and leaves a nice lasting smell. Delivery was also fast and efficient. I took one star off because the bottle is hard to squeeze and takes a little extra effort to get product out.",1
"Have been buying the same hot air brush for years, great product",1
"I've been using this off and on for the past week and my skin just loves it.  I find it best used after my nightly shower.  It really gets absorbed and seems to lock in moisture. When I get up in morning my face looks smoother and more refreshed.  I also like that it isn't sticky or thick and seems to work with my skin unlike other oils which seem to clog my pores.  The marine oil has a faint herbal scent that is sort of more masculine opposed to a citrus or flowery scent which is not off putting and which I like.  I did try using it in the morning and let is soak in my face before using my BB Cream.  But this was a bad combination.  The oil actually separated the BB Cream and probably would do the same with any foundation or concealer you might use.  I think this is because although it is light there is still a oil barrier on the surface or you face that the make up does not mix well with.  So perhaps this oil does not completely absorb but locks in moisture, preventing it from leaving.  It might be a good idea to use my facial regime/ treatment such as cleaning, moisturizing and any serums first then at this oil last to lock everything in.",1
The product didn't really worked as well as I had hoped. Have used their Mela-D lotion with better results.,0
"I too agree with some of the comments on this board about the broken pills.
I have been buying this product from third parties through Amazon.com.  I don't think I will be buying again from ""Peter Louis Salon"" as capsules are all broken.
I don't think merchandise are stored properly.  How can you not?  These products are not cheap.  The product itself is 4 1/2 stars for me.

My suggestion to Amazon - please stock these products yourself before you start losing all the customers.  Extremely disappointed to say the least.",1
"Awesome product. Got a sample of this from Sephora and ended up loving it. This is a VERY large bottle, but with the salon pump it makes it very easy to use in the shower. Great for hair and body and the smell is very refreshing and does a great job of waking you in the morning! Excellent product.",1
Is nothing special on it... just a regular concealer,0
Prefer the smell of this product over some of the others I have used in the past and with one application I get some nice subtle color.  Apply a base lotion around places like knees and ankles to avoid extra orange discoloration.,1
I've used this product for years and love it but the pump stopped working on my most recent purchase (the only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars). There is still primer inside but no way to get to out. Very frustrating and disappointing.,1
This was a gift and she loves them. Very easy to use.,1
I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews.  I was disappointed in the performance.  It did not pull my hair through smoothly.  It left my hair dry with a lot of flyaway.  It also did not hold a curl well (as I like to curl with my flat irons).  I did not experience the shine I was used to with my previous iron (which sadly finally died).  I am returning this one and will purchase another of the brand I love so much.,0
I am a huge fan of this curling iron. I was previously using a 1 inch curling wand on my hair that is about 4 inches below my shoulder and the curls never looked quite right. This 1 1/2 inch iron made all the difference with bigger looser waves. I was able to curl my entire head of thick hair in less than 10 minutes and the curls stayed well. There are multiple hear settings for every type of hair which is nice and amazons pricing was cheaper than my local retail store. Highly recommend!,1
"From my wife, who has tested and used this product:

The serum goes on very smoothly. It doesn't feel like you need extra moisturizer with it although it recommends you put your favorite moisturizer over the top. It has a nice, light smell, and I've experienced no stinging or itching like I have with other serums. It makes your skin feel instantly smooth. I look forward to seeing some of the longer-term effects soon. the brand is a trusted one, and this is a good edition to its line.",1
"Very very disappointed. The product must be good, I can't tell coz I used it just once and because the bottle was defective. It leaked in my purse and by the end of the day when I reached out in my purse to use it. It was empty . The whole bottle leaked and got emptied in my purse. Very very disappointed. What's the use of the product if the bottle itself is defective. I didn't even get a chance to use it. And yes it had the cap on when I put it in my purse.",0
"The first time I used this hand cream, I thought the scent was too strong, and not one I especially liked.  Now that I've used it many more times, the scent has kind of grown on me, and I don't find it objectionable, although I'd prefer if it were unscented.

Despite that, this is a truly excellent hand cream.  It takes just a little bit to make my hands feel soft and protected, and that effect lasts!  I like that it contains NO parabens or phthalate.  It is not unreasonably priced, especially considering that it seems concentrated, so it doesn't take as much as with some more watery products.  It is not so thick that it is difficult to spread, just not watery feeling.  I can feel it on my hands, but they don't feel greasy or oily, just soft.

This hand cream is a keeper!",1
"I have bleached platinum Asian hair and was looking for something to hide my very obvious black roots in order to stretch touchups, since it's super painful. This product didn't do much to hide the roots, except make them look sort of grayish, and it did not match my bleached hair. However, I was looking through some photographs which I was using Color Wow on my parting, and I noticed that it made the black roots look a lot paler and less stark than in person. I think it'll work a lot better on someone with brown or dark blonde roots than someone with black Asian hair! I'll probably continue to use it for special occasions to reduce the starkness of my black roots.",1
Great flat irons!,1
"I bought this before from another retailer last year and it was heaven. When I saw it on Amazon, I was excited to add it to my order. I shouldn't have. The first time I bought this, the exfoliating side was a delightful emollient concoction, in a brown sugar color that glided on easily and left little bits of sugar on my lips when I used it. When the sugar bits were gone, a nice, moisturizing balm remained behind that left my lips feeling soft but not greasy. This one though, was an enormous disappointment. The exfoliator side of the lipstick was very dark in color, like a raisin, not a light brown sugar color. I didn't mind the color difference until I tried it. It was hard as a rock! I broke off a tiny piece thinking just the outermost layer had dried out and it would be soft inside. It wasn't. I tried it a few times thinking I might eventually get to the soft interior. This lipstick is like dragging a piece of gravel over my lips. Most unpleasant. I love Jane Iredale products and have always been satisfied with the quality. I don't know why this is so hard, or whether it's Amazon's fault or Beautylime's. To save future disappointment, though, I won't buy Iredale products again from either place. I don't think it's returnable so I've taken 24 bucks and thrown it in the trash.",0
"I wasn't very impressed with these flat irons. I have African American relaxed hair so, it's pretty straight and manageable. However, I had to set the heat higher because it wouldn't hold a curl. I ended up curling a small portion of my hair and then, finished up by using my go-to iron which, is the Nume brand.",0
I'm a cosmetology student and this is the best curling wand I've used.,1
It fried my hair. It doesnt protect that well. I had to stop using and bought something else,0
"I have thin fine hair.  I use this product and it gives me body and bounce without the weight.  With our humidity, this is so important !",1
Works great!,1
I have very thick hair so I think I need the gold plated style.,0
glitch issues,1
"Updated Review:
I have had the hair dryer since June 2013 and currently in May 2014 - wishing I had not bought this.  About 2 months ago I could no longer dry my hair on the HIGH setting with out it shutting off (because it smells like it is about to start a fire).  The middle setting is not bad, but for how much I paid for this hair dryer it should NOT be faulty with not even a year of ownership.  I have had ones from Target last longer than this one.  I am really DISAPPOINTED with this product.  I would not recommend this product to anyone - keep shopping.

Original Review:
My sister who is a hair stylist recommended this brand to me.  I have had this blowdryer for about 2 weeks now and I am very happy with it.  Most of the reviews said it worked for thick hair and not for thin hair, but what about medium hair?  Well here is a review for medium thickness hair!  It works good on it - so if you have hair that isn't considered thick but by no means thin hair this blowdryer will work well for you!

Also some reviews say that the buttons are in a bad spot and they shut if off - I haven't had that problem at all.  And I don't think that it is too heavy, actually it is lighter than my old one.

So if you are looking for a good hairdryer that is not too expensive I would recommend this one.",0
"Love the product. The pump on these bottles suck. Second time I have ordered from here and the pumps quit working in about two weeks. Pretty annoying. If I can't fix it, I'll have to put it in another bottle.",1
"Love it, love it, love it! The scent is heavenly and my hair just looks so much healthier after using it. It's a YES in my book!!",1
Feels awful. Feels like spraying hairspray in your hair . Would not recommend. I've used several other flat iron sprays that I definitely like better.,0
"While this item might be listed as Paul Mitchell marula oil shampoo and the packaging might say that, the stuff in the bottle was definitely NOT Paul Mitchell marula oil shampoo. I have been purchasing this shampoo for more than a year and usually purchase it from my salon or the Paul Mitchell website. Thought I would try to save a few dollars. What a mistake! The consistency was not like shampoo and it didn't even smell like the real stuff. I eventually threw it away because it didn't even clean my hair. Lesson learned. Only purchase from known sources.",0
Product is not the same as at the spa. Does not foam. Smells like hand soap.,0
I have sensitive skin and It gave me allergic reactions like red flare ups and It smells too strong for me.,0
"I like this curling iron. The only thing I don't like is that the grip gets hot as well. Burned myself a couple of times, but once I figured it out, I have had no problems.",1
"I take some responsibility for not looking closely at the ingredient list, however nothing could have prepared me for the overwhelming perfume scent of this product.  It smells a little like someone's grandmother and it's VERY strong.  I also have sensitive skin, so I ended up with a terrible red and blotchy reaction on my cheeks.  If you are sensitive at all to perfume in your moisturizer or several different kinds of alcohol then definitely go a different route.

I may not have written this kind of review if there had, at least, been any option to return or exchange this item, but once you receive the item, allergic or not, you're stuck with it.

If I helped one person be more attentive than I was when buying this product, I'll consider this bad experience a success :)",0
"I wanted to get on a more serious and structured regimen with my skin. I did a lot of research and came up with a few musts for men, which included a toner. After doing much research I arrived at ""Anthony Logistics For Men Astringent Toner Pads "", great reviews and right price. I didn't have horrible skin, just a few pimples here and there, but I wanted to have completely clear and clean skin. As soon as I started using this product, my skin got worse, actually the worst its been in years, massive irritation everywhere. Im not sure if it was the toner, stress, bad diet, all the new products I was using or combination of all of the above. Either way I decided to stop using it for a few days and in the past week it seems as if my skin is better than ever. Ill give it another try in a few weeks when my skin readjusts back to NYC and a new way of life, plus the current combo of products im using, I hope the second time around will prove to be better results.",0
"I so badly wanted to like this polish.  I am all about wearing pink in October, so I jumped all over this when Cut & Blow offered a good deal on it and its companion polish, Pink Works.  Imagine my disappointment when I tried to wear it last week.  This might be the worst formula polish I have EVER worked with.  Sheer but patchy, lots of dragging, and even after three thin, even (well, as even as I could manage), there were still unevenly-colored spots on my nails.  Such a disappointment.  If you're looking for a pretty pale pink shade - KEEP LOOKING!!",0
much more aggressive than the face shop's version,1
"I purchased this for my daughter as a natural alternative to the popular BB or CC creams. She had some acne she wanted to conceal. After about two weeks of use, her skin improved dramatically. While the foundation does have a slightly strong smell, she doesn't mind it, especially considering the benefits it has given her skin. Compared to other similar products, this is by far the best value I've found. You only use a little, but it gives big benefits.",1
After a day or two of using this product I thought it was gonna be great but I was wrong. Within one week I started getting cystic pimples on my temples and cheek. I continued using it for two weeks total and nothing changed. Definitely not worth the price if it causes cystic pimples which I have not had in 2 years,0
I love these colors very pretty and well worth the money,1
"They work, they really work!",1
"I LOVE this leave in conditioner! It makes my hair so soft and shiny, and it smells like sugar cookies! I've been smelling my hair all day.",1
Your face will look blooming after applying this product. Its very light.,1
"does not work. No difference between this product and any other regular, cheap conditioning from drug store.",0
"I have very curly hair; probably a 2c and 3a, and I grew up hating my curls since they were so difficult to deal with and so frizzy. These past two years I have been on a mission to let my curls be as natural and healthy as possible, so I stopped cutting it short and frying it with a flat iron and let it be. I bought this product because of the amazing reviews and I couldn't be happier with the results! My hair is about halfway down my back in length and I use about a dime sized amount of leave in conditioner on wet hair and work the product from the tips of my hair through to my roots and it makes my hair silky soft. I use this product in combination with curl keeper and when my hair is dry I have wonderfully soft ringlets. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants softer, more flexible curls :)",1
"Test your skin before using this! If you have any type of sensitivity to chemical sunscreens this will not be for you. As long as I didn't spend any length of time in the sun I was A-okay with this, but when I put the CC cream on my neck and chest, put on a dress and went out and about for a couple of hours this is what I woke up to the next morning. My dr. told me it's an allergic reaction to the chemicals when they are exposed to the sun. Some people get this and some, apparently, are more resilient than I am! The texture is lovely, but unfortunately it's back to a physical sunblock - I ordered Replenix, a matte, vitamin filled sunblock - and have been using this for a few days with no reaction (or white cast) at all.",0
"Skin feels good, no change in neck...still sags",0
ok,0
"This color is SEXY! Just when I thought I had enough pink polishes, Essie comes out with a beautiful hot  summery fuchsia and I am forced to get just one more.  While Bottle Service is part of Essies neon collection, I wouldnt classify it as neon because it isn't obnoxiously bright.  As with most neon polishes, this one dries matte, so youll need a top coat if you desire a glossy finish.  The formula is rich, easy to apply, with beautiful color pigmentation.  The color was fully opaque after two coats and has lasted a week now.  In regards to the actual color, I have very pale skin (no tan whatsoever) and this color looks fantastic on and doesnt wash me out like some bright colors do.",1
"Horrible cheap smell..like a dollar-store ""perfume"".  Does not smell like candy, etc.. just a cheap, fake smell. Stay away unless you're 6.  Also product arrived leaking. It was in a plastic bag, but still leaked into the bag.",0
It's not as great as it was described by others. It does have a pleasant cooling effect though.,0
"very difficult to operate have let a few other people try with no success, it not professional in my opinion",0
Good product though it doesn't look original,1
I bought this twice and it's awful. It smells like burnt hair + plastic. Don't buy it.,0
"I am really enjoying this Forea Luna Face Exfoliator Brush. I found I need to use a little more cleanser than usual, but it moves easily around my face, reaching most of the curves and dips. It does give my skin a glow, and although I have yet to notice a visible difference, it does seem like it should energize the skin and temporarily reduce fine lines. It definitely helps to slough away dead skin. The best part for me, is the vibrating massage! It eases tension and gives me extra motivation to exfoliate!",1
"This is a counterfeit product.  That's why it doesn't smell the same,  It is not Jimmy Choo.  It smells nice, but it's not Jimmy Choo.",0
Such a pretty pink with a light purple iridescent tint. I like it because it is sparkly yet subtle. And I can wear it for weeks and just paint over it for an easy touch up.,1
I love this lotion. It's all I use except it's very hard to get it out when it runs low.,1
Favorite hair product.  Smells delightful and adds sheen while it smooths,1
I am new to wet shaving and this is my second soap.  I got it because I wanted to try the sandalwood scent.  To me this smells more like real sandalwood than some of the other brands.  This soap takes a little longer to load but I am not bothered by it.  Good Stuff!,1
"It's FAKE and or diluted to utter worthlessness.  Mont Blanc sells this?  Well they should be ashamed.  As a response I am going into my local Mont Blanc store and purchasing the real thing and then returning this crap bottle to them.

The smell and frangrance is amazing but don't buy it here as it seems to be a bad batch version of the cologne.  Is Amazon aware of this?",0
This product works quite well at covering up thin areas . It is a little bit messy to work with but worth the cleanup. This is a product I will continue to stock,1
This  product did not work for my husband who is confined to a wheel chair.  It left his hair looking  dull. I expected more because of the price.,0
Product expired 10/2014. Cannot use it,0
"Bought this scent after reading posted reviews...
My husband likes it a lot...wears it every day",1
I only used it a few times.. then it stopped working. Called & it was just passed the 90 days.. what a waste of money!!!,0
Dislike this fragrance! PROPYLENE GLYCOL listed as second ingredient after water. How is that natural?,0
I wonder how people give it a good review. This product increased my wrinkles and burnt my skin. The texture is good but the quality is bad. And the prices it too much for the size. Believe me please save your money,0
Was not sure I would like the gray as my hair is gray with a light brown undertones. Gray works well when used in combo with light brown.,1
Great product. Shipping fees were excessive.,1
This stained one of my lips darker than the other and appeared as though I had drank kool-aid! Quite disappointed as most people saw good results.,0
Nice color.  it does not stay on all week like it states. It chips on the tips. It does coat your nails and gives some protection so your nails can grow.  I would not spend the money on this product again.,0
This is my go to favorite!,1
"Ive been looking for an eye treatment for years that would counteract the dark circles and crepe-y skin under my eyes.  These were issues Ive battled since my teens, but nothing has ever helped.  And now, at close to forty, I see the first signs of crows feet forming.  Youd think Id give up.  But I havent.

MEG 21 Bright & Firm Eye Treatment claims that its exclusive Supplamine technology, combined with anti-inflammatory ingredients and botanical extracts, significantly reduces the appearance of puffiness, discoloration, fine lines and crows feet. The eye appears more luminous and visibly rejuvenated.  It claims it can do this thanks to a process discovered through diabetes research. According to the box, results should be visible in four weeks or less.

I cant say I was excited about the MEG 21 Bright & Firm Eye Treatment.  Ive tried so many products at this point  drug store brands, pricey high end treatments, and even organic, homemade balms whipped up by a good friend just for me  and none of them have worked the way I needed them to or lived up to the promises on the box, website, or commercials.  I was pretty sure this, too, would be another product Id use one bottle of with no results and never go near again, and I was right.  It has a pleasant smell and a silky feel, but after a few weeks of use Ive noticed no difference whatsoever in the appearance of skin around my eyes.  Its still crepe-y, I still have dramatically dark circles, I have puffiness most mornings, and the crows feet haven't gotten any smoother.  We won't talk about the crinkliness when I smile, okay?  It didn't break me out or cause any irritation, but I did notice that when I woke up in the mornings my skin felt drier than it would with some of the other eye creams Ive used.

At the Amazon price of $63.82 for half an ounce as of this writing, I cant recommend it when it did absolutely nothing for me.",0
"I gave Burberry to my sister for her birthday, and she loves it!  She prefers a lighter, slightly citrus scent, and says this is now one of her favorites!",1
"It really does strengthen your nails! I took off acrylic nails and within a few days it felt less fragile, in a week I had my strong nails back. It works!",1
This smells so clean,1
"I really like it! It almost smells like the Banana Runts candy, and makes my skin look really good.",1
"Impossible to take off and looks quite childish, so not worth the price. Future buyers beware! i would not buy this again.",0
"in love borghese, but out of 2lipstics i got from this seller this was old, u can smell old greese from the lipstic.but even wothbbeing old, it stays well on.",0
I was disappointed in this product after I saw their ingredients.  Nothing but bad chemicals and Formaldehyde!!!  I bought the DeLore Nails organic nail hardener and nail polish dryer.  So much better.  Cannot recommend this product and will not buy again.,0
I bought my bottle at Ulta. Haven't noticed or seen a difference after over a month except getting a really horrible itchy scalp I can't seem to get rid of. I stopped using it because the shampoo makes it worse. No point in using it if I'm just gonna scratch my hair off. Also did notice long bunch of strands falling off when I wash it off. Don't think it's worth the price.,0
"Wanted a different smell for my boyfriend as opposed to everyone and their brother who wears Aqua di Gio or Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue, etc.. He has gone through 3 bottles of this and we both still love it. Very masculine with a sexy edge.. not soapy or musky. Very nice fragrance. Would recommend if you are looking for something a little less mainstream!",1
"I was really surprised at how well the BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA OIL FREE MOISTURIZER performed on my skin. I have combination oily and sometimes dry skin, but mostly oily in the ""T-Zone"" area, which is the forehead, nose and chin.

This moisturizer immediately absorbed into my face and my skin felt hydrated. It left no oily shine or texture and it doesn't feel oily or leave your face with a greasy after feel. And my face was pretty much shine-free for the rest of the day at work.

BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA OIL FREE MOISTURIZER has no scent and is formulated for men's skin. I don't know if I really believe that there's that much of a difference between guys' and gals' skin (research says that there is and men tend to have thicker, oilier skin than their female counterparts) but this moisturizer works much better than other ""oil-free"" ones that I've tried.

I'm also experiencing better performance from other BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA products like the body lotion, so maybe there is some difference in how a product is formulated and whether it's designed for male or females.

The only reason I don't give a full five stars is because the moisturizer doesn't contain a sunscreen so you'll have to do an extra step if you're going to be out in the sun at all. Also, for those with really dry skin, or patches of dryness caused by chemical peels or acne medication, this moisturizer won't be able to do the job on those areas.

I break out occasionally and use acne products that contain Benzoyl Peroxide, which my skin can handle most of the time, but every now and then the medicine will cause me to get extremely dry patches of skin and the BAXTER OF CALIF OIL FREE didn't help in those areas.

Other than those two issues this is a great product line for men!

PLUSES
* Safety Sealed
* Non-Scented
* Large ""Toothpaste"" Sized Tube
* Hydrating Matte Finish

MINUSES
* No Sunscreen
* Won't Help Extremely Dry Areas",1
good value,1
"Unfortunately I very much disliked this cleansing conditioner. I have never said this before in my life BUT this stuff made my hair look super oily. Normally Im adding oils and serums and conditioners to my hair, and I never have this problem. It leaves my roots greasy and my ends dry and crunchy. Its the worst of both worlds.",0
Doesn't seem to be an authentic Emi Jay product. The band does not have the same elasticity as other Emi Jay products I've purchased.,0
Too hard to use for a person w/short hair.,0
"I did a lot of research in eye cream before I purchased this. The reviews for this product vs other eye creams were better & I understand why. I'm 50 yrs old & I was getting darkness under my eyes & very dry, like flakey skin. I had need using an eye serum & eye cream. In the 1st 2 weeks of using this product the darkness went away & soon after that, the flakiness went away. I use this in the morning & at night. My local Bloomingdales stopped carrying it so now I'll have to stock up thru Amazon.",1
Love this stuff,1
"I'm on the edge about this. This feels great when I put it on, but it makes my face extremely oily. Chest and shoulders not so much, but it's a facial spray so I was hoping I wouldn't have this issue. Either way it smells okay, and is refreshing. If I were to rebuy I would shoot for the other flavor",1
"I bought it from Drugstore.com. Usually I love OPI polishes but with DS Radiance DS038 I have a love-hate relationship.
It goes on great and is almost opaque in one coat. I have always been a ""two coat minimum"" gal though. It looks phenomenal! What I do not like is the wearability factor. DS038 started to chip, peal, and rub off in just a day. Last photo shows the extreme wear on day 2. For that reason, I gave it 2 stars.",0
Love it!,1
"I struggle to find any curlers that work on my hair, I think this may because my hair is reasonably thick. These curlers only managed to make a kink in my hair, this may be due to the size of the curler. I'd recommend a really small curler size as they will create curls which hold longer, and you can style them to be big curls.",0
"This didn't work on waterproof liner like I was hoping. I usually use coconut oil, and maybe some olive oil to remove my makeup - I'm trying to steer clear of chemical removers. Coconut oil works pretty good, but I found I was a scrubbing a bit on my eyes than I wanted. Thought I'd try this natural remover, but it removed less than the coconut oil. I think this would be good for your face, just didn't work for what I needed.",0
"Excellent, Good, fast service!  I will buy Obagi again, my acne is now being controlled.  You'll see improvement right away.",1
Works great for my short straight hair.,1
I used the original Strivectin for about a year and I absolutely loved it. This new formula  is not the same. It is drying and irritates my skin. I can't even use it. I tried to initiate a return and never got a response from the seller.,0
"The hold is not great for me its medium to low. I'm Asian and I have stubborn thick hair.  The only thing that worked for me is baxter of California clay pomade, the hold is the real deal. I just wish this product had the same hold as the baxter.",0
"Did the manufacturers change the product?  THis is NOT the same product I have received in the past.  The color is a light pink vs white,  it has a very different texture, smell and feel than the previous product I bought... I am thinking this may have been a fake or mistake.  Has anyone else had this problem with this seller?",0
No impressed. Did not help my hair.,0
"Dear Amazon,

I don't know if you're aware, but Amazon has some misinformation regarding this product. The reviews from customers clearly say they were sold the 'alcohol free' version of this product, yet the photo Amazon displays here is of the normal (with alcohol) product.  As was stated by the review from T. Cobain: ""Got this as a gift when my son was born, and honestly, since it was alcohol free I sprayed it on his clothes some days. OH! How people LOVED to hold my baby. He smells so heavenly! ...""

The alcohol-free version is green tinted liquid and clearly is noted on the front of the bottle as alcohol free (sans alcohol). The photo Amazon displays is the purple tinted liquid, which is the normal, alcohol containing version.

I have had more issues with this product and returns/exchanges for this very reason of companies displaying a version of baby touch that they are not actually selling, and I ask that you please look into this and make it right.

Purple tinted= normal Baby Touch, 'with alcohol' version, and Green tinted= 'alcohol free' version (Please look up on the internet the alcohol free version to see the difference in the color of the liquid and the extra line of typing on the front of the bottle that indicates it is 'alcohol free').

Thank you~",0
"I have semi-curly hair already, Pureology just pulls the curls tighter and are skinny makes my hair beautiful especially with the Grey that's in it. I've been a user of Aveda products for over 25 years the B-curly product just doesn't pull the curls tight in the same way. I was introduced to the product about 2 years ago by a stylist at the time. I don't remember the last time I've gotten so many compliments on my hair. The only thing I don't like is because of the thickness of my hair and being abut shoulder it takes a little more to draw the curls tight and really make them pretty.",1
Gives nice lift at the roots but feels very sticky.,1
"I've never used a concealer pen like this.  It's pretty handy, but I haven't quite figured out how to use it as intended.  The brush is made of short bristles, kind of like a little paintbrush my kids use for paint by numbers.  You twist the base, concealer coats the bristles, and you paint it on, then rub it in however you wish.  It's easier for me to put it on my finger or my regular makeup brush and take it from there than to use the paintbrush.  The concealer is a nice consistency, not greasy, and it goes on smoothly.  I've been battling dark circles under my eyes for a few months now, and this helps me feel a little more ""awake"" at work.  I've got sensitive skin, and I've had no irritation with this.",1
Did like it and sent it back - too time consuming for the results.,0
"I love this lip color! The shade ""charming"" was exactly as I expected, a soft touch of color. I love the matte finish, but it does leave my lips feeling rather dry after an hour or two. If you apply any kind of chapstick on top, no matter how sparsely, the color will start to flake off.",1
Didn't see any difference,0
This product seems more watery than the last one I had.,0
Great,1
I have purchased many products from this line. Always I am pleased with their products. This particular cleanser says it effects pigment which it does simply that. I noticed the spots on my face disappearing within 2 uses. It leaves your skin feeling clean. I took away one star because I feel like it doesn't focus on cleansing as much as others. I still feel like I have some residue and buildup on my chin and nose which are difficult areas. To combat that because I like the fact that this almost tones my skin is I use another cleanser (cetaphil) prior to this to get ride of the build up in my pores then finish off with this. Works well for me.,1
"I LOVE moroccan oil, dries my hair quicker and smells amazing. The only bad part is you can't use too much or it will weigh your hair down!",1
Love the scent.,1
I don't know whether or not this really increases lip size but I paid less on Amazon than I would have in Sephora.  I can say it's very hydrating and gives my lips a nice plush shine.,1
I use the mouse normally. I thought this would be a nice alternative. Not. It streaks like crazy. I'm to the end of the tube and I never did get the hang of it.,0
"I chose Jane Iredale over Bare Mineral products because of the pressed powders. I found pressed powders easier to use and less messy than loose mineral powders. I use the color whisper on my olive skin. It stays on really well, especially after the spritzer is applied. I also have the bronzer to give myself little highlights over my skin to even out the color.  I liked the item enough to buy a second time despite the cost per amount.",1
"Love this stuff, so much so I just started ordering the ingredients and making my own.",1
"Get for my friend, she love it",1
not the easiest product to apply,1
"I have medium-fine, wavy hair, cut into longish layers. Rusk Thick really helps add volume without that ""crunchiness"". it's lightweight and not sticky and doesn't smell bad. Works for me! Thanks, Rusk.",1
"Smells wonderful, and that's about it. As a hair conditioner, I think it's next to useless. But to use the bottle up sometimes I mix it with a good conditioner so My hair has that awesome smell. Won't buy again, but I will miss that fragrance.",0
Best brushes ever.  Definitely helps smoothe the hair and minimize frizz.,1
Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!! The colors are identical and the formula's great!,0
Has that cheap lotion smell which is very strong.  Its also so light and watery it doesn't moisturize.  Not recommended.,0
Liked to way my hair looked and smelled,1
Goes on very streaky,0
This was a gift for Christmas. Sadly the Bristles bent in less than 2 months and was  only used a one to two times a week.,0
Great lip stick. Color is barely noticeable so I add lip gloss. Moisturizes lips. JI's products are top quality so I expected nothing less.,1
Bought one like this at TJ Maxx about 7 years ago. Loved it so much that imhad to have another one when it finally started going out. I was excited to find it on Amazon. Dries my long hair fast!  It is truly a great 2000 watt dryer.,1
WIFE LIKES IT,1
Do not like the smell at all. Color developed streaky and was unnatural looking. Did not last more than 2 days. Would not recommend.,0
"I'm with Ruth, scented water, literally like spraying water in your hair.  I've used loma products before (from the salon) and I'm betting this is fake.",0
"This is my new favorite concealer.  I love how velvety smooth it is to apply, and the fact that it comes in a little mirror compact is genius!  The only problem I have with it is that it is not a lot of concealer for the price, but I am willing to overlook this.  Great coverage and color, and it does not irritate my sensitive skin, start to look cakey, or clog pores.",1
My nail tech uses this on my nails.  So with my nails feeling so dry this winter I decided I needed something to keep them from being so brittle and breaking.  I put this on at least once a day.  Hopefully it will do the trick.  Seems to be working so far!,1
"I bought three of these for my husband and two sons, and they all thought it was terrific, just about the best shave gel they had ever used.  The only criticism came from my husband--he says that it's hard to avoid cuts because the gel is clear, and you can't tell where you've shaved.  (He's used to the foam.)  But my sons loved it, and like the fact that it's transparent.",1
"I first purchased this from Sephora, quite a number of times at that, but now I can find it on Amazon! It really keeps lips moist and conditioned, but be aware it has a bit of taste or aroma to it - camphor I believe. It is not at all noticeable after the first few minutes, and that is probably what makes it so good. No tingling, no strangeness. It also lasts a lot longer on the lips than the usual Chapstick, and definitely longer than expensive gloss.
This is the only lip balm I use. It is worth the price, and lasts a long time in the tube.",1
I went with this brand because my previous curling iron was the same brand and it worked wonderfully for years but sadly I had to retire it so that's how this one comes in the picture. I liked the size of the barrel but I could not get it to curl my hair. It wasn't getting hot enough so had to return it for another one and still the same problem but it was too late to return it by then :/,0
This drying lotion has become part of my skin care routine. Just apply it to a break out before you go bed and wash it off when you wake up. It's a must have!,1
Love this product!,1
When my package came no product just an empty box,0
"One of the best perfumes I own, and I own a lot.  Extremely versatile, and does wonders with one's chemistry.  I'm a man, but this was worn by my wife and it still worked extremely well.  Is definitely unisex.  The quality is noticeable, and you will be noticed with this one.  Definitely a winner!",1
"I really want to like this color because I love purple and I love dark nail polish.  This purple is very, very dark though.  I felt like it looked black most of the time and only looked purple under certain lighting.  Maybe I put it on too thick?  Who knows, it could very well have been my fault and I will wear it again because it is pretty.  I only wish it looked a little more purple-ish.",1
"the item was broken when I open the box, and the broken color is chocolate,It's so sad that light color is contaminated with dark powder.",0
"This really does do what they say. It calms the skin , takes out the redness . If I have a breakout and use a pimple medication that then inflames the surrounding area with peeling etc. this works great. My only thing is they used to make a healing cream and I liked that better because you left it on.",1
"Worked somewhat, didn't help with pimples or zits but did help with small white heads.",0
"It is good, but as the light moisturizer and refreshing use I want to give it throughout the day, I must say that I still rather the Evian Mineral Water Spray.",1
"My skin still feels oily by the end of the day after using this product, but it's better than other stuff I've tried.",1
"I think this is a great product and the smell is amazing, but when I got the bottle I ordered from amazon it had a crack in it and it all leaked out. I would suggest buying it in store...",0
Is this not the real thing?The smell goes away fast. Not very happy with it.,0
"Did not like it on my hair at all,sticky and did not work.",0
Worked well but I thought was way too heavily perfumed. Wish came in a no fragrance version. I try to keep fragrance away from my skin as it irritates it. Try to keep my brushes clean for this reason but the perfume negates the benefit of having the clean brush. Felt like the scent was so lingering that it would be irritating on my skin.,0
You could not ask for a more perfect sunblock! Texture smooths on nicely (but may not take the place of your morning moisturizer) melting right into your skin without leaving any white or reside behind. It contains a powerhouse of antioxidants to support free radical damage combined with a perfect outdoor SPF protection. It does not irritate my sensitive skin but I do need to apply a good moisturizer underneath. It appears to be just a bit drying when not layered with a good morning moisturizer. I love this product and it is now my go to broad-spectrum sunblock when spending any amount of time outdoors! I would use it daily but it's a bit expensive for daily use unless you need the SPF of 50.,1
This product did not burn my scalp. It was gently on the scalp.,1
Excellent product! Refreshing spray for face and body. Can apply on top of make up without running. Smells and feels great anytime of day.,1
"i was expecting a good quality product. however, this deodorant smell to strong,horrible. i do not recommend it to anyone.",0
The label was removed and the smell of the product was a lot different than when I purchased it in the salon. Fake ????,0
it's okay.,0
Excelente,1
Did not work. Had it for a month and followed instructions to a tee and no change. Not worth the price. Won't be ordering again. Crest strip work better than this.,0
Todo pigmentated very hard to apply,0
I've used several Avene products and been very pleased with them so I was really disappointed to find the sunscreen heavy and left a greasy feel on my face,0
"For the price, this is a very good hair dryer.  I believe the high volume of air tends to reduce the degree of heat which is important to me since I have thick, coarse and curly hair.  The heat and air speed controls are also situated where you can accidentally change them while drying your hair.  Overall good dryer for the price but I would rather spend a little more (and did after using this one twice) and get one that works with my hair.",1
It takes too long to cover the patches. The colour was too dark for brown. It was like black. It cannot be used for large areas of baldness.,0
"The product itself is great. I have dark brown hair and it doesn't make it look powdered. The packaging kinda sucks.  My first bottle worked great but the second one doesn't puff out anything.  I should have reused the first bottle,  regrets.",1
I like it.!,1
"My daughter love it!!! because she likes this
smell and taste! very lovely jasmine Mint!!!
I also like this !!!",1
"Nice polish, high quality.  Be advised that the color is very ""quiet"" and unassuming, a perfect neutral.  The gold flecks add gloss, but you can't see them on their own.",1
"It seems to do a really great job, but every time I use it I get red bumps randomly throughout my face.",1
"I purchased in July 2011 & had to replace it with another one in Aug. due to the fact ""THEY HAVE NO REFUNDS!!"" IT LOST SUCTION WITHIN SIX WEEKS!! They replaced it due to the fact of collecting my remaining payments even after the 30 days.. but guess what? my second one lost suction also within six weeks.. I talked to Barbara who's suppose to be supervisor there and explained I CANNOT KEEP REPLACING THIS SYSTEM EVERY MONTH IF IT DOESN'T WORK.. she explains you have a year to replace it.. THEN WHAT???? I have no system then... NUBRILLIANCE DOES NOT BACK-UP THERE PRODUCT, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T WORK.. I SHOULD HAVE LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS & GUT TO CANCEL MY CARD THE FIRST TIME AROUND.. THEY KNOW THIS DOESN'T WORK AND KEEP SELLING IT LIKE SOMEKIND OF GREAT SYSTEM.. IT MAY BE GOOD AS LONG AS IT WORKS, BUT THE SUCTION IS OUT BY THE SIX TIME YOU USE IT.. MY ADVISE, KEEP YOUR MONEY$$$ This product is TWO THUMBS DOWN!! :(",0
Purchased for my adult son. He likes them.,1
Who would have known something like this was so effective?,1
"In the many years I've been using UNITE products this is the first one I've not liked and I do not like it, at all. I have wavy/curly hair and even the slightest bit of this weighs it down, and with any other product it would take a ton to do that. UNITE missed the mark here. Went back to coconut oil for a good moisturizer for my hair over this. I wish I could return it. ;(",0
"So I got this product over a year ago, and it never really did it for me. I've got exceptionally fair skin (I have to get special makeup because it doesn't come in my complexion at drugstores), and dark hair. And yes, I used it according to the directions when I first started using it. I've since discontinued it, until I go and get some professional laser treatment. Honestly, I just don't think this product was made for someone to use first. It seems better suited for after you've already gotten some laser hair removal, and only use this for touch ups. It does not stipulate that as a condition for this product, however.

PROS:
-Easy to handle and hold; very sleek design.
-Charged pretty quickly once charged up, I was able to usually use it several times before needing to re-charge it (due to the fact that I was blasting small areas, not huge ones).
-Small and portable. If it actually worked, it would be a great size.

CONS:
-Used for months and months, and I didn't really see any results. Some lightening of the hair, but nothing significant.
-When I purchased this product over a year ago, it was over 4 stars. Now that it's down to 3, you should really take heed it that.
-Pretty loud zapping noise. Kind of made me feel weird using it, because it sort of sounded like a sex toy (LOL).

THE VERDICT:
I would never have purchased this product if it had 3 stars. When I was first looking into laser hair removal products, this one was one had one of the highest ratings. Something should at least have 4 stars, in order for me to even consider it. I'm not going to shell out hundreds of dollars on a so-so-product that doesn't really achieve the desired results. That's one of the reasons the majority of my product reviews are 4 or 5 stars--I onlt get products I think that I would enjoy. So I would recommend anyone looking at this product, to take heed with the 3 star rating. In less than a year, it's gone down one entire star. Perhaps if you're getting this as a touch-up tool it would be okay, but I really wouldn't spend the money to find out if that was its intended purpose.",0

"A nice, gentle cleanser that helps when your skin is reacting to practically anything.  Tissue or wash off with a warm wash cloth, it works well for minimal to moderate makeup removal too, if you double cleanse.  This will not take off any heavy or long lasting foundation (like Double Wear) or waterproof mascara, so you will need a makeup remover before hand for that type of makeup removal.  This and Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser are almost exactly the same, so for the price, I'd get the Cetaphil instead of this unless you are a die-hard Avene user.",1
"Item returned, was not pleased with product and service",0
Love it.  Have tried many products over the years. This stuff is the best by far!!,1
"Buyer beware: I have reason to believe these may be counterfeit products. I ordered 3 moisturizers by Elta MD through amazon for the first time to save time on shipment  (normally I order through dermstore.com) however I noticed the products are completely different. The ones I ordered through amazon totally dried my skin out, stung my face and had a weird smell. This is a red flag for an Elta MD product since they are known for using non comodegenic and moisture repairing properties without the use of harsh chemicals or alcohol...i recommend buying Elta products through actual authorized retailers like dermstore.com. you can even get 15% off on items by subscribing for refills.",0
I have ordered this several times. Was recommended by doctor.  Thought it worked at first. This last bottle provided no sunblock. Brown spots only got worse.,0
"The Emo Laszlo Hydra-Therapy Memory Sleep Maks literally, no pun intended, is like a dream.  This is an incredible product that will make your face feel and look fresh as a daisy.

I wanted to use this product several times before I reviewed it for Amazon Vine.  The package is attractive, and has a slick look to it.  Once I opened the container, I was slightly surprised-I expected the team to look a more neutral color such as white, off white or beige but this cream is very pink.  This substance also feels different from your average skin creams-there is no slimy residue or greasy after mess.  It actually feels as if you are touching fresh  skin.  Whatever the substance is, it is very moist, and feels like some type of water substance when applied to your face.

I've applied this mask liberally on my face for several days now.  One thing I must note, my package did not come with any directions for use, so I am hoping I am applying it correctly-at night to sleep in.  There is no need to wash off this mask in the morning, as there is no residue.  There wasn't a mess left on my sheets or pillow either that I noticed.  My skin does look the same, however this could only be because I've only used it for a few days now.  I like the relaxed feel I get from using this mask.

This is a mask that I would buy.  I don't normally use a lot of beauty products, but I intend to keep using this one.",1
perfect,1
Smaller than expected.  Doesn't do much; I'm still traveling with my full size.,0
This didn't work for me.,0
"I've had my Clarisonic Mia for about five years (I had asked my husband for it for Christmas) and have always loved how soft and clean it makes my face -- but have hated how it seems to attract mold and a funky smell.  Perhaps it's because I live near the coast, but the brush heads on the Mia start smelling moldy right away, even when I do weekly disinfecting of them and also properly rinse and dry the brush right after using.

I decided to ask for this Luna for Christmas this year, and love it!  I've been using it about three weeks now, and it leaves my skin just as soft and smooth as my Clarisonic did. I have sensitive, combo skin that also gets easily dried out since I use Retin-A, and using the Mia twice a day (even with sensitive brush heads) was too irritating.  I can use the Luna twice a day with no problems.

It's super easy to clean, and leaves my skin as soft as my Mia ever did. I also bought this from a beauty retailer that included the cleaning spray as a bonus gift, and I've been using that once a week to clean the Luna.

I haven't been using the anti-aging backside of it since I really bought this more for its cleansing abilities, and love how deeply it cleanses.  You just have to be careful to not use any exfoliating or grainy scrubs with this since they can damage the silicone nibs.

You also only need to charge this once every six months, which is great.

Also, I noticed that a few reviewers were worried about whether or not their Lunas were counterfeit, so it may be worth it to order it from a retailer that guarantees the authenticity of the product.  (I bought mine from a beauty store that begins with a ""U,"" and was even able to use a 20% off coupon for it.)

This is pricey, but it is something that I know should last me for a few years.  It's well worth it!

I will update my review as I use this more, but, for now, I love this.",1
Was not gentle in my opinion. I don't understand the love for this. It was a waste of money to have my skin irritated and way too much fragrance :P,0
"Strange smell, goes on the skin kind of thick and leaves a white residue.  It's kind of pathetic, considering it's only 30SPF.  Won't buy it again.",0
Great product,1
"This stuff is AMAZING! I wore it all weekend in the desert in 110+ degree heat. I didn't get burned at all and my makeup stayed on perfectly while keeping a matte look on my face unlike other sunscreens. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I was expecting 50 SPF. It's not 50, it's 30.",1
Will always buy from Amazon.  Great product with great results.,1
"The product cames very bad, because don't turn on... please check your products before send bad products.",0
"This arrived early and it does work. First, the picture of the product does not seem like the item you receive. The bottle is only about 3 inches tall and an inch in diameter, and it's very light. There are other products out there very similar, but this was a good price. The powder comes out fast and you don't need very much, but you shake a little in your hair in the flat parts, then use your fingers to work it in.  You can feel the rise in your hair, and it really lasts. If you're older, with dryer hair, you can easily get an extra day or two out of your ""hair do"" by using this. If you wash your hair every day, I wouldn't bother buying something expensive like this.",1
I have used this product for many years.  The first time I bought it in Paris and later ordered It online.  This is the first time that the product is very watery and it definitely is not as good as the previous Talika product.,0
Used for theater work ....,1
"The conditioner is awesome! But I would NEVER buy it from this seller again. What a mess! Some idiot put a half open conditioner bottle in a box twice its size. Had to clean the couch, my hands, the bottle, and my clothes. And now I can't get a refund unless I return the half-empty bottle.",0
Smells like some vanilla extract with beer spilled on it yuck .,0

"I like a full coverage concealer (my current fav is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tarte-Shape-Tape-Contour-Concealer-Light/dp/B00TUPJQUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tarte Shape Tape Contour Concealer - Light</a>) so I wasn't sure if this ""medium coverage"" would be enough for me. It isn't as full coverage as my Tarte, but it isn't as drying either, and the finish was a true medium coverage, which, for me, makes it perfect for more natural makeup days. It didn't crease or cake up (if set with a powder) and the yellow undertone added a much-needed brightness. I'm a fan.",1
"Even after about 5 coats, I still couldn't get this color to look quite right. I love Vinylux, just not this color. I'll be looking for another neutral. Also, it's closer to white than pink.",0
"I have never been a big fan of my wife or others wearing perfume because it was usually too strong. I also was not that fond of the scents that were too sweet and floral. I remember that while I was teaching, a certain perfume was being used by quite a few high school girls as well as my wife for a time. After a short time the scent would change. It took on the scent of stale beer. Needless to say I mentioned to my wife who then threw it out. I always got a chuckle when I smelled stale beer in my classroom as a student walked by.
I decided to order the Burberry Brit Sheer since my wife likes to wear perfume and I figured she could try it. I have found that it is a scent that I actually like. It is not just an overpowering floral scent, but has the fragrance of citrus as well as floral. This was an interesting scent for a wearable fragrance. No scent of stale beer.",1
This goes on white. Have to rub in good. Leaves skin shiny. Seems more like a straight sunscreen than a hydrating cream w/ sunscreen. Not very appealing for the face,0
"Like any other manufacturer, Ahava produces some outstanding products and some average products.  The sea salt line is exceptional.  The shower gel & liquid salt are great body products.  Because these products worked so well, I decided to buy the line of facial products.  However, claims regarding the quality of the facial product line by the manufacturer are unsubstantiated. To ensure that the Ahava facial products worked properly, I purchased the entire line of facial care products:  toner, mineral beauty serum, smoothing moisturizer, mineral skin osmoter, and so forth.  A couple of hundred dollars later, I saw absolutely no improvement in the texture or moisture level of my dry skin. In fact the smoothing moisturizer and mineral skin osmoter are very thick and have the texture of cold cream. I do not care for these thick substances on my face.  They feel heavy. Do not be mislead by the manufacturer.  These products work no better than the drug store brands. Stick with the body products where you can be happy with the results & justify the price.

FYI:  I read a similar review by another customer.",0
"I love Butter London polishes.  They are usually spot on with their color examples and the polish dries quickly, it is smooth and it certainly makes your nails stronger.  It too is rather pricey, but this is worth it.!!",1
Feels great its too early for me to say if it really work,1
not a good soap,0
This is a very very light violet color.  I was expecting something a little darker.,0
"I've used it for years. Your skin is baby soft afterwards. Wonderful for a date night. I use it regardless of whether I'm going to self tan. Paired with a good self tanner, you get MUCH better results. I've tried St Ive's Apricot Scrub, which is a very nice product and much less expensive. This product is a lot better.",1
"This didn't live up to my expectations. Stila, hands down, has the best liquid eyeliners. I've used them for years and they work so well. I wanted to love this one too, but it just didn't work for me. The beige, topaz color looks unnatural, like i drew on my waterline with a crayon. It has a pretty dramatic effect, and makes your waterline pop like crazy.

I use beige liners to get the ""wide awake"" look. But this just makes my waterline look a lot more dramatic than my lash line. It just makes my eye look unbalanced. I'd recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Milani-Brow-Eye-Highlighter-Matte-Beige-High-Glow-0-17-Ounce/dp/B00ILO7V8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Milani Brow & Eye Highlighter, Matte Beige/High Glow, 0.17 Ounce</a>.

I only tried using it once and I couldn't even get it spread through my hair. It's probably a great product but it's not for me.,0
"Jack Black's Thickening Shampoo is supposed to be unscented but it does have a mild scent of basil and citrus. The scent isn't something that I noticed immediately, I had to pause to try to identify the components.  Overall, it's subtler than most shampoos for men and it's an expensive tasteful scent.

The shampoo itself is thick, clear, and quick to lather. It was strong enough that I felt that my hair was well cleaned but it didn't leave me with the squeakiness that sometimes comes with the very strong shampoos (those that need to be followed by a conditioner).  I didn't need to use a conditioner after the thickening shampoo, which indicated to me that it was nicely balanced.

I haven't noticed a thickening of my hair volume as yet, but I've just been using the shampoo for a week. Overall, I'm pleased with the JB Thickening Shampoo but I'm still debating whether it's worth the steep price tag.",1
"This polish won't come off once applied, and it looks exactly as pictured. My only qualm with the product is that it is pretty thick when you're applying a coat.",1
"Does it work for its intended use to give volume to the hair... yes, but thats where the good part ends. Im not sure what is in this product but its not like a hair gel which comes right out in the shower. I shampoo and scrubbed my head four times in the shower and this stuff was still in my hair! It felt like superglue in my hair. You also cannot comb your hair after you apply this as the comb gets stuck in your hair. This is not something I would want to wear everyday because of how it feels and how hard it is to clean out. I would not suggest getting this product.",0
Too short.,0
Product is too glittery,1
"This 5 pack doesn't contain much toothpaste, especislly for the price.  Good if you want to try the flavors, but seriously a bad deal.  I likemy Arm & Hammer toothpaste for whitening much better and it's a much better price.  I didn't feel the Supersmile toothpaste made my teeth feel clean enough.  The tangerine is mighty tasty though.",0
"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1
Very hard to use. Trying to return both of them and I cannot. Not very happy with this purchase,0
"This toothpaste has a pleasant texture and mild flavor. I think the ""burst"" is a bit of an exaggeration! It's a nice change from the overwhelming mint flavor of other toothpastes, and I can tell the difference in my teeth when I use it consistently.",1
"If you have dark circles under the eye, you will love this product. It covers and last all day long.",1
"Well, I'm an idiot.  I thought I was buying the 2.8 oz version of this product, as I have in a store, since it was the same price that I have paid for that size.  I didn't notice it was 1oz, so this tiny bottle is highly overpriced.  Having one is fine for travel, but I certainly wouldn't have bought THREE of this tiny size!!!",0
"it also melted my hair off within seconds of using it. ive never experience hair melting before, so either this is way to dangerous, or.. way to dangerous.
RETURNING NOW.",0
"I've always been the type to purchase a cheap blow dryer to save money.  Once my cheap one shot sparks at my head, I knew it was time to get a new one.
This dryer is fantastic so far!  I think it's very reasonably priced and not much more than the cheapy ones.

I read a lot of the reviews before I made my selection.  One issue was the weight of this dryer.  It is a bit more than my previous dryer but that one was very small.  To me, having weight means it's quality.
Another issue I read about was noise.  I thought this dryer was extremely quiet.
I also read people being a little disappointed with how hot the air is.  My hair is thick and it took less time to dry.  I don't think you necessarily want it to scorch your head.  It got the job done quicker at a lower temp to help save my hair.
What I like: soft surface coating, smaller nozzle for focused air, removable filter for cleaning, and I LOVE the results.  My hair is thick and dries out easily.  I always had to blow dry and then straighten in order to calm my hair down a little.  This dryer eliminated most of the frizz and I was able to style it and not straighten it, cutting down on time to get ready in the morning.
The reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars is because of the buttons.  There are almost too many different settings spread apart so it was hard for me to change them with one hand while doing my hair.",1
i had purchased this straightner after reading all the reviews about it.its supposed to be this amazing flat iron in which cases tourmaline flat irons are the best.well i have wavy long indian hair and this straightner did not even do justice.it took me forever just to straighten my hair and not only that it left my hair in a poof.im the kind of person who loves my hair to be flat if im gonna spend an hour straightening my hair.i would not recommend anyone to buy!!!,0
Not a fan at all. I read all the reviews and it really is a curling iron you either love or hate. I have shoulder length hair and I thought it worked horribly. My opinion is that it probably works great on long think hair. If you have short hair don't waste your money.,0
Just Awesommeeee!! I loved all the items included in my *Luxury Beauty Box*.,1
Yes,1
My daughter used this for a service trip for Peru.  She said that it worked great.,1
"I've returned the brush because the power cut off as the cord swiveled, so there was only power about half the time.  It's really cheaply made.  The plastic bristles do not grip hair at all, which is a problem for me because my hair is short.  I have fine, thinning  hair and a shortish A-line bob with a lot of layering, and need the brush to straighten and shape (add volume and turn the ends under).  This brush sort of worked as a hot comb, but not much more.  On high heat, the plastic smelled terrible.  I wouldn't want to wrap my hair tightly around such cheap plastic - I would be afraid of damage.  I'm going to try a more expensive brush with a ceramic barrel.  On the plus side, it was easier than my usual struggle with a brush and blow dryer.",0
I bought the slapped color which looks more aqua and brilliant in the photo. It is not that color it is teal.,0
"The vinylux polish itself is great.  It stays on for a whole week, no chips!  It also drys fast.  The problem is the image for the color ""Decadence"" is clearly a different bottle.  Decadence is a RED polish. RED RED.  Not what I wanted.",0
:-),1
"I didn't check before my purchase but the sunscreen filters used are Octinoxate and Avobenzone, and Octinoxate degrades the already-unstable Avobenzone and none of the other ingredients suggesting that they're present to stablise Avobenzone. I purchased this for sun protection but there is little guarantee that it would do its job. Otherwise I enjoy the mint flavour, it's moisturising and not much lip balm is dispensed by the packaging (so it'll probably last a long time). I will use it up but won't repurchase.",0
"I used it three times but it didn't help at all, instead my skin is getting worse. Many pimples are coming out on my face!!! I don't know if I use it in the wrong way or is it really not a good product!!!",0
it is nice and silky but not very moisturizing if they have a dry skin. works great on normal skin but doesnt help for dry,1
"Ill be honest, I only bought this because my teenage sister said this was a hot product. I like it, don't see the huge fuss though. It smells nice and is refreshing for a few seconds after spraying it. I mostly use it on my makeup brushing/sponges when I want to moisten them for powdered makeups. So it does serve a purpose.",1
"Short life span.  Seldom used (4_5) times because I am trying to hold back on using heat in my hair. Had almost a year and when I plugged up today, the light didn't come on or heat up. Spent over $100 on it and definitely didn't get my money's worth. The temp. Dial is also hard to read. Disappointed and unable to return. Nice packaging and good reputation that's why I bought it, but I am extremely upset that I spent so much and unable to return or exchange.",0
"Beware, color is not as shown in picture . Color looked more like studio white. Did not look pink at all.",0
"The scent is almost like a vanilla scent and the best part about it is that it washes off easily. From pompadour to slick back to combover, layrite is a good product for hair.",1
"This is my second purchase of this product. I kind of hoard lip products, especially ones that are supposed to moisturize. This is the only one I've found that makes a difference in a couple of days. If I remember to use it a couple of times a day for a couple of days, my lips are smooth and soft (during winter, even!). If I forget, they start to crack (gross, I know) and peel (even worse)! I keep this in my purse and bought a second one for back-up that stays in my night stand. If you're desperate for smooth lips, try this.",1
"In want to start by saying I love Elta MD products.  I have used the brand for years.  I've been unable to find the barrier renewal complex locally so my only choice was to purchase it online and you can't purchase it directly.

This product would have been great if it wasn't EXPIRED.  The smell was terrible.  I tried using it 3-4 times but the smell was so terrible I ended up tossing it.  Complete waste of money.  I wish I could describe just how awful the smell was.  I ended up using my husband's face lotion to get me by.

Again, Elta MD is a wonderful line but only if it's not expired.  So gross.",0
"I previously purchased this shampoo from a local barbershop and it worked well.  Although the bottle is the same, the shampoo received does not appear or work as the one from the local retailer.  This shampoo leaves your hair oily.  It feels like a different or substituted shampoo.",0
This product is the perfect weight and does not make my hair too greasy or stiff.  Allows for natural styling with solid hold.,1
"I was using NutraLash MD, which works wonderful but it dried my eyes, so I decided to change brand to give a rest to my eyes...

Grande Lash does not work, it does not make nothing to my lashes. I'll go back to Nutra Lash MD",0
"Seems to work pretty well although it's a little hard for me to tell. I haven't been back to the stylist since I bought the product to ask them their opinion on the health of my hair, but I do believe that it works. I actually use this product after my shower and apply a dime sized amount to my hair, almost like a leave in conditioner. I've tried using the product as recommended on the bottle and didn't see any results. Be careful not to use too much! It will make your hair heavy and greasy looking.",1
I sure hope it works.,1
Didn't work for me . Threw it in the garbage .,0
I ordered the 8.5 ozs. I received the 6.5 ozs. I am very dissatisfied with my purchase. I will not purchase again.,0
"Natural looking tan. Does not splotch or streak. By far the best self tanner Ive ever used! The exfoliating cream and moisturizer are excellent products, as well. All 3 have a very nice, light smell. I was very pleased with this kit.",1
"Like most of the other reviews say, the scent doesn't last that long once you've put it on. Other than that, it's great. The smell is refreshing but not overpowering.",1
Does not moisturizer the lips at all,0
THIS PRODUCT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING...I BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT BUT THE PACKAGING LOOKED VERY CHEAP AND THE SOAP DRIED OUT DUE TO ITS EXPOSURE TO THE AIR.....IT CERTAINLY WONT BE A GIFT AND WHETHER IT GETS USED OR NOT REMAINS UNCERTAIN. RARELY DO I FIND THIS TO BE WITH AMAZON.,0
It has paraben,0
"Does not have the staying power of the one that i bought for her from a brick and mortar store near our home and she agrees too.  But hey, what can i do but keep it since i have no other option!",0
Not good. It started with a small to at the seam and tore all the way down the side in just a few uses.,0
This is a nice non-greasy broad-spectrum sunblock that goes on easily. It has a nice matte finish that evens out my complexion. Definitely recommended.,1
"Nice change from using soap!  At my age I'm not looking for a fountain of youth but I do like the way my skin feels after cleaning my face with the product!  Just as an aside, I do use the Konjac Sponge as part of the process.",1
"Love it, a little greasy but wanted something with zinc and non chemical sunscreen.",1
"Loved the texture and the glow, but is a little drying.",1
I have been using it for redness on my neck and chest two or three times a day. I leave it on no longer than the recommended 10 minutes for it can be drying. I think I am seeing some lightening of the redness after three weeks of use.,1
"I like the product, but I always get confused where the expire date or manufacture date is?",1
Product had expired and the pads were so thing that they were unusable.,0
"First I rec'd order and it was damaged.

Co.did replace with the wrong item' (and again the whole thing started)

Co.replaced with correct item in a smaller size & that was damaged.

I JUST GIVE UP/and cut my loss.",0
"I have been using this oil for two years now, but this one looked different.  The smell and even the bottle wasn't the same as the previous one I have use.",0
"This dryer is heavier and took longer to dry my hair than the 15 year old dryer I was replacing. I hate it. Also, the on/off button is right where you hold the dryer, so it's hard to use it without turning it off by mistake. Very annoying. I'm sending it back.",0
Bought at a fraction of the cost my salon was selling for. It curls very nicely and I like how cord twists with your turning to curl. Gets hot to curl quick. Works nice for curling my Caucasian daughters super thick mop top that won't usually hold anything but natural beach waves she was born with. Does georgus pipe curls on my African American daughters mixed hair texture and also hot enough to quick curl my 2 year olds pony tail ends or braid ends for added style.,1
It was missing the nail file and the nail polish remover was half empty.,0
"Seemed much more runny than a lotion as in the past. Was beige and runny, instead of creamy lotion and cream or white colored. Was thicker lotion and not watery before.",0
Wasn't impressed with what it promises.  My polish did not stay on any longer by using this product.,0
Just like the tube from the salon!,1
"This has been my go to cleanser for years now.
However, as of the last few months, three purchases(one from Amazon, two from dermatologists) have had an awful rancid odor!
The expiration dates are fine, but there is something seriously wrong with the product.
It previously smelled refreshing and even a bit minty. Someone told me the ingredients have been changed.
I am trying to contact the company to verify and hopefully get a replacement.",0
I am a regular user of la roche posay and this is a better product that the hydraphase serum. This is more moisturising and felt very comfortable on my sensitive skin,1
Smells good to me.,1
"I just started using the Crepe Erase Full Size Body Duo, Intensive Body Repair so this review is my opinion of how the product works, smells and feels. The first step is the Exfoliating Body Polish, it has a slightly gritty feeling that melts away as you mix with water cleaning away old dry skin away. I use a rotating Japanese style soft brush to apply, it foams up and leaves my skin feeling fresh. It has a citrus scent thats mild but pleasant.
Once you finish exfoliating apply the Intensive Body Repair Treatment, it hydrates and revitalizes my skin as its worked in and leaves my skin looking alive and fresh! So far I do see my skin looking better, after all that work I should hope so. If I see an improvement over time I'll update my review. Its worth a try so I'm willing to keep treating my skin.",1
I love The Art of Shaving products and the After-Shave Balm was what I have been needing for several months. I didn't want to pay the retail price and P&G had what I needed for a price I could afford. Thank you.,1
My wife tried the product and it didn't work on her acne.  She doesn't have bad acne but annoying pimples pop up on occasion and this product did nothing.  The seller was quite nice and promptly refunded the money so that is the reason for 2 stars.  There were no side effects or bad effect....just no effects on the pimples.,0
My middle finger caused a hole in the top after about 5 uses.  Not cool.,0

My guess is the fragrance caused it.",0
"This device lacks the following, in comparison to Sciton and similar brands of professional machines:
The pulse duration is between 125 to 500 milliseconds and it only delivers one pulse, instead of the recommended three pulses that is normally administered by modern professional machines.
The output wavelength cannot be altered.
The light guide is too small, and is not rectangular such as those used in a hand piece attached to the machine.
It is not compatible with any cooling substances, such as ultrasound gel. This only causes the contact sensor to be blocked, making it send flashes eratically.
It appears that this device uses audible cues such as beeps and buzzes. As such, it would be great if Tria were to implement an accessible feature so that a blind person can tell which setting the device is set to by the pitch of the beeps, instead of having to risk getting burned.
The product comes with a USB cable, but I was not able to hack into it to change its parametres.
It would be helpful to study the technical specifications at the back of manuals to see if it meets the requirements compared to other products.",0
"Our favorite soap, gave it to daughter and 3 daughters-in-law several years ago and I buy them refills every year!",1
"LOVE this ""Davines Love Smoothing Shampoo"" !!!!!!  I will be ordering it over and over as I need it.",1
"Light color, wish it stayed on longer. Great taste!",1
Love this stuff. Worth every penny.,1
"Wonderful product!  It takes off EVERYTHING, even  my most tenacious waterproof mascaras and eyeliners.  No stinging or burning, and better, no oily residue!  I'll buy this again for sure.",1
"This cream did nothing for me. Usually every moisturizer benefits my skin at least somewhat, but this product had zero effect. It smells very lemony which I did not mind at all. Save your money and take a pass.",0
This straightner is great!! I have coarse hair and it straightens ur really nice! Not the real deal but it's good!,1
"This product works great on my hair which is super thick but straight. My Mom recommended it to me, raving about the smell. I think it smells like men's cologne which is not my favorite scent for a hair product but it's not bad.",1
I love Jane Iredale cosmetics. This was to be an eyeliner but was way darker than I expected. I only use it for really dramatic eyes.,1
"No mascara is particularly easy to apply.  I find the wand a little large; perhaps I will get used to it.  Also, it takes a couple of times around before the lashes are as coated as I want.",1
"The product arrived in the required time, but it said the product was new and it was previously open, didn't had the protective foil that comes under the cap it had a regular tape on top of the cap. Since it was unsealed they shouldn't sell it as new, anybody could have used it. It was dissapointing.",0
Perfect travel,1
"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1
I bought this color last year and get so many compliments! Gelato on my mind is a Tiffany blue color. I use Essie gel topcoat and it dries very fast. I'm so happy I can still order it here on Amazon. It goes well with anything I wear.,1
"huge fan of blinc mascara, however, ordering thru amazon, u take a risk of old inventory. Mine arrived completely dried out and empty tube, so sad for a high end product.",0
"Was not as excepted!,",0
"Comes as stated. Buyer beware, the bottles are incredibly tiny. You are better off buying a full bottle of perfume.",1
great!!,1
It didn't work on my course curly hair. Maybe it's for more thinner hair.,0
Doesn't stay on for 7 days like it says... I even bought the top coat,0
"Y'all, this is calamine lotion! There should really be a giant explanation as to how this is not calamine lotion at like 5 time the price.",0
I am satisfied with my purchase overall.  It's a great curling iron and is just as described by the seller.  I'm terrible at doing my own hair and especially when it comes to using a curling iron so I had to get used to using a different one but it works very well.  It also received in the described time frame and was packed well.,1
great simple fast,0
Broke within 30 days.,0
Beautiful came within a day and a have. Mirror intact. Simply beautiful  colrs. I believe the real deal. So happy.also cabana boy blush little creamy little powder love the color on my fair skin!,1
I was really disappointed with this one. I usually use L'Or&eacute;al tan wipes which I like. I figured the original Tan Towels would be even better. A complete waste of money. I like the quality of the wipe but I don't think there was actually any tanner contained. I am very pale and it didn't change my color at all. I returned the product.,0
Horrible. Doesn't get hot anymore. Tried to return it and I missed the deadline by one day. What a waste of money.,0
"very disappointed with the product , I used Kaboki earlier and that is far superior product . As this was cheap , I thought I would give a try ...
but very very disappointed ,Never will buy this nor recommend it to anyone .",0
I thought this was a little drying.  I did like the smell of it and I'm not one for fragrance!,0
"I have used two of these since I was introduced to the Meaningful Beauty line. It was the only product I really felt made a difference to my skin so rather than ordering a subscription Amazon lets me order the one product I like even if it is more expensive than if it was purchased in a kit. After a few weeks my skin was clear and glowing. After a few months I started to see a halt or reversal to any sun damage (I am 28 years old). It leaves skin feeling soft and healthy and repaired and I swear by this every night and morning before adding moisturizer. It is light, not greasy, feels like it isn't even there but it definitely works some magic. I wish it was more concentrated with the special melon.",1
it works better than anything else I've tried. my neck looked firmer and softer and less like a turtle. really!,1
Don't buy it. Gets tangled a lot and hard for long/thick hair. Might be fake too.,0
"Absolutely love this product however what was shipped to me didn't work whatsoever ! So basically spent money on a product that I can't use and cant return! NICE.. it doesnt spray, not even does it attempt to spray!!! I looked to see if its clogged and its not!! Complete waste of money and time waiting for this product!! ** BUYER BEWARE **",0
I'm not sure which ingredients affected my skin but my skin reacted with redness and irritation. I didn't break out in a rash or hives. It was just irritated and went away once I removed the product and washed my face.,0
"This is my favorite eyebrow mousse. Very natural, but I still need to fill in a bit with a powder as mine are getting a bit sparse as I get older.  The mousse blends and finishes off the look.",1
"Have been using this for a couple of years, it does whiten my teeth and it leaves my mouth feeling very fresh.",1
Stuff is great. No 2 ways about it.,1
"So so so disappointed with this product. I read all the reviews about how insanely hot this tool gets, and figured I may have finally found a curling iron that can handle my thick hair. WRONG! This tool doesn't get nearly hot enough. I have thick dark hair, but it's not nearly as thick as some of my Asian friends (I'm white). This will give my hair a slight curl, which falls within the hour and leaves me with really limp and sad locks. I might look into the return policy because I wanted to give it a while to see if it got better but it hasn't. This was a waste of my money.",0
"Finally the key product I have been looking for. It adds so much grip and texture to my hair. It makes styling and teasing effortless. It absorbs hair oil so if you don't wash your hair everyday, it still looks good. If you do wash your hair everyday, it will give you the ability to have that third day grip with clean hair. Love it!!",1
Effective but will burn eyes,1
"This item did not heat!  Total waste of my money, too inexpensive to bother returning for refund.  I will not purchase this brand again.",0
"Smells right, scent gone after 90 min. What's the deal? I suspect it is extra old stock.",0
This stuff smells awesome. I work in a salon and every time I use it people ask me what it is.,1
Even though it is supposed to be unscented it still has a little bit of a smell but it does not smell bad at all. It is actually quite nice. I got it as a present for my boyfriend and he really does not like it. He feels like it makes the shave worse and that it made it harder for the razor to glide on his skin. I thought it would have been the opposite because its oil but he refuses to use it. For the money I put out on this product I wish it would have worked better for him.,0
Very small container. Don't notice much difference.,0
It didn't really do anything for my pre-existing ones which it said it would but it did lighten the color of the newer ones which time would've eventually done.,0
the best hand cream with fresh smell,1
"I have a severe case of KP and this is one of the few treatments that reduces the inflammation and breakouts.  It took about two weeks (daily use) for me to notice serious results, but I decreased my use to three times a week, which helps manage this issue.  Significantly reduces ingrown hairs and redness, along with the unsightly ""chicken"" bumps.  Since I do have a severe case, it does not remove all bumps, but it has pretty darn close to at some points.  This is my liquid gold and I can finally show my legs!",1
It's okay .... does not remove as much of my cuticlel as I expected.  Would not order again.,0
"I have a different set of rollers -from another brand- that I bought years ago but haven't been able to really use them because the clippers would never hold the rollers.  These stay put, get hot super fast and give you a great curl.  I have short curly hair in a bob style. I will use these to get a different look when I don't want to flat iron it",1
good product,1
"For the price and name, I expected better. The powder is not soft at all, and doesn't go on smoothly.
I would not recommend this product",0
Worth every darn penny.,1
This spray made my hair tacky and sticky. I had to go out and purchase it from that company direct.,0
"Not only did this stuff not make my hair fuller, it made me loose more hair making it thinner. And the foam made my hair greasy. It was horrible. I couldn't wait to use it all up so I could try something new.",0
Excellent transaction and product,1
"Not a fan of this product! I LOVE EltaMD's UV Clear SPF46 and expected this product to live up to that, but is a miss for me.

As someone with acne-prone, oily skin I love that EltaMD's products are geared toward that skin type. However instead of being light and hydrating, I find that this moisturizer is super siliconey feeling and just sits on top of the skin (leaving a tacky shine that doesn't rub in).

I've had far better results with Neutrogena Water Gel/Clinique DDMG type of products.",0
"Do not purchase this product if you have sensitive skin!  I used it for about a week and my skin feels like leather and as though I have a chemical burn.  I cannot use any moisturizer because it feels like it is on fire due to this product stripping my skin.  This was recommended by my dermatologist,  but is certainly not a good product for everyone!",0
my money poorly spent,0
"Not impressed.  Nothing in the packaging indicated to use more than once/day as someone else said.  Trying 2x/day now, but not expecting any difference.  RapidLash, even though it no longer contains the magical ingredient, still does a better job at once/day.",0
Flaky mascara! Not impressed at all,0
I have used this for years to take off the shine and it works great.,1
"This did not help with Friz, tangles or anything else
Was not able to return",0
it was a gift and there are no complaints,1
Its just smell okay . All my t shirt with white colors yellow now that part .,0
This product did not prevent my face from burning which is why I purchased it.,0
"Smells nice but after the shower, not much spell left. Not really moisturizing but doesn't cause any problems either. Was good to try it out but there are other better jasmine body washes out there.",0
"The scent is just as I remembered.  It is very light, but I wish the scent lasted longer.",1
"This is a nice eyeshadow set. There are four colorspale pink, light pink, light brown, and darker brownand they all have a little shimmer. They're easy to apply (though you need your own brush or applicator, since this set doesn't come with one) and have stayed on for me all day.",1
"This product was recommended by a plastic surgeon that I consulted.  I noticed that the deep lines around my mouth were more shallow.

It works well, but won't work as well as a face lift.",1
"I received this product November 2, 2017, it is now March 16 and it does not work any longer.  The one I had before worked for almost 2 years.  Obviously the product isn't as good as it used to be and it appears that it is too late to return the product or exchange it!",0
"These are my absolute favorite! I love all Noodle and Boo products, they smell delicious and make baby's skin so soft! I use their baby powder, too, and baby hasn't ever had a rash.",1
"Hands down, the best eyebrow product I've ever used.  Looks very natural and has great staying power.",1
"I just bought this color and tried Infinite Shine for the first time. I am blown away! I had to come and leave a review.

Pros: it's a thick polish that is very easy to manipulate. It's INCREDIBLY shiny- I have been doing my own gel nails at home with a gel light for years and this polish looks the exact same as when I do my nails in gel. It dries fast; I painted my nails with the 3 steps and 30 min later it's totally dry. I also love the color. It looks a lot like You Dont Know Jacques.

Cons: None yet! I will check back in to see if it truly lasts the 7-10 days as advertised.

Update 11/1/15- Sadly, the product does not last that long. I've tried two separate colors and it only lasts about 3 days before it starts to chip. Definitely better than a ""regular"" top coat, not nearly as good as my gel nails at home.",1
"This is a heavy cream that leaves your face feeling a bit tacky, so if you don't like your skin feeling sticky, you won't like this. I don't like having it on my face, but I went ahead and used it anyway. It has a mild fragrance that isn't too bad. I have a sensitivity to fragrances, but I can handle this one well and the fragrance dissipates fairly quickly anyway. The price is a bit on the high side but a little goes a long way and it does seem to plump up your skin nicely. After showering, the tackiness was gone and the skin was still soft and not overly dry like it normally is after I take a shower. So far it hasn't caused any acne or rashes on my face. If you don't mind going to bed with a tacky face, then it's worth a try. I'm not used to wearing much of anything on my face other than a light moisturizer, so it could just be that I'm not used to the feeling on my face.",1
Always a great smell! It's a classic that I hope never goes away!  the price was right and free shipping and quick response! What's not to like!,1
Ive used other Davines products and loved them... The consistency of this product specifically didn't work very well.  I felt like I was using double the amount of shampoo to get a good lather.,0
NICE,1
I'm happy with this purchase.,1
Several friends and hair stylists recommended this. I did not like it and returned it. It may be ok but it wasn't comfortable to hold and it smellled bad.,0
Works great for fine hair! Leaves hair very manageable and soft. I highly recommend this product to anyone ! !,1
Bogus product. This is not really Nectifirm and it does not work at all. I would recommend you not buy this product.,0
"The AHAVA Dead See Water Mineral Hand Cream does an excellent job at softening and moisturizing my hands. In fact, it's one of the best hand creams I've ever tried- and I've tried quite a few! I like that it absorbs quickly into my skin without leaving any greasy residue. Even better, the softness lasts for hours rather than fading shortly after the hand cream is applied. It actually leaves my hands feeling quite silky. My only complaint is the smell. I wish I could describe the smell of the lotion but it reminds me of something slightly flowery, like an elderly lady might use (and while I'm getting older, I'm not elderly yet LOL!). I think the benefits of the hand cream outweigh the smell, but it's definitely something I consider before reaching first for this hand cream.",1
"Best hairspray I've ever used.  Hair stays in place, but not stiff and crunchy.  Great scent as well.",1
I don't know if the formula has changed or if I just got an old batch.  But what used to be a wonderful product now applies poorly and flakes off all over my cheeks.  I'm very disappointed.,0
For a few more dollars I could've gotten a much BIGGER bottle!!!!!!!! Content amount is Not worth it!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a rip off to buy this item for that amount,0
"The knife I received did not look like the file which I received.  Mine did not have the hook on the end, as shown in the advertisement, and was all ceramic.  It works well, but I wanted the other one.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zwilling-J-A-Henckels-Pour-Homme-Ceramic-Folding-Pocket-File/dp/B001B6G2RM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zwilling J.A.

Recommended by a friend.  Helps soothe aches in a hot bath.  And makes skin super sort too.  Recommend it!  Buy!,1
You can never beat this curling iron!  My last one lasted 6 years and I have very thick and long hair with almost everyday use! All time FAV!,1
I am not impressed with this conditioner. It doesn't make your hair any softer or less tangled. I feel like I bought 98 cent conditioner for way too much!,0
"I don't think this is a particularly effective product. I tried using it on those deep under the skin pimples, and the ones at the surface, and it did not make any sort of difference. I find that tea tree oil is much more effective. However, this does go quite nicely under makeup.",0
"I have used this product for several years, and loved it.  The last two cans have had a strange, almost stale smell and have given a strange, stiff texture to my hair.  Not sure I will order again.",0
"My wife loves this blow dryer.  She is on her third one now... but this over a number of years.  They should probably last longer, but it does see a lot of use.  It only consumes 1500 watts (and does a good job), so good for the electrical circuit that is actively sharing other electrical loads. With this dryer we have never had to reset the house circuit breaker from overload (old house circuits are only 15 amp). She gives it 5 stars, I give it four for having to take it apart to bypass a failed GFI and a burnt switch issue on previous units.",1
"I was a little disappointed because it didn't smell like I thought it would smell; I thought it would smell more like a linen scent; the smell of clothing straight from a dryer, not like a strong bathroom cleaner. In addition to the scent, the fragrance doesn't last long either.  Considering the way it smells, it may be a good thing that the smell doesn't last long but for the price i paid for this fragrance, I expected it to last a lot longer. I definitely won't be purchasing this again. If anyone knows of a fragrance that has a true clean linen scent, please let me know. Thanks!",0
"I plan to return the product. It doesn't do a bit of good. Sorry , I even bothered with it.",0
"It works very well. Very light and doesn't feel greasy. You don't have to use a lot of it each time, little amount will be enough and therefore it will last a long time. So you get your money's worth. I would recommend it!",1
"I did not like this product at all.  Using the product as described, I would only have gotten 5-7 washings out of it.  I returned the product, and UPS picked it up at the building I live in.  Then, They recharged me for the product.",0
"This smells great.. I like it a lot.. IF you can afford it. Very expensive I think. if this is a gift, I would definilty purchase.",1
"I usually purchase this product from the salon but this time I ordered it online to save a little money.  The first time I went to use it I noticed it was a different color than usual and also had a strange smell to it.  Therefore, I threw it away and won't order online ever again...",0
nothing like the product ive purchased in past from salon. odor and does not do the job its supposed to,0
So obviously not the real thing. I pay 135 dollars so thought this was a steal. No smell whatsoever and I have been wearing some time. Do not waste your money.,0
"This is a great product, I highly recommend it, but DO NOT buy from sellers off of Amazon. I purchased one in September, turned out it was a counterfeit item with NO warranty by Clarisonic, who wouldn't let me register the product. I didn't read the 1 star ratings who warned of this, shame on me. Let my mistake save you some hassle.",0
"I used this product because I like their eye cream but it did nothing.  As a matter of fact, I have good skin and it made it worse.  I woke up with very crepey, red irritated skin.  Once I put makeup on to cover it up it looked like I got a bad sunburn and was peeling because of it.  Luckily I was able to return it.  Amazon is GREAT about that!!!",0
Love it!,1
"It smells perfect, the texture is thick so a little goes a long way, so tiny and adorable.. I love it, definitely gonna purchase this again!",1
"This has been the best shaving aid I have tried. I went to the expensive shave store in the mall and they have expensive items that they gave me samples of, oil, shave cream and lotion. I tried it and could not shave with it. Had to wash it off and use my Proraso Soap. Great Stuff",1
"Really love the smell of this, I use it as a root boosting spray and whenever it goes flat I just have to run my fingers through my hair and shake it up again to reestablish the volume :)",1
So I bought the little bottle first to see how I liked it. I didn't use much each time I used it. Only was able to use it twice with that little bottle before it was empty. $22 for doing my hair twice? No thanks. It wasn't that good for that price. I honestly didn't see a difference between that and no product.,0
Ive tried this remover before and it didn't last long so i ordered it again.  This one doesn't work at all! !,0
It gives me that glow I need and not a fake cosmetic look,1
"did not work for me, but maybe for someone else",0
"I had a small sample of a product with this same name on the label. The texture of what i had does not match the texture of the product inside this jar.  I don't know if I bought the wrong thing or this is not the original product.  So I can't say.  It's OK, it a moisturizer, it seems to work alright, it's just not the same texture of what I thought I would get.",0
"I received this on July 18, 2013 and it lasted until November 30.  That's not even six months!!  I'm very upset because it's too late to return it and the Babyliss Web site had zero information about a warranty.",0
This is not a pump bottle like I thought it looks like and was hoping for. You just shake out the powder. It made me feel like I wasmaking a powdered wig out of my hair. I will not beurchasing this product again.,0
"This creme smelled like a mixture of honey and old lady and not in a good way. The tiny spoon that helps you scoop the product out is just that -tiny. I don't like the kind of creams that you must dip in due to the risk of bacteria. I don't care how expensive this creme is or what celebrity utilizes it. I enjoyed faces creams from Benefit, Ponds, and others that smelled better. 4 weeks into applying this creme and I didn't see a difference.",0
I didn't like the spray. It leaves a heavy residue. Even worse after using once seller will not allow a return. I strongly recommend that unless you love this spray do not buy from this seller!,0
A friend of mine wears this and I could NOT stop sniffing her... has to buy it. And I love it!,1
"This ""medium brown"" is dark chocolate brown.  Does not match my hair at all and is nowhere near the color depicted on the bottle.  Very disappointing.",0
it contains the aluminum component that isn't safe for humans,0
"After one use I noticed how this serum made a difference in evening out my skin tone and leaving my face looking tighter, but not like the Joker's. I am usually very sensitive to scents and skin products and I noticed no irritation or extreme floral perfume. I have been using it twice a day for a few days.

Unfortunately, there were no directions in the package I received.

I also found the delivery system poorly designed and a bit messy.

Last but not least, it comes in a glass bottle which means you have to be extra careful handling it in a bathroom where wet surfaces can make things slippery.",1
I didn't like it.,0
"I used the pre-shave oil, the shave soap and got the worst shave of my life!  I got major razor burn and wish I would not have wasted my money on this junk.  Only thing that is decent is the brush, but you can buy a brush and soap kit at walmart for $8.",0
Does not smell too good,0
"I got this in an intense red from Sephora.  I loved the color, but it dries your lips out like crazy. If you put any kind of moisturizer over the top,  you'll bleed color all day.  And even if I didn't put a gloss over the top, the stain came off on plastic--like a water bottle. Also, you need a steady hand to put this on.  If you don't get it on exactly where you want it, it's really hard to clean off.  Great, intense color, but fussy, fussy stuff; I would not purchase again.
L'oreal Infallible and Revlon Colorstay have been better bets for me.",0
"Happy with this purchase, seemed expensive, but it is very good quality and should last a lifetime, if you don't loose it.",1
Received used item. Very disappointed.,0
"This tanning cream is certainly a gradual one but that is what I favor over sudden streaks and orange hands.  The smell is familiar to other tanners such as Jergens.  It is also white in color which usually tanners are ""tan"" in color so in a way that makes it a little more difficult to see where you have missed applying it but other than that it is a good product and does what it claims.",1
My hair fell right after curling then it was all frizzy.,0
I like this product!!,1
The original is far better at covering acne scars. I use the original as one layer and then apply my full coverage regular foundation for a flawless look. I will go back to purchasing the original.,0
Too expensive. I found the product doesn't last. I work Inthe medical field and I wash my hands often. It does have a nice glossy shine,0
"No shine. If I wanted matte, I'd have ordered matte.",0
"I heard this was an amzing product, but it's certainly not for everyone.  This made my hair gummy, greasy looking and flat as a pancake.",0
I LOVE THIS SPRAY. Makes my face feel clean and refreshed. However the way that it was packaged allowed the product to leak into the bag. Not happy about that.,0
"This sunscreen is gritty. I even tried shaking it up, but it was still gritty upon application. Either there's a defect in the formulation or this product is old.",0
Barely anything comes out when you roll it on. Doesn't smell like I remember after trying at a department store. Should have bought it there because apparently this item can't be returned.,0
It's the best anti-shine I have used.  It would be nice if it contained SPF 30 to 50.,1
"First, the diffuser wouldn't stay on the hair dryer that it is supposed to match. Then, the internal metal part that disperses the air keeps falling out of the diffuser, thus making it unusable for its intended purpose. Very disappointing.",0
Amaba este bloqueador hasta que vi que contiene Aluminio y eso es demasiado txico,0
Very beautiful color!,1
Stopped working all of the sudden. I need GHD to get in contact with me and ship me a new one. This is not acceptable for the price paid! Please contact me!,0
The scent is so beautiful people stop and ask what I am wearing. The price is right too. The only perfume I wear.,1
"I had a very high expectation for this shampoo, but unfortunately it didn't help me to get rid of dandruff.",0
The products had already expired! I would NEVER purchase this again!,0
"I bought my ceramic 1 1/2"" Hot Tools curling iron 13 months ago from a local beauty store, thinking I'd gotten a near-professional style tool and was very excited to try creating larger curls with the bigger barrel.  I was disappointed from the first day and really should have returned it.  But having used it, I didn't think the store would take it back.

CONS:

*Very heavy and difficult to maneuver.  I can't say enough about this.  As most working women (especially working moms) would agree, time is of the essence when you're getting ready in the morning.  With this being so top heavy, it makes maneuverability very difficult and as a result, you have to work slowly.  The need for you to slow down is complicated by 'con' #2...

*Does not glide easily over hair once the clamp is in place.  If you don't loosen the clamp as you slide your hair out (for barrel curls), it will pull and tug on individual hairs.

*THE HEAT IS WEAK.  There's no way this sucker gets up to 480 degrees.  My cheap conair curling iron gets hotter than this.  Heat is essential for thick, coarse hair.  I have very fine hair (but a lot of it), and I had to use tiny sections of hair in order to get the curl to stick.

*It lasted only until this week.  It's dead.  I would think a quality haircare tool should last longer than that, am I right?  I did not use it every day- and when I did, it was only for my bangs.  It was too cumbersome and cool to the touch to curl my entire head.

The only pro I can think of is the ceramic (coating?- not sure if it's truly solid ceramic, though since the sucker is dead  I could scrape it and check).  It did not appear to damage my hair- but as you may have surmised, I didn't use it thoroughly.",0
"Haven't tried it as a shower moisturizer yet, but used it several times on damp hair before styling.  Is a great styling aide whether you are leaving your curls natural or blowing them out straight.  Must Remember......a little goes a long way, too much product and you will not like the feel of your hair.",1
This started drying out my hair really bad after about a month.  I had to use a repair kit for a few weeks to get my hair back to normal and then switched back to my usual Aveda shampoo and conditioner.,0
"Even with the spray made to make the fibers stay in place, they do not.
The fibers do rub off on pillow at night and you wake with them all over your face. The fibers brush easily off the pillow case and brush easily out of your hair. So don't plan to brush your hair while out in public. Also the spray makes your hair as stiff as broom stray. Totally an awful experience.",0
Love the product.  Have used it for many years.  It holds the hairdo and leaves no residue.,1
"Haven't tried it yet.  Surprised at the ""terra cotta"" color from the outside of the bottle, I thought it would be more muted.  As soon as I use it, I will report more objectively.",1
"I like this oil very much especially for my hair.  I have very long thick hair with a bit of frizz in the summer or warmer months, this is very nice one of the best oils I've used on my hair really keeps it nurished and soft.
I am not a fan of the Moroccanoil that is so popular, too thick or does not soak in as nicely and hate the smell and I've tried many other hair oils.

As far as a body oil its nice and makes you smell good but I think Neutrogena sesame oil does the trick for a lot less.

I probably will not use this on my face because I have very sensitive skin and I finally have it looking really good keeping with
Avene and Embryolisse products which are very gentle.

So I would give this product five stars but since I am going to be using it only for my hair I give it four.",1
"I was so excited to get this product. I have very thick hair and it takes forever to dry. Well I was highly disappointed. It worked no better than my inexpensive Conair. I was expecting great things from reading the reviews and being that it was a BaByliss product. I no longer have the box so I guess I'm stuck with it, but it is NOT worth the money.",0
"I've been DE (""wet"") shaving for a few months now, trying all kinds of different soaps. I love my Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shave soap, so I thought I would give the Proraso Sandalwood a try. The soap itself lathers pretty well (Wooden bowl, badger hair brush) a little looser foam than what I usually get with TOBS, but serviceable. Good lubricating action on the skin, rinses easily, overall not a bad product. The scent is markedly different than my TOBS Sandalwood, a bit more... ..""Classic"" I guess, but not at all unpleasant. It doesn't leave a strong after-rinse smell, just enough to remind you for a couple hours.. :-)

I give it 4 stars, as its just not as rich, and thick as I'm used to with my ""premium"" soaps, but its an excellent price point, and a solid product.",1
Mild in the beginning but after a few uses the fragrance is more prevalent.  It's has good moisture and not sticky,1
Pretty sure this is a fake; the liquid in the bottle was purple (not clear like other bottles that I had used previously) and it smelled like paint thinner (not minty like others).  Amazon was great with refunding my money but I won't buy these products online ever again.,0
I couldn't believe I found this for such a good price. I was a little skeptical about buying cologne online but this made me a believer. My hubbie has had it for about 6 months now and it still smells great on him. It's not watered down at all and is a quality product at a reasonable price. I will be ordering more soon.,1
This product is light in your hair and really keeps the frizz down for naturally curly hair.,1
Not a fan of this product. I can usually go 5 days before washing but this product greasy hair on day 2. =(,0
"Just not real happy with the way it makes my hair feel, it's a bit heavy an doesn't give great volume to thicker hair. A bit too sticky for me. Just not the best hair product.",0
The fragrance is horrible I wouldn't have paid $10 for it.  No such thing close to creed Aventus.  If I could return I would full bottle.,0
Didn't find a sharpener to be able to use it once the tip is gone.,0
Does not work at all! Am I using it wrong.,0
Did the job! Also noticed not much makeup stays on the burshes after the first clean. I do recommend this to others!,1
This moisturizer is fabulous. Was a little concerned about the fragrance but once it is absorbed only a fresh scent remains behind and skin feels marvelous.,1
Takes off my eye makeup right away without any rubbing.  Also clean my face with it at night with a cotton ball.  Use Benzoil Peroxoid to clean my face in the morning so figure that I can get buy without washing my face with water at night and now I can take off my makeup with confidence using this product and cotton balls.  This product is one-fourth the cost of the eye-makeup removers and face makeup removers the cosmetic companies sells and it is twice as good.,1
"This worked great on my baby. It took a couple uses since cradle cap returns, but it helped clean him each time...especially when we used a fine tooth comb to gently ""rake"" the scalp at a gentle angle. I was left with so much left-over that I passed the almost full tub, on to a new mom.",1
Adds plenty of volume to my fine hair!,1
"Greasy and hard to wash off, and it has a very strong ""sunscreen smell"". I love Epicuren but this product was not for me.",0
Really nice. Goes on very smoothly and lasts awhile. Iredale products are always good.,1
"I ordered this after using another well know lash serum because it has such great reviews. Unfortunately, I did not experience anything great from using this product.  It gave me red itchy and puffy eyes the first week of use, but I continued using it expecting results.  The redness did go away after a week  so I continued use, however after almost two months my lashes have not grown at all and I have been using it religiously 2x a day.  I have thrown this out and have gone back to the lash serum I used before I have only been using it for a week and my lashes look amazing. I wish I could say the same for this product because I had such high hopes.",0
"This product makes my hair gritty and dull. I usually love Sexy Hair products, but this wasn't a winner for me!",0
"Does not work like u would think, made my hair look patchy.",0
"This product is flat out not worth the price. It leaves your hair sticky and feeling like you need to wash it. The reason I gave it two stars is because it does give your hair decent volume, but it's sticky volume. Like a very strong hold hairspray without the same hold. Also, it does go on clear. It is barely an ""alternative to dry shampoo"". It is a hairspray that kind of absorbs oil. You could use dry shampoo then this, if you were brave enough. I will never buy it again. I looked forward to it, but continue to search for a good dry shampoo.",0
"This product didn't work for me.  My hair already tends to get oily quick, and this product made it seem much worse.",0
"This blow dryer is incredible. I have thick curly hair and this works wonders in getting it tamed! My only issue is that the attachment that comes with it is extremely flimsy and slides off very easily. It's fallen off multiple times which can be a little annoying. Not a deal breaker, but not ideal.",1
"samples are far smaller in person than they appear in the pictures. Not worth $19.99, especially since the credit you get can only be used towards specific, full sized versions of the items in the box, and most of the full sized items are very pricey.  It was a fun experiment, but not one I will repeat.",0
I really love these eye gels and think that they do make a difference. I'm giving this particular product 4 stars instead of 5 as I prefer the individually packaged pairs.,1
"Waste of money it plumped lips fir like 5 minutes that was it
This wastr of money.these reviews are false .im so dissatisfied with amazon now .seems like every other product is junk. These reviews are fals i would say because this product like i said witked for like 5 minutes",0
"I have very sensitive skin and this product still works great for me. It does sting when first putting it on but after 2-3 days of using it, the pimple is gone or at least a lot smaller! This is my second time purchasing this and will keep doing so.",1
I don't recommend this item.  Abulta mucho el cabello.,0
Nice soft scent.  Received in 2 days,1
"I already bought this three times, I use it before and after I put makeup on. Love it!",1
"I purchased this with the matching Pre-Shave and After Shave lotion. Has a great scent, not sure why people complain. Makes shaving a great experience.",1
My dermatologist suggested this shampoo when I was diagnosed with Rosacea of the scalp.  My scalp gets very red and itchy.  After the first use my scalp was white and clear for the first time in months!  Two days later it's still white and itch-free.  I'm amazed and will be a repeat buyer for sure! :),1
Gave it four stars only because i gave it as a Christmas gift to my sister in law. She loves it.,1
Really like this but it's expensive,1
Keeps my crazy curly hair straight on super muggy Florida Days,1
"This Sleekr Flat iron is innovative but does not work well with my wife's hair. I got it for her as a birthday gift thinking paying more money would be the answer to her hair woes, NO. It took like 8 passes to get her hair straight and never got ""sleek"". She has Italian hair and it is very course & wavy. I do not recommend this flat iron. We bought a Bio Ionic & it is perfect.",0
The color is lovely and it works for evening but its a bit glittery for normal day wearing.,1
Just started using this and so far the results are great!,1
"Previoulsy, I used this product recommended by my dermatologist at an alarming office price.  I purchased it here for less than half the price. Immediately you can tell the difference once applied.  Great product.  Shipped fast.  I would recommend this product for all skin types as part of your facial regimen.",1
Do nothing for my hair,0
"Strange looking product, but works pretty good. You dip the Q-tip in the bottom pink part and apply it to the skin. I imagine that the pink part is calamine lotion, so it definitely calms the skin and makes it less red. I wouldn't say this does miracles, but it does a decent job of shrinking the blemish overnight. Warning: if you're putting this stuff on your face at night, your pillow case will be covered in pink smears the next morning.",1
...and does nothing. After two months just to say I tried. Nothing. Does not do what is eluded to for getting you to buy it. Burned again!,0
5 stars!,1
This is the BEST  so far......,1
"I have been using this product once a week for a little more than a month (it came with my November CurlBox subscription) and I like it. The mask is supposed to feel warm when you apply it to your hair, but I haven't experienced that. I did notice that it applies with what looks like a lather, almost like shampoo. I'm happy with the results, though. I use it to deep condition, placing a plastic cap on my head and sitting under the dryer for at least 20 minutes. My hair is always super soft and easy to detangle after I use this product. It has a light scent that's not too overpowering. I currently have some breakage that I'm hoping this product will help stop and repair, but I haven't noticed any results yet. Otherwise, I would recommend this product.",1
Looks very natural,1
Mine broke after 45 days.  Clarisonic  makes a wonderful product.  This model is not good.  Spend a little more for the nicer ones.,0
"This product is geared towards treatment of delicate eye and lip area.  I used Neovadiol based product from Vichy that was facial oil (day treatment) and found that this eye and lip cream complements the other beautifully).  I liked the packaging.  Tip of the tube has metal end and if used directly on the skin provides nice, cooling effect.  I also like the fact tat cream is used on lip and eye area.  Often times we hear that eyes thin skin is the first one to show sign of of aging, but we used lips all the time too, so treating that area of the face is just as important as the eyes.

main ingredients include: shea butter, stearic, citric and palmitic acid.  I love that product is paraben-free.  There are two other advanced ingredients in this product that I am not familiar with: ProXylane and Proteic Gf.  I will have to do some additional research on these ingredients separately.  Also, all Vichy products use special thermal water from France, which is what makes them unique.  Loreal company manufacture s these products and they are available in major drugstores like Walgreens and CVS.  their price is reasonable too.  This product comes in 0/.5 oz size so it will not take much space in your bathroom (or in your purse should you decide to carry it.

Last time I received Vichy product (talk skin refinisher) the box packaging had Russian descriptions on one side.  This time, I was amused that there was Greek writing on one side of the packaging and English on the other.  This cream is thick but it spreads quickly and easily on the skin.  It also has cooling, tightening and smoothing effect on the skin (especially eye area).  It does not have strong fragrance for anyone who is concerned about sensitive skin and allergies.",1
"Bought this because of the good reviews. Disappointed. It gives a matte finish which is what I wanted,  but it has an uneven dirty look after a few hours. Since it is matte finish,  it is not easy to apply. I need to rub it into my skin to apply evenly which takes additional 5 mins in the morning. Overall it is not sheer but with low coverage.  I much prefer Misha bb cream which costs half of this with better coverage and easy to apply.",0
Liked this until I found out it has a terrible rating on think dirty. Found a more natural option for the same cost. Would buy it again if they got rid of the perfume - don't want to spray all those chemicals directly on my face. Fragrance is the new second hand smoke!,0
"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1
I am just using it I think it is a good producto for our fotos,1
"For some reason, this doesn't fit the machine at all and couldn't get any out. I bought it for refill.",0
"The product works when it works, but replacement disks are inconsistently coated with the abrasive (that is, not all red disks are equally effective even in the same package). Also. the stems on some of the disks (again, within the same package) is too short to be usable, so the net cost of each replacement disk is double what you pay.  I purchased all my replacement disks directly from the PMD website, & my experience was similar with each purchase. All in all, this is a good product poorly executed; I would not buy again.",0
The smell is absolutely terrible,0
"I purchased this one at Target - not on Amazon (so I think it should be an authentic model), and feel the need to write a review to let folks know - NOT TO BUY THIS FLAT IRON.  After heating up (which is really not too quickly)--  it apparently cannot maintain the heat level as after a couple of passes through hair, the blinking light appears indicating that it is heating up to the level it is set to.  I wish I didn't buy it. I've had the best luck with CHI flat irons.",0
"This is the first and likely last D\E razor I'll have to buy.  Since I intend to use this for years to come, I opted to buy once and went with a higher end product.  A wise choice, after using the 43C, I am certain that my cartridge days are over.

This razor has a reassuring heft.  The heaviness allows me to let the razor's weight and the blade work in tandem for a very smooth shave - I simply guide it along my face without pressure.

During my research I came across the term ""aggressive"" being used to describe razors.  Thankfully the 43C does not fall into this category.  I've been able to get a close shave without sacrificing my skin during the process.  It cuts so smoothly that it had me thinking I was holding the razor at the wrong angle.  But upon rinsing the razor, the sink was full of removed hair.  In fact, it cuts so gently that when I apply my post-shave witch hazel there is minimal burn, nor have I experienced any post-shave facial irritation.

I withheld a star because the handle can be slippery if your hands are damp - this can be scary for a rookie.  While a towel drying one's hands does address this, I feel that a bit of texture is warranted for grip.

All in all, I'm very happy to have abandoned the cartridge cartel, and this has proven to be a fine tool with which to do so.  I use one razor a week, but now that I've taken to drying the razor after shaving, I may be able go two weeks before changing the blade.

Update: It wasn't beginner's luck: after weeks of use, still no nicks, shaving bumps or razor burn.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase.

Update #2: Can't believe it's been two years... this is still the razor that gets used when I want to go for an all out shave.  It looks and works like new - truly a quality piece of equipment.",1
Was different from the picture and it made my nails peal. Make sure you get what you ordered. I didn't.,0
It works alright but it is extremely drying if you have sensitive skin!! I had to stop using it because even one use would lead to a flaky face,0
"I LOVE the LONDON Butter line and have several colors. I ordered this one with the hopes that it would have a purple shade to it like in the picture but it goes a muted, silver, kind of sparkly, pale color. Not impressed with this color.",0
It is the wrong one,0
This is not what I was looking for. Contacted the seller for a refund and had no problem with the request. Although it states it will not leave your hair feeling heavy...it was quite the contrary. My hair felt sticky...dry...and I believe it dried my scalp. I love the Ouidad gel. Have been using it for years but this leave in conditioner is not for me.,0
nice,1
"Very Thick, no oily.  Pleasant light scent.  So far so good.",1
"I have used Toppik for years.  I think it is expensive, so I use it sparingly. It does hide the shine of your scalp, but it doesn't make your hair look thicker like the ads state.  However, it used to be the best item to help cover up that shine!  Now I use Couvre Alopecia Masking Lotion first and a little Toppik over that, and the two work great together.  I recommend the combination, or just the lotion if cost is an issue.",1
"In my intro to wet shaving, i am one of those who loves to research and learn as much as i can to make hopefully the best decision i can.  (of course along the way you learn things that help you make better decisions after your initial decisions, and realize some things you didn't know to factor in in your original decision).

If you read around the internet, you will hear a lot about these 1 razors (Merkur 34c/Safety Razor vs Edwin Jagger de89).  Many will claim one or the other is better for different reasons (with seemingly the Merkur being the ""old school"" choice and established choice while the EJ the ""flashier"" of the two and seemingly the ""newcomer"".

I originally chose the ej de89 b/c of how ""smooth"" and forgiving everybody said it was, while yet giving an exceptional smooth shave *(thus satisfying for both the beginner and pro).  It definitely delievered.  But unfortunately my iKon Bulldog handle for it (to add some weight and grip) one day broke the securing screw on my EJ DE89.  I was devastated.

However that gave me a chance to then try the Merkur 34c (albeit I ordered the classic safety razor (3-piece instead of 2-piece razor) so I could use my iKon Bulldog handle to basically ""frankenrazor"" it to be just like a 34c.  I had foudn some obscure personal review where a similar shaver like me (thick coarse hair, sensitive skin) claimed the Merkur provided a ""closer shave"" due to it being slightly more aggressive than the EJ.

So that is the backstory and setup for this review,  In a nutshell, if you are deciding between the Merkur 34c/33c or similar vs the EJ de89 series as a starter.. the Merkur is definitely sturdier, better grip, and a moderately more aggressive shave.  That has been IMMEDIATELY clear in my results after only a 2-3 shaves with the Merkur after a month with the EJ.

For me, however, the ""moderately aggressive' shave meant more irritation.. MUCH MORE and not nearly as close of a shave. (My girlfriend absolutely complies with me on how the extreme difference in closeness/smoothness to the tough post-shave).  This is also in testing the top top blades Ive come down to in myh testing as well - the Astras and the Feathers.

The clear hands-down winner for me is the EJ de89 series.  So much smoother, and forgiving, and the shave is much closer to boot - MUCH.  I believe it is because the EJ's head design somehow hits the sweet spot on how to hold razors (be it angles, flexing, something) that it just cuts a lot cleaner and with far less irritation.

With the EJ i was having a lot of difficulties narrowing down my blade of choice between Astra and Feathers (although Wilkinson and Personna also performed very well and provided very close shaves).  Now I know why.  For some reason it just makes many razors perform SUPERBLY that you could pick a few (mild or super sharp) blades and still get that great same smooth shave.

With the Merkur unfortunately, its been nothing but trouble and worse irritatin than i ever got with an EJ even in my first week.  Even with an industry recognized ""mild"" razor such as Astra.  And this is after over a month of technique development and practice!!

Anybody in wet shaving will tell you personal results will vary so the thing people should take away from this review is this (which you won't hear anywhere except in one review at a forum i ""stumbled upon"" that convinced me to try the Merkur to get a closer shave....

The Merkur 34c/safety razor is more aggressive than the EJ de89 series.
It does have the ability therefore to get a closer shave for you.... but it is definitely more noticeably harsher on your skin in the process even with a mild blade loaded.

If your skin is pretty tough and you want closeness, choose the Merkur between these two.
If your skin is sensitive or your #1 priority is comfort and avoiding skin irritation - get the EJ de89 series and know that even using Feather blades will feel comfortable in an EJ de89 razor.

Enjoy.",0
"Love this stuff! It does pull very warm toned though, so definitely a good bronzer, not a contour.",1
"I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks. I use it morning and evening. I did feel a cooling sensation after application, but as far as making dark circles disappear, it has not, so far. And I still have the same amount of wrinkles as when I started. Time will tell. I will continue to use it til its gone, but probablly will not buy again, unless I have significant change in my eye appearance. I am 56 years old, so maybe I am expecting too much.",0
Nice color for two days. And very thick and moisturizing to put on!! Then fades patchy. Also it never dries completely and you feel sticky ALL day. So bad with feeling sticky!!,0
"It is a beautiful dark black color, but it does wear out by end of day. I am a person who touches her eyes often.",1
I've used this for years off and on with the conditioner and YES it does optimize your chance to keep and enhance your hair. I noted though that if I use it two days in a row in my case I get a bit of a reaction. But not always. NO SHAMPOO will grow your hair off if you're as bald as an egg. But it will activate follicles that were dying and optimize your ability to keep your hair. I've ordered this now regularly for more than 10 years and do recommend it.,1
The bottle that I got seems half empty to me. There was no safety seal on it so its impossible to tell if it has been used before. Im really disappointed because I really do like this product so far.,0
Nice change of pace  The colors are all you need ..mix and match the lipsticks for another look . The SMALL lipstick is perfect  size for a small purse .,1
Love the product and the smell.,1
"I Like using this over my lip stain from Body Shop and it looks really nice. It gives my lips a hint of glaze while also being a little red because of the stain. It gives me that gorgeous, natural look!",1
I like almond but the mint is overpowering. I have a hard time using the product due to the minty odor on my hair.,0
"I doesn't really straighten my hair like I was hoping it would. I guess my hair is too thick, but I didn't like it at all. It always leaves my hands sticky after I've applied it to my hair.",0
"I ordered dark brown.  I was sent black.  I immediately emailed them, they apologized, told me to return and they would send correct color.  I sent it back the same day, have never heard from them or recieved product or refund.  All I want is what I ordered.",0
Best solution to not wanting to wash your hair every time you get sweaty.,1
i have color treated hair.. i tried to use this shampoo until i have finished the tube but it doesn't feel that you had cleaned your hair maybe because it lacks foam,0
This is a great product! It absorbs nicely and doesn't have a greasy feeling. It also doesn't have a fragrance so you don't smell like your at the beach. It has all the proper ingredients recommended by my dermatologist to protect against skin cancer.,1
Purchased March of 2016. It died today. I don't have a lot of hair so it wasn't used for long periods of time. Cant anyone make a hairdryer that lasts?,0
I don't know what happened but the heat just stopped. Now I'm contacting the store this came from through Amazon to try to get my money back. Not sure if I should try to replace it with another one. Liked the blow dryer but what a disappointment.,0
Beautiful color,1
"I was looking for a curling iron with a 220v plug.  Used those search keywords.  Curling iron came up and even said for 110-220v plugs.  However, you have to buy an adapter and I was purchasing it so that I wouldn't have to buy one.  The adapter plus the curling iron costs more than I would've paid for one here.  Disappointed.",0
"It is truly ""all natural"" hair balm, and works great on my frizzy, curly hair.",1
Did not hold my curls at all and it smells like really strong old woman perfume.,0
Love the device itself - has drastically improved the look and feel of my dry skin over the past two weeks of usage.  My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a stand of any kind for charging and/or drying device out - the lack of which is very annoying and could lead to outside of product getting scratched. As it is I have to leave device propped on its side to dry. Would be a 5 star review had a stand been included.,1
I don't see what the big deal is.  It's just a regular shampoo.,0
"It blends very easily and matches your skin color well, however, it did cause me to break out. May need to look into another type of foundation.",0
I didn't receive the right product,0
"i went to mont blanc store in Scottsdale, fashion square mall, Arizona
and they told me that its fake!
plus u can smell the alcohol that Mixtec with this
and the smell didn't last long at all, like the original.
not recommend to buy it",0
"The cream overall is of good consistency.  There's no strong smell, which is fine as well. Unfortunately my skin reacted poorly to something in their formula. The odd thing is I have never experienced an allergic reaction to other brands of moisturizer. And yes it was definitely this product. It was the only new thing introduced. I noticed bumps and breakouts in the areas I applied the cream on my face within a day. A few days in it still persisted. I stopped using the cream and it cleared up.  I'm not saying don't try it but do your research a bit just in case. Those with more sensitive skin should be a bit more wary.",0
May have been nice if it weren't so dried out. Seemed like a product that had been too long on the shelf.,0
"WORKS PERFECT! Tried everything with my daughters acne. THIS DID THE TRICK! Her skin looks AMAZING! CLEAR, not red, no little bumps! A+++++++++ (:",1

Way too long to wait.  (it was in stock)

"This mascara does an incredible job at separating and lengthening your eyelashes. I got the dark brown for a more natural look. Also, stayed put during a nap and that's always a good sign.",1
"crap with 3 months of use only this weekends, my short hair, even using only weekends broken !!",0
The razor looks nice and does provide a close shave BUT the amount of cuts on my neck and face is forcing me back to my Mach 3.,0

Love this product..will buy in the future.,1
"I worship this candle like a Pagan at Belltaine.

I love the whole Framesi product line. This conditioner really leaves my hair smooth and hydrated.,1
"Unfortunately, it doesn't do anything for my hair whatsoever.  My hair feels brittle when I spray on this product.  And it doesn't make my hair feel or look any thicker.  As a matter of fact, it seems to take OUT the natural bounce in my hair.",0
"Overrated, does not do a lot for my face. Disappointed",0
"Great eyeshadows!  I'm very impressed with the quality of these shadows. They are similar in texture and pigmentation to Lorac Pro eyeshadows which is about the best you can ask for. I already own the ""Nude Tude"" palette and love it so I was pretty confident when I ordered this that I would be happy with it and I SO am. They're great, buttery shadows with awesome pigment and very easy to apply and blend. The colors are a great range of nuetrals as well. Very pretty. ",1
"Bought as a replacement for one I broke. Have been using it for 10+ years. Very happy with it. Perhaps the HD versions are heavier and provide a slightly better shave, but for the increase in price I'm very happy with this. Like having the long handle.

Great razor.",1
"Used to be my favorite mascara. Or perhaps I need to go back into a retail outlet to purchase vs online. But its irritsting my eyes, doesnt tube, feels extremely dry and leaves flakes.",0
This curling iron did not get hot at all. I returned it right away. The Babyliss nano/titanium series one i got to replace it is great and virtually the same price.,0
I was really skeptical about this product. I've been using the rinse and toothpaste and accelerator for about 2 months now and saw results within the first week. I have some stubborn teeth that were still a little less white than the others and with the first treatment with the professional activating rods I actually saw a BIG DIFFERENCE. My teeth had already been actually pearly looking but I couldn't believe how much of a difference this made from the very first time I used this productt !  I highly recommend it and it's so easy to use and so quick! It takes literally 30 seconds longer than brushing your teeth. I love it!,1
E1 message and not heating up after 4 months.,0
Works great on sensitive skin - still using it on my toddler.,1

"This lotion is the final touch of my morning routine. I wish it was cheaper, but it honestly leaves me feeling smooth in the face. Using a little goes a long way.",1
my second alora ambiance diffuser. I don't like this one at all. rough and chemical,0
"I've used it for 2-3 weeks now so I believe i'll be able to give it a good review on my experience. I have oily/combination skin so I thought a matte lotion would be a great idea.

First time until the last time i've used it, the lotion doesn't seep into my skin. It sits on the surface and whenever I slightly rub my face, the lotion rolls off like exfoliated skin. I don't put on makeup, but I can only imagine how difficult it is to get make up to stay on.",0
Came with conditioner all over it.  Turns the pump leaks!  Works okay on my hair.,0
perfect!,1
see no difference from mascara half the price,0
Great face wash that doesn't irritate or dry out my sensitive skin.,1
Love the product but this very small bottle arrives a little over half way full. Not worth $24.00. They should fill the bottle for $24.00. Did I mention it's a small bottle only half full? $24.00!!!,0
"I received the 3/8"" curling iron on 3/8/17. It stopped heating on 4/22/17, and I don't use a curling iron everyday!!",0
"i wanted this for dark circles since I had purchased products before which caused little bumps to appear under my eyes- I've only used this for a few days but definitely love it, no bumps, light, great for sensitive eyes and skin",1
they are ok help a tiny bit,0
Very lightweight; I like the rubber thing on each side which keeps it from vibrating off the sink counter when I set it down.  Wish it had an additional fan setting--only HIGH and LOW.,1
I recieved this product as a gift for Christmas. I had one small zit on my chin that would not budge. Two days using this product and the zit started disappearing. Great product!,1
"I order two bottles at a time, I have ordered this for over a year now! I do not like the purple shampoo's my hair is silver not purple...love this product. I would recommend it for all us ""Natural"" girl's out there...it take's the yellow out!",1
This lipstick is exactly as I expected from the picture and description online.  I am very happy with my purchase.,1
"The first time a cracked the lid, I was a little worried when I saw the soap inside. Its a very soft soap, and will give and compress under pressure. Almost holding a middle ground between a hard bar soap, and a stiff paste. I was worried that because of this texture, it would not last very long. The bowl is a little flimsy feeling, but the lid fits on it very securely. The smell is wonderful, the eucalyptus & menthol make it smell like a more masculine Noxzema.
  It lathers quickly; and building a thick, dense, rich lather is very easy. The lather holds to your face very well, retaining its water nicely and not making a drippy mess. Because it does not take much pressure with the brush to build a nice lather, my worries of it not lasting very long have been dashed. A number of shaves in, and I have hardly put a dent in the amount of soap in the bowl.
  The eucalyptus and menthol become very apparent as the lather soaks in to your whiskers, providing a pleasant cooling tingle. It is not an intense feeling like some mentholated products, but the menthol it makes it's presence known.
  When the steel meets the skin, it cushions and lubricates the blade very nicely. Even with the normally unforgiving Feather blades, it provided a nice smooth shave with little irritation (even after re-lathering and making a second pass against the grain).
  It rinses cleanly and easily, and when paired with a good aftershave, leaves my skin feeling tight and toned. It doesn't seem to hang around, clogging up pores.
  Overall; If you have not tried Proraso, I would recommend giving it a shot. I have had many people recommend it to me in the past, but I just never got around to picking it up. I have been wet shaving for many years, and wish I had tried this product much sooner; It is fast becoming my favorite shave soap.

I shave with a Gillette 1-9 adjustable DE razor, and am currently using Feather blades.",1
"Not really impressed at all. The shampoo felt like it did more damage than good. The conditioner didn't really work or do much good in my opinion. The hard side of the brush is very hard and scratchy and uncomfortable to use. The soft side of the brush doesn't really to do much other than push the surface of my beard around. I'll stick with regular shampoo, jojoba oil and my Bass Beard brush.",0
Bought these for my girlfriend and she was disappointed; only 1/2 if the rollers would would work and they had to be tinkered with to get it to heat up... Poor design and workmanship. I would not recommend.,0
My friend uses this brand and her skin is flawless. I tried it and it Burned my skin. Created actual scabs. I know I have sensitive skin but I wasn't expecting that.,0
"Its very rich and creamy. I like to use it on my neck area  very moisturizing. Would not use it on my face as I'm pretty sure an ""acne party"" would ensue. Little bit of a bummer because I wanted something ultra-moisturizing for my face for winter. But no biggie and at least my neck is happy :-) Oh and my boyfriend who has very no-fuss clear skin year-round sometimes uses it when hes too dry  he likes it and he is not a product guy at all so thats saying something. So I think people with non-fussy faces that are dry would love this; maybe I'll work up the courage to try on my face heehee",1
"It is too small, but I love this make up. I switched from MAC and I did not have a issue transitioning. This products blends better with my skin and lasts all day.",1
Managed to grab this palette while it was on sale on Amazon a week ago. Not sure how and why but I did. The only palette you'll need in your life I'd say!,1
I cannot get this pencil to line my eyes.  The brush is so fine and the liquid does not dispense easily as you have to push down so hard that the line is not fine or continuous.  Disastrous!,0
"Bought this product for my son who had a shaving problem. Not anymore, great products will buy again or let's say he'll buy again.",1
Feels light and goes on easily!,1
Horrible clippers! Over priced and weak motor.. Buy Wahl Seniors.,0
"I've probably tried close to twenty different self-tanners through the years, and these towels may have been the worst ever. I'm white, when I use these I'm orange. You won't fool one person that this is a natural skin color. I'd rather go for Piz Buin or Dove which actually give close to natural colors instead of turning totally orange.",0
"Pretty positive this ""It's a Boy!"" color is an OPI knockoff. In my attached picture, you can see an example of a ""real"" OPI polish (green, purchased from Sally Beauty Supply, an official OPI seller) next to what I received from this vendor (blue). The font on the bottle is completely different as is the bottle itself and the brush. Held next to the computer screen, you can see that what I received does not even match the bottle shown on the web page. Very disappointed, and will never purchase from this vendor again.",0
So easy to use and lasts all day,1
It doesn't make my hair sticky though I tend to work outside most of the time. It adds volume and shine while keeping my hair healthy all throughout.,1
Of course I bought the wrong size & its too big to curl my hair so it's just sitting in my bathroom...,0
HATE THIS GLOSS THEY ARE TO HEAVY FOR ME.,0
This did not work well for me at all. Clogged my pores and caused major skin irritation and breakouts. It was very expensive and I would not use it again.,0
"I've been using this brand of sunscreen for my face since my dermatologist recommended it to me 3 years ago.  It lasts all day and provides superior sun protection, physical not chemical.  If I'm at the beach or outside all day I'll wear a hat though as well (can never be too safe with the sun!)  My only complaint is that I LOVED the Tinted Gel version of this sunscreen which is especially suited for acne/rosacea-prone skin.  That was my favorite.  Now they only offer the gel version in un-tinted (white) which leaves me a little white-pasty-looking, nothing terrible but obviously I prefer the tinted version especially for daily wear.  Now I have and use both the Tinted Creme and the untinted Gel versions of this sunscreen, but I really wish they brought the Tinted Gel one back!

Otherwise MD Solar Sciences should really look into offering a variety of tints because this sunscreen offers some coverage like a foundation and I think they'd make a killing offering a range of colors!  If they offered a color that was a bit more olive-based (my complexion) I would wear this daily!  Using an actual physical sunscreen as a foundation would be far more effective against sun damage than using most other SPF foundations which are chemical-based, don't offer as broad a range of protection and aren't as stable.  Alternately you wouldn't need to use a sunscreen under foundation streamlining 2 products into 1.

The color of this product is blendable and fairly neutral-based.  (I'm more olive/warm and it's a tad too cool for my complexion but very forgivable for what great a sunscreen it is.)  It's probably good for most medium-toned skin tones; not sure how it would fare for very light or deep skin tones, but maybe worth a try since it does blend.

Anyway, if you haven't tried MD Solar Sciences sunscreen I highly recommend it.  It is truly a special product.",1
All the positive reviews are true. No brainer. Enjoy.,1
"Bought this in November2016 for my daughter-in-law for Christmas 2016...she didn't start using it until January 2017 (and not everyday, only special times when she wanted curls)...quit working in November 2017 (11 months later). Tried to send it back to be repaired because I felt it would be cheaper than buying another one but Amazon does not give me the option to send back for repair (very disappointing). This item is way overpriced! She did like it a lot when it worked though.....I am planning to buy her another curling iron for her birthday but it won't be this one!!!!!!!!",0
do not like consistency.,0
"Definitely like this eyelash curler, since it's cool that you can walk into any store that carries Japonesque products and get the plastic/silicon refill thing. I compared the size with my long time eyelash curler, the l'oreal one, and it looks... almost exactly the same. The Japonesque eyelash curler feels a bit more sturdy and firm. On my lashes, the two feel the same, except that the Japonesque is a bit more ""bouncy"", but that might be because it's new. I use the two interchangeably, though the l'oreal one was half the price. I was only buying it since I didn't want to bother finding my silicone thing replacement. I was hoping to find a holy grail to transform my very straight and very boring lashes, but alas they remain stubborn. Rated four stars because I like it and for the lifetime refill hehe. Also it feels delicate on my lashes yet firm. But not firm enough to feel like the metal part will chop of my lashes.",1
Squeezing constantly and shaking the bottle still does not enable powder to come out in a satisfactory manner.,0
"Stopped working after 53 days. The power supply lights up, but the unit itself won't power on. I'm nowhere near the 5,000 flash limit on the bulb.",0
If I had never owned a chi and had been using a Remington or something than I probably would have loved this - it does seem to be of good quality but didn't come close to my chi - the chi dryer dries my hair much faster leaves it smoother and shinier,0
I like how it feels on my skin and I am not breaking out.,1
this arrived opened and spilled all over the box.. unsatisfied. will not buy again.,0
Quit working after one use.,0
I do not feel like this is the same product I ordered a year ago. Fragrance and product amount both are less for the money.,0
Love this mascara!,1
"I really like this cleanser. I saw results the first time I used it.  My skin felt very soft to the touch, and the texture seemed smoother. I suffer from hyperpigmentation, and using this cleanser has helped lighten the spots as well significantly reducing my breakouts. I use this at night with my Clarisonic and it helps to really exfoliate my skin. It may be a little strong for some, especially those who haven't used a product with AHA's, but it is particularly effective if you have problematic resistant skin like mine.  I only use it once per day because it can get a little too drying, and my skin is naturally very oily; so I do find that I must use a very good moisturizer with SPF to combat this issue.",1
I have been using eyelash curlers bought from pharmacies for 15 years.  My recent one broke after a while and I decided to get one with a good review on Amazon.  This one does not curl my lashes at all.  It is as if I haven't used an eyelash curler at all.  I tried using it before and after mascara application and it didn't make a difference.  My other ones always worked well.,0
"Ive been diligently taking these for over 2 months and aside from some acne got absolutely no change to my hair. Its expensive as well, I would just stick to plain ol' biotin.",0
The best face cream I've ever used. Actually got a sample and it lasted forever. Used it as a sunscreen but it was great on my skin. So I picked up a larger size here son Amazon and I love it. A dab 'll do ya! Literally this cream lasts a while. I use it under make up. Or just on it's own as a moisturizer.,1
"Terrible. For the price there are way better creams. This one is very thin, doing almost nothing to protect your face. You can feel the razor pulling on the hair while you shave.",0
"I'd buy this again just for the scent, smells exactly like vanilla frosting. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish it was more moisturizing on my dry hair.",1
"This is a great curling iron, does a great job at straightening and giving hair a nice wave, not great at making curls because the barrel is to big, but i like the body and wave it makes.",1
So so. Taylor of Old Bond Street works better for me.,0
"the Brush is so bad and hard it scratches, the shampoo didn't do anything and the conditioner makes it sticky and hard, that I have to wash it again",0
"I have been wearing Pink Sugar for YEARS, but bought a new bottle via Amazon back in November. I've been really itchy....all over my whole body since shortly there after.  I've seen a derm, tried food elimination, and taken heavy steroids and antihistamine med - all to no resolve.  I noticed tonight that my neck and chin got very itchy and irritated right after spraying this perfume near it.  The extreme itchiness seems to wax and wane, but this was pretty immediate.  I am wondering if this is a bad batch as so many of you are suggesting, or if there is a weird chemical in it that is bothering my skin?  Is anyone else having a skin reaction to this perfume?",0
It's not the real deal. Some weird sh-t from China. Could barely open the package.  Not returnable so I just use it in the guest bathroom as air freshener.,0
"I have had this 2 days!  I loved how it worked the 1st day, but it stopped spinning on my second day of use! It wasn't like it got tangled in my hair or anything.  It just stopeed spinning but the air still came out. Never had something break this quickly. All time record for me. Completely disappointed. Will never purchase from this company again.",0
"This iron heats up very quick and is easy to use. The black plastic tip area doesn't get hot allowing me to hold on to it while curling the top section of my hair. I believe the hot tools marcel iron doesn't have the plastic tip. I am not a professional hair stylist, just a regular girl so I find the tip to be helpful.

I have long hair (1-2 inch past shoulder blades) that is medium thickness and color treated. I bought the 1-1/2 inch iron and use it on 380 degrees to get big voluminous Victoria Secret waves. Hair spray is a must for me in order for curls to hold. But that's always the case with any iron. I pin up the curls sometimes for extra volume and hold.

I gave this iron 4 stars instead if 5 because it is easy to change the temperature by accident while curling your hair because of where the temperature dial is. The iron also does not have auto shut off feature. Overall this is a good iron for the price.",1
Not easy to put on. Doesn't glide on. But great color.,0
Love it,1
there are cheaper one out there,0
Good product!,1
I have been using BareMinerals for years but this relief powder really covers up my red adult acne spots and helps to cover the mistakes of my skin great. I do NOT know if it really reduces redness but it covers great for sure!!! I highly recommend trying it! The only reason I gave 4 stars because it can make the skin and under my eyes look dry if I don't use enough moisturizer.,1
The product is DRY ( must be old)  and really not worth the price I had to pay for it.,0
"This is not an authentic Oribe product. I've only used this conditioner for the past year and as soon as I opened the bottle the smell was definitely off (reminded me of cheap drugstore conditioner and not the signature Oribe scent). Then when I tried it, I was convinced and submitted for a refund. At almost $50, sadly disappointed.",0
Love this cream. Thank you,1
Not happy with this purchase from Beautogen. I did not get any receipt. Product looked like it could have easily been tampered with there was no seal. No phone number listed to even call.,0
Just love this stuff and it works. Good pricing on line and this can be bought at Ulta and Sephoria but I like the ideas of shopping online with no hassles of other people next to me.,1
It did what expected.,1
"ok I bought this product based ont he good reviews. I was new to this kind of shaving,I bought a expensive soap along with my Edwin Jagger that irritated my skin so much adn was very expensive. Out of desperation I ordered this and even tough the sensation was soothing and refreshing,it dried fast and the blade didn't glide. I developed redness afterwards. So my advice is don't buy this if you ahve redness,sensitive skinrazor burn bumps ingrown hairs. I used it as a face mask and it worked good,if you are as disapointed as I was and you are thinking of throwing it away that can be  an alternative use. Now I sahve with extravirgin coconut oil and Im thinkin of trying F&H or TOBS...",0
"This product is lame for the price paid.  I just got it this past Friday 5/19, today is 5/24... and the tip is already dry.  I had read this on other comments so I made sure to secure the lid each time I use it... but it still dried up! So not worth it.",0
The tube that this product comes in broke after only a few weeks.  the lipstick would not go down and now it's a mess.  I would save my money and not purchase this product.,0
This showed up and smelled horrible. It had to be bad. I simply just threw it out it smelled so horrible I've actually stopped ordering the poduct.,0
t product line would be t ,1
A good price!,1
"Product works okay, however the curls stay for very little time. The curler does take less time than other curlers yet the curls don't last for more than 10 minutes. Also, this curler does not work internationally so for special occasions out of the country this curler would not be ideal.",0
Did not like the smell.  It also did not work as well as other Paul Mitchell conditioners.,0
"If you are a professional this clipper is very weak .I bought one from beauty supply was enough for me to try it on  fine hair to realize how weak the motor is and has a disturbing vibration in your hand very tiring , very weak product . If you want a good one go for Wahl Senior.",0
great stuff,1
I received the nail polish and its just as I had imagined. It's a nice sparkly touch as a top coat!,1
Comfy comb to help tame the wild jungle growing on my face. Now the hairs seem organized. Doesn't pull or scratch.,1
"Watered down polish, I think they add something to the bottle and sell it as full and brand new",0
"what arrived is not  toenail clipper, just a fingernail clipper.  this purchase cost less than it would take in my time to return it so i'm now stuck with a nail clipper i don't need or want.  searched the web to find a toenail clipper and finally found this one, only to be disappointed.",0
Absolutely scent free.  Seems counterfeit.,0
works well is used correctly.  you need to be gentle...,1
I just started using this product on my decolletage to remedy sun damage.  It seems to be helping but I don't yet know how it will do over the long term.  I have sensitive skin & haven't had a reaction.  That's a good sign.,1
"If this is supposed to do nothing, I guess it is good at it. I notice no difference at all in my eyebrows' condition, growth, or otherwise. If you're looking for fuller brows, look elsewhere.",0
Damaged bottle. Product comes out every where but the nozzle.,0
"I know this is not a very large bottle, I ordered the small bottle to try it out, since I didn't want to spend a lot on the reg size or super size bottle if I didn't like it.
first off, the bottle was not all the way full! it's a small bottle, and to receive it not full, well that was very upsetting, it was about 3/4 the way full...
as far as the product goes, I can not tell any difference from the cheap brands (0ther than the nasty smell they have, so I tend to stay away from those unless in a pinch, however they do work...) and this, it works just as good as any other nail polish remover on the market...
so even though I love opi products, I cant really recommend this, I use it, and I do like the smell, it doesn't smell as bad as most removers do, that is the only plus I have found to this, because there is really nothing special or different about it to pay the amount for this product, when you can just order/buy any other nail polish remover and receive the same results, and not all of them smell bad, so it's not like that is enough to keep me spending this much money on a polish remover.
again, this is a very small bottle, and it did come not totally full, so you don't get a lot of product, I used it twice (for nails and toes each), and was out.
I won't be buying this again, I do wish I could give opi a better review though, but its just not worth it...
hope this helps...",0
"A Very nice scent to feel just washed and sexy. Not harsh and you will get addicted to it, guaranteed!",1
"The Curling Iron worked for about 2 weeks perfect, then one day I went to go use it and it singed off my hair within seconds!!!",0
Amazing product. My 20 month old daughters lips we're always dry even though I used Burt's bees. Justine application of this made her lips soft. I also apply this on her cheeks.,1
"It's alright.  I expected it to last all day but I have to reapply during the day, especially after I eat.",1
"It's pretty good stuff ,I just wish the bottle came with the pump top showed in picture. .",1
not really work for me,0
caused breakouts.,0
Nice glycerin soap.,1
"I have a full size BabyLiss iron like this and absolutely love it.  I wanted a smaller one for travel and this thing is definitely SMALL.  I can use it and it works fine, but its almost too small and takes longer to get the job done.  My hair is average - not too thick and long enough to put in a ponytail.  If you need something smaller for travel, this works pretty good, but all in all the bigger iron is faster.",1
Excelente,1
Right now I am not sure what to think as I have been using the serum for a week and each time it feels like needle and electric stuff for two minutes in my skin then now I am pealing anyone knows if it's normal?? I try to contact is clinical but didn't help much and told me to contact my seller,0
works good,1
"I got this as a gift for a friend overseas. She loves it and uses it all the time, but has to pay a premium price in her country. Even with the cost to mail it from me to her, it is a great bargain.",1
Great Product.. Great Shipping Thanks...,1
I love the lotion because of the fresh smell and feel...but the soap has neither the tingly feel or the fresh smell...it does have lovely lather though. AND the shipping was way too expensive for one bar of soap!,0
"I have been getting in grown hairs from waxing but my hair is painfully coarse in certain areas so not removing it is not an option. I got this thinking it was a long shot but the only alternative was professional laser which is even more expensive.

What I did was shave both sides of the area and just use the sensepil on one side at the second to highest power level. Two weeks later there was a lot less hair on one side than the other.

I will say that the hair I tried it on is probably a perfect candidate for the device. It is very dark and my skin is very light. If your hair is really dark and your skin is extremely light, this device might be worth trying.",1
"A friend recommended this product as my hair is very fine and thin, and I was complaining of not having much volume. It's not a magic potion, but it does work better than most of the root lifters I have tried over the years. The volume at my roots is visible and lasts longer than most other brands.",1
Bought it in May 2017 and just stopped working by January 2018,0
"This review is for the color Nude. I don't like it; I wanted Buff. I don't like the modified eyedropper either or the finish on my skin. Although the bottle is very pretty with a striking chrome top and stylish lettering, the system is clunky and wasteful. The chrome top screws off to reveal an eyedropper-like tube running through the middle of the bottle. The chrome top has a button that can be depressed to pick up or release drops of foundation from the eyedropper tube (much as a standard eyedropper's rubber bulb is pressed). If it were possible to keep the tube clean and only get the foundation inside the tube, the system might work. But the tube itself gets thickly coated with foundation that impedes efficient dropping at the eyedropper's end. The entire tube quickly gets glopped up with thickened foundation.

As the foundation came out of the dropper, I saw that the color (Nude) was an odd pinky gold that looked extremely artificial when dabbed on my light skin. The oddness of the color dissipated a lot as I spread it, but it never looked right on me. The Buff probably would have been better. But the texture was unworkable for me. It would not spread smoothly even though I prepared my skin with moisturizer and primer. I tried it a second time with moisturizer, no primer, and had even more of a problem. Finally, I tried it with a lot of moisturizer and that was the best. Still, my fine lines were emphasized by the foundation, which became dry and almost powdery as it set. My older skin looked even older by the time my makeup was finished. And it had almost a chalky look. I immediately washed it off and will not use it again.",0
"Can't say I loved it, no matter how much I wanted to. Should've been thinner in dimension and had a longer barrel. It did absolutely nothing for my hair, so it's going back. I'm giving two stars though, for a good concept.",0
I don't think it is worth the price. Did not work as well as it should have,0
"This aftershave used to be very thick and absorbed into the skin very well, now it is thin and doesn't absorb well into my skin.  After using this product for years, I am now looking for a new unscented after shave.",0
All I can say is it is really sticky.  No shine at all.,0
"Well I would have rated a 5. but I meant to buy my wife clean ""shower fresh"" for Christmas. even with the exception of me making the wrong purchase; the whole transaction was very fast and I would rate it a four only because a mistake I made... thanks",1
This is hands down the best leave in hair oil I have ever tried. I first came across it as a sample at sephora and have gone nuts about it ever since. I have thick crazy curly frizzy hair and this turns my curls really smooth without it looking as though they've been oiled. Not sure if it works as well for thin hair but def recommend it for curly hair.,1
"Lasted less than 3 months.
Horrible investment.",0
"I love matte palettes, and the price is good. The palette is smaller than you would think, but eyeshadow squares are of typical size.",1
"Quisiera saber como gestionar para que devuelvan el dinero. El producto se da y el cepillo dej de girar.

Dont get this crap came in spnish to smh,0
we love it!,1
"Pretty full coverage, I was impressed that I seldom needed to use concealer to cover trouble spots. I have very fair skin and the color matches very well and doesn't wash me out.  My favorite thing is that it lasts a long time. I used 1.5 pumps about 6 times a week since November 11th and I'm just running out now (March 9th). Also, you know when it is close to out because the product is pushed up by a flat cylinder like a push pop. It also helps you get the last drop.",1
Very easy to use. I use OPI glitter off peel base coat when I am doing gradient nail art.,1
"No way this is actual Paul Mitchell product. I bought this to relpace my last bottle. It is a different color, smell, consistency. Original is white, this is peachy color. The packaging was different. When I contacted the seller, I was given a rude ""we only sell genuine Paul Mitchell products"" email & no futher contact. DO NOT BUY FORM THIS SELLER!!",0
This powder is amazing! Covers so well!,1
My hair is stronger,1
"Sometimes the ""favorites"" don't work for me. I had high hopes but every time I used this it dried out my skin and it was tight. I have combination skin.",0
"I didn't like this gel at all for several reasons. First, I travel a lot and found the tube was weak and leaking at the base. As for shaving, it is difficult to apply. You have to use a lot of the gel on your face for your razor to shave your whiskers.  The tube doesn't last very long.",0
This product received so much hype that I cannot help but be disappointed - nothing more than your average non-foaming facewash.,0
Good deal .,1
My hair is very fine and wavy.  This is the first product that I have found that does not weigh my hair down.  Love it.,1
Good for night its a little greasy for daytime,1
"Its a nice product for the price, I might just make my own rosewater though.
It smells lovely, not too strong, leaves my face soft.",1
I was surprised to receive RED nailpolish. This picture is deceiving. I was expecting a pink color. It shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate.,0
I got this pills at Sephora u ddint read the reviews before I got them at amazon and I regret it because at Sephora it was goot revies they didn't have the bad ones I just bought the case for 1 month and I am in my third week and this week I just started breaking out a lot and oil skin and I am not usually like that and I notice this pills are doing that to me I haven't notice any hair growth what I have notice a lot is that when I shower I have a lot of hair loss and I drinked biotin before and that pills (Biotin) didn't do that to me so PLEASE READ REVIEWS FIRST BEFORE YOU WAIT MONEY!!!!!! AT SEPHORA I PAID $60 I thought buying stuff at Sephora was going to help but no be careful :(,0
I love the colors. I only wish the packaging for the product was better. Upon arrival the right side of all the shadows were shattered and blended into the other colors.,1
"not as good as other OPI products. not even for the first coat. can use anyway, but won't recommend to my friends.",0
Love it! Feels Amazing!!!,1
"I had purchased this same Strivectin product from another on line site and loved it! This product was completely different. Texture when applied felt dry. Scent was minty, other purchase was unscented.  Wound up throwing this out. Arrived quickly as promised. Price was good until I threw it out.",0
"Goes on well, really is waterproof, stays put all day without making eyes tired. Worth the price!",1
The product is great but it is highly overpriced. I've gotten twice as much for $25 less. YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS PRODUCT. Beware.,0
"expensive, but this is a great blow dryer.  extremely fast drying and quiet.  its heavy - but love the low emf.  i don't have one, but my hairdresser and another friend swear by the chi straightner.",1
"I LOVE this product! It REALLY works well for me! My skin is already looking and feeling better, clearer, smoother!!",1
This hair perfume smells amazing just like everyone says but after a maximum of 2 hours if stops smelling like anything. :( Will not be purchasing again.,0
This is better for my hair will be order another one love it.,1
"By Boots No 7 T Zone rescue for $10...same product, save your money. We've all heard the hype about the magic French wonders of Bioderma but you can find great lower cost alternivtives",0
"This product is exaClay what I was looking for. I have soft wavy hair not unmanageably so, other products sort of allow me to shape my hair the way I want but they leave my hair hard and stringy to the point where I can't mold it back in place if it gets messed up.

 This product feels natural in the hair (soft and matte as opposed to hard and shiny). I could mess my hair up just for fun and shape it right back into place with out applying more.  It's not annoyingly sticky, to get the clay off your hands all you need to do is rinse and wipe your hands dry. It washes off your hair with shampoo, if not like if you just wet your air not really wash it you'll still have some product in your hair, if you have fairly soft hair you can it'll still have hold, you might even be able to reshape your hair without adding any extra product if you like. It doesn't have a noticeable scent so it doesnt collide with you're natural pheremones and choice of cologne.

I first bought this online and put my faith in the reviews, now it's my turn to do the same for you.",1
"Wen Mousse is light, but gives my thick hair just the right amount of hold.
I would recommend it.",1
Bought this color to wear for a wedding I was in and actually love it a lot more than I thought I would! Very cute color.,1
"To be clear, I like the Glo minerals product. But the value is poor. I received this item and the amount of concealer powder is just one-third the size of my last purchase. It is 0.11oz versus .35.",0
"After decades of brushing my teeth with the usual American choices I bought a tube of Marvis Jasmine Mint on a whim while traveling. Using it is such a pleasant experience that I actually look forward to brushing my teeth not just to have a clean set of choppers but for the taste. It foams in your mouth more than Crest, Colgate, etc. and rinses out more easily. Expensive? Yes, but when one considers that you brush at least twice a day it seems a reasonable amount to have a truly exemplary product. I'd give it five stars except it is expensive....though, in my opinion, worth it. I look forward to trying the other flavors. BTW, my father's a dentist, my father-in-law's a dentist, my sister's a hygentist, two cousins are dentists.....Happy teeth run in the family!",1
Bought this and it does not smell like Obsession...it is not what I am used to.  Price was right but product was not.,0
"Love the product.  Initially received as a gift, now this is the only shaving product that I use.",1
"Right when I got these, my Clarisonic stopped working. Just died. Won't charge, will not work. I was excited about my new brush heads and they come lovely in a pretty pack...but I can't use them! I'm heartbroken. I will have to give them away or something. I've only had my Clarisonic sine Christmas, so I'm really peeved about it. I don't think I'll buy another Clarisonic because of this. I know this isn't about the brush heads, but I guess the Clarisonic brand in general. But, again, it's a pretty pack and will make a good gift if I knew someone with a Clarisonic spin brush.",1
this is an amazing formula. i love using it even when its not after a laser treatment.,1
Smells great and feels amazing,1
Not worth the money.,0
Came in broke can't use unless you uncsrew the cap,0
"Honestly, for me, vaseline works better and faster than this oil.  I am an avid cuticle biter and I wanted this to fix it.  In the long run and me not biting - it probably would help.  But in the short term and my ""quick fix"" to my OWN personal problem, I'm not patient enough.",0
Too heavy,0
"Nice texture and very long wearing. It absolutely stays put...even after showering. I have the Blu Raven and the Flamenco.
The Blu Raven is a deep blue/black that is very striking and bold. It goes on smooth and makes crisp lines.
The flamenco looks bronze in the jar but seems more frosted pink on my face. I have to layer it over a darker color to see it. Still has a decent texture for being a metallic (not as smooth as the Blu Raven).",1
"Too little serum in each capsule and too oily.  As others have indicated, the morning capsule resulted in a blemish which I haven't had in 30+ years.  Will not purchase again.",0
"First time I bought them they were amazing. Second time made me have horrible acne. Don't know if they changed the product, but I will never buy again. Try Peter Thomas Roth it's way better.",0
Its Removing all my stains from peridex rinse very slowly.  Teeth are whiter overall also. Decreased all my sensitivity issues too..its better than sensodyne!! I also.made a homemade mouthwash to decrease the acid and increase the Ph level also. . . My teeth are not dazzling white just whiter like when i was in my teens...i never had white teeth. Genetics play a role too.,1
I used this lotion after an aggressive laser treatment.  I waited until I finished peeling to start applying it and only did so during the day and my face has been recovering very well.  I will definitely buy another bottle so I can use it for any post treatments.,1
Spray bottle is a little messy. Product is good,1
Makes my head itch!!,0
I love the extended barrel.,1
holds well no sticky o stifness,1
I cannot rate this product at this time I will not know the results for awhile . . .,0
I don't have very sensitive skin and this lotion gave me a terrible rash. I used it before my cousin's wedding and thankfully my rash went away a few days before the wedding. Very disappointing because it really did make me have a natural tan... but when that is combined with a rash it is no longer worth being tan!,0
Love!! I had some pretty big breakouts and this helped out a lot!,1
I have dark hair and this product makes your hair white! Making it look gray not a fan,0
Love this curling iron!,1
"This didn't work well for me. Made my hair feel knotty, rough and unhealthy. Smelled nice but that as about it. I have thick, colored hair.",0
I was looking for a aluminum free deodorant and after trying many brands I've settled on MenScience product. It does the job and my armpits are happy.,1
"This balm looked like exactly what I was looking for: perfect soft sheer pink color, nice smell, pretty packaging. Unfortunately, there is something in the ingredients that causes a horrible reaction on my lips: they get numb and dry like I've been licking them in the wind all day. It also takes at least a week to heal! I know for a fact it's caused by this balm as I didn't use it for some time and then tried again and had exact same reaction. Am extremely disappointed, to say the least.",0
Love this stuff and it's a little hard to find.  I had a sample given to me at the salon and I'll be using this stuff from here on out.  I lasts forever.,1
"Not sure this works so well, I am still using it but can't tell if there is much difference. Do you sell a larger tube? Jonathanarland@yahoo.com",1
"This product serves well as a lip gloss, but it does nothing to boost lips.",0
Didnt work,0
"Doesn't apply eye liner evenly, smears and cannot do a smooth line. I have Walmart brushes that work better than this.",0
"I never thought I would enjoy testing out these beauty products, I am a wash and lotion with SPF only guy. This Hydrate facial moisturizer works well per my wife, she did find it a bit on the heavy side. For me, I put on just a little bit and it does make my skin feel smooth, the only issue I have is it has a bad smell, maybe its just the raw product smell with no artificial fragrance added, but I didn't like the smell. I did tough it out and my face did feel smoother. Other than the smell, my wife and I find this a good moisturizer.",1
I think that this is not nearly as good as some drug store brand mascara.,0
"I like what this shampoo does for my hair, but be aware that is VERY STRONGLY SCENTED.  The smell gave me headache and a sore throat and I had to throw the bottle away after one use. I wish they would make an unscented product.",0
"Good color, the product was clumpy and appeared old.  Won't buy again",0
Made in 2006... Don't even dare to open it.,0
"My daughter gave me this and I have gotten many, many compliments so I wanted some more. What a deal on line!!",1
"I absolutely love this hand cream! Not only is it super cute, but it smells really great and makes your skin super soft.",1
cant really say because I didn't get a chance to use it. product was left outside so ireturn it because it was watery and running & mind you i live in calif where its like 100 degress,0
"I had to replace old dryer and diffuser.  This fingers in this diffuser are recessed.  It took a little getting used to.  I don't have any problems. I read previous reviews about it staying on the dryer, as long as you push the dryer all the way into the diffuser it is fine.  I have naturally curly hair and it maintains the curl which means it works.  I just wish the fingers were not recessed and I then I would like it much better.  Overall it gets the job done and I am getting used to it.",1
Love this product.,1
Love this shampoo. I color my hair and Pureology Perfect 4 Platinum Shampoo makes my hair feel wonderful.,1
"Finally, some cleanser that can be used by adults. Most of the products for acne are made for very oily skin and are suitable only for teenagers. This cleanser is gentle enough for different skin types. I use it together with Effaclar toner and see the result.  My skin is definitely cleaner and there is no irritation.",1
"Makes my hands very soft, takes a bit to work its way in but totally worth it!!  Very trusted brand!",1
"Product DOES work.
Bad things is that it is WATERY.
You're applying more product to the shower floor than your own hair...",1
"This is not what I was expecting. I was expecting an oil finishing spray. This is a super sticky hair spray that will leave your hair hard and crusty. If you are looking for a hair spray that will hold your hair in place during a hurricane, this would be good.",0
Love this moisturizer,1
"Smells delicious, very light, fast absorption, ideal for combination skin or acne prone skin, so far the best oil free moisturizer I have ever used.",1
Just didn't feel this product worked as well as other generic brands.,0
"I am on my third one of these curling irons, and it's annoying that they so easily break... I like that it gets hot enough to curl my stubbornly straight hair without damaging it (unlike any other curling iron I've tried), but the spring easily breaks. Even though it comes with spare springs, shouldn't the company know that if you have to include spares then the springs need to be fixed and repaired for future models? Also, I lent my second one (bought here on Amazon) to a friend for half an hour and when she gave it back, it no longer heated past 100 degrees. I don't know if she dropped it or what, but to break a second one so easily after owning it for 3 months is startling and aggravating. When they wouldn't replace it through the Ulta store where I bought it or through the Hot Tools website, I decided to buy a third one simply because I absolutely had to have one for an event that night... but I wish I would have just spent the money the first time for the Chi curling iron and avoided this whole mess.",0
"Reallllly calms down skin irritations/redness. I used it even on my 2 year old daughter when she had a diaper rash and an arm rug burn. She stopped crying immediately. And of course, my acne prone face lives it too!
Make-up tip: after i finish applying everything on my face, due to the dewy hair on my face, the setting powder makes me look like i have a mask on. I spray a little of this magical water and it all natural looking afterwards. Doesn't ruin my make up if i don't touch the face until dry :)",1
"I thought I ordered the obsession for women for my girlfriend but I didn't, and it doesn't smell good at all.",0
"Don't like feel or smell. Is too thick.
Also slightly burns.",0
Hard to find item. Works well for my complexion.,1
"This was a knock off jack black, very upsetting. We sent it back.",0
"At an affordable price point, it provides wonderful latherability, lather itself, razor cushion, and face slickness.  It's especially suited for hotter days, where the lasting effect of the cooling menthol and eucalyptus are much appreciated.  Note: this cream really begs for use with a proper shave brush.

Four stars because (1) the scent, while not a deal-breaker, really isn't for me and it hasn't grown on me, and (2) many TOBS creams (with superior scents, at the very least) nip at Proraso's heels for just a few dollars more.  That said, Proraso still my #1 choice on hot days.",1
Not impressed at all. Truth be told there are several drugstore brands that do a much better job at a fraction of the cost.,0
"Sprayer clogs after first use, could not be cleaned or removed -- even with a pin.",0
"I'm a redhead who was beyond excited to see that this could work for me. Years ago I had professional laser hair removal years ago that didn't work and thankfully got my 4K back! Two years ago I bought an IPL home laser that also didn't work but at times I felt it was helping ingrown and rashes so I stuck with it. After the first few treatments I could definitely tell this would be different.

I spent a lot of time debating between this machine and the MeMyElos, same technology, $50 price difference. I was so sure this model said it came with more pulses and did the math and went with this model. I was extremely bewildered and annoyed when it arrived but was excited to try it and figured I had a braintarded moment. I thought I had read every single review and question but only after I received it did I notice that someone else specifically asked about the number of flashes. I'm still wondering why I was so sure it had more flashes and why I'm not the only one! Wish I had taken a screenshot when I placed the order.

So I would say it's definitely working a little bit but after seven treatments I'm still only at about 25% reduction in bikini area but less than that everywhere else. I'm using it on full legs, bikini, armpits, face and forearms. I haven't tried waxing before using it because waxing gives me crazy ingrowns and because I still have darker hairs that shouldn't be waxed! On my face I do tweeze coarser hairs.

I'm 5' tall (size 4-6 so super petite) and the bulb died after about 5-6 treatments. Maybe if you're only treating smaller areas the bulb will last but when you spend this much money on the laser of course you want to use it everywhere! I thought about returning it but I'm so desperate to stop the ingrown hairs so I ordered another bulb.

Hopefully I'll update this after more treatments with some better results. More importantly, I hope that the new bulb lasts long enough to find out.

PS... I think the estimated times shown to treat an area are based on having the laser at the lowest setting, where the flashes are quicker, and if you're only passing over 2x.",0
Best ever hairspray,1
Gift for family member,1
Worth every penny.  Absorbs quickly and has lasting healing effects.,0
Worked great.  For 19 months.  Then it only worked on low.  Then it only blew cold air.  Don't waste your money.,0
"Doesn't last, is sticky! Would def not not reccomend!",0
"Great cream with sweet odors. Moisturizes well, my baby
had any skin allergies. I recommend, Its a great cream, very good.",1
I love it and it is just what I wanted and ordered.  It works really well and does the job well..Thank You,1
"True and authentic cologne, just doesn't last as long as store bought, most likely an old stock.",0
"Love it! The shade works well with my coloring (fair skin, dark hair and eyes). I've used plumping lipsticks before with varying results. The butter London Lipstick gave me great results. Even my husband commented on it, which is unusual.

There is a slight tingling, not unpleasant, after applying. The color lasted for the better part of the day and I only needed to apply after my meal. It feels quite natural on my lips, I forgot I was wearing it. That's not always the case, sometimes a lipstick can feel sticky and you know it's there. Not this one. It goes on smoothly and looks great!",1
"I love this cream for my curly hair and was pleased to see I could buy it cheaper on Amazon than at my salon,  Now however Glow Distributor is the only one selling on Amazon and it is now MORE expensive.  I will go back to the salon to buy it",1
It smelled HEAVENLY  on another woman so I asked her what she was wearing and it was this.  I ordered it and it smells HORRIBLE on me!  It depends on each individuals oils and make up.  The only good thing was that I bought it with a gift card so I didn't lose anything.  The bottle is pretty.,0
"Does the job, but the cotton pads are sometimes stuck together.",1
"I purchased this product for a trip to scotland.  I paid $20 for it and it worked very well for that price.  Dont compare it to your expensive flat iron at home and you will be pleased.  I have short, chin-length hair, and could get my hair done in 10 ish minutes--managable but not perfect hair in that time.  It is dual volatage so you can use it abroad or in the states, i used my converter adaptor set w/ it anyway.  It heats up very quickly and is the perfect travel size---can fit in your carryon and not take up much space.  There are no heat adjustment settings--hot is what you get, so you may want to make sure you use a protective spray on your hair first.
Overall, very pleased w/ the product and the price.",1
"Excellent primer, terrible at what it claims to do. After 3 months of using this religiously, and after inspecting before and after pictures, I can conclusively say that this is a high-priced mascara primer -- nothing more. Go elsewhere for lash-lengtheners/thickeners.",0
Unfortunately the color did not match my skin tone...even though on the Dermablend website I looked at several different photos that all pointed to this color. It also didn't come close to covering my tattoo. Bummed. I really hoped this product would work.,0
It doesn't stay on very well and I would like a lighter color.,0
"I like nail polish, but rarely wear it because it always feels like my options are: 1) be excessively careful or 2) have chipped nail polish within a day or two. (To be fair, I've mostly used the cheap stuff.) This is my first time using Zoya and I'm impressed by how well it has held up. I made it a whole week before having any noticeable chips!

I recommend visiting Zoya's website because some colors look significantly different there. The color shown on zoya.com is much more accurate on my screen for the color I bought (Tulip). They also list an ""Intensity"" rating, which is a 1 to 5 scale of sheer to opaque. Tulip is a 4, and it took me three coats to get good coverage.",1
I thought it would be longer lasting than it is.  The color is nice for but Stila and the description-I have had better drugstore brands..,0
"At first I was hesitant to spend this much on a hair product, but it was recommended by a well-known blogger I follow and she hadn't steered me wrong in the past so I went for it. It really does work! Especially on those days when I don't wash my hair and I need to give it some life. It helps my hair feel fuller and voluminous without being weighed down or sticky. Very happy with it!",1
This is an excellent stain and color.  I can eat and not worry about not having lipstick on after.  This stain really stays put on the lips.,1
"Waste of money, dried my hair so badly and caused extreme amount of breakage.  Now have unusable expensive shampoo/conditioner!",0
Very good.,1
"This was very clearly a knock off. The end of the tube was not embossed with the Stila ""s"". The tubes were not the same size as what Sephora sells. I took it in to Sephora and they confirmed that it was not real. The coverage was not nearly as good as the real thing.. it was mediocre at best.",0
"This goes on smoothly and appearance is natural. I just wish it had better coverage. I Iove using all of the Dermablend products because they seem to be professional grade quality that gives you a flawless look..glowing skin, and overall perfection.",1
"Perhaps my expectations were set too high based on the reviews here or maybe I'm not used to using this type of product. Shaving with this felt and smelled no better than rubbing my face with a bar of soap. I've been shaving with a safety razor and brush for a few years, so I'm not a newbie. For this price range, I was expecting a premium experience. I didn't get it.",0
"This product is terrific for dry, frizzy hair.  Best price I found on the internet is at Amazon!",1
"I took one star off because it's not easy to apply. But if you get used to knowing how thick to apply it and for how long to keep it on before peeling off, it leaves your skin looking and feeling noticeably cleaner and clearer. It seems to make the face more relaxed looking.
You need to get the thickness in the application just right because different parts of your face absorb moisture more than others, it does not come off all at once. So it requires patience and finesse in the application- the way you time which parts of the face mask must be peeled away first.
Definitely these type of mask peels are the best treatment products to invest in, better than serums if you must choose only one extra beauty product. I recommend  use a peel off mask once a week with a good moisturizer rather than having just moisturizers and serums in your bathroom.",1
"I love the product as I use it regularly. However, when I opened the package, instead of one shampoo and one conditioner, I received two shampoos. And a considerable amount of the product had leaked out of the packing. I hope the supplier sees fit to make this right!",0
I have experienced some peeling but after the peeling it's over I love how my skin looks. My skin was also sensitive but it goes away after some time. I definitely will buy again.,1
"while did not cause irritation, it didn't stay on all day. had to reapply.",1
I am not sure how effective the product is because I had to discontinue the use due to it making my eyes tearful and irritated. Its a little pricey.,0
Love the color and the wear time,1
"I love this eyelash curler!  It really takes a while (maybe hours) to get used to it.  Just keep at it!  I have NO eyelashes, and my old metal curler just didn't make them stand out much.  This one gets up to the root close enough to really make them CURL and show up.  I use it before and after I put on mascara.  The reason I'm on this website is because I'm looking for another one. The first one I bought in different state while on vacation, and I want one for my gym bag and one for at home. I've had it for quite a while and just changed the pad (conveniently located in the handle) and it even stated on the package that we can get replacement pads free for life.  I don't know how to do that (or if they will end up charging S & H), but I'm getting ready to look into that, too.",1
I wanted to try something a little rougher than the sensitive one that came with my  Clarisonic gift set. I tried this on a whim and regretted it. It sort of hurt. I will stick to the normal/sensitive brush heads from now on.,0
"I bought this after purchasing Rapidlash, and it seems to work just as well.  The only drawback with this enhancer, is having to use it twice a day instead of once a day, as you do with Rapidlash.",1
After about 2 months the digital numbers that show the temperature stopped showing up but I knew it was on bc the screen would still light up. And about 2 months after that happened it just stopped turning on at all.  I usually love all things solano but I'm super disappointed. In this curling iron especially for how much it costs.  :/,0
Helps hold moisture in all day. No greasy effect just soft moist skin.  I will order it again I am sure,1
they are ok help a tiny bit,0
I use this all summer and never get burned!,1
"Never received shipment, put a complaint in, put in order on Dec. 12 it is now Dec. 25, no nail polish",0
"and don't buy this shade. Unlike some other reviewers, I like the natural, no-fuss look of clear polish. I have been using Romantique which is a nice, light pink-ish shade and it stays looking good forever, so I have to conclude that I know how to apply and ""cure"" it. The Clearly Pink though, begins peeling within a few days and before a week goes by I can't stand it and take it off. I have tried it twice, thinking the first time was a fluke or my nails weren't properly prepped. No such luck, it still peeled. I am just going to throw the bottle away - what a waste!",0
"There is something wrong with this product. I have used Awapui Moisture Mist on my hair for years and it always has a lovely fragrance. This smells dreadful, like old socks. It must be counterfeit or outdated.",0
Good,1
This is my second bottle of this color.  I love it so much!  I top it with a glitter coat & it looks so sparkly.,1
"this product texture is a little lighter than the bottle I have been using. People complain about the pump, I turn the bottle
upside side down and punch it and the pump works again",1
I have been using CND for a few years and usually like it but this color Does not stay on nails well at all...peels off very easily. Not a good purchase,0
really a hard hold the next day try and comb your hair it is sticky and I would not recommend it.  Again save yourself some money and buy a cheap one at the drug store.,0
"I put this on my face every morning and night after cleanser, toner, and essence. I'm not seeing any difference, honestly. However, just one drop on each shoulder has almost completely cured my bacne! Very pleased.",1
"I've used this product for some time and am very pleased with it as I have wavy/curly hair and do not style it. The product leaves my hair soft and shiny with minimal frizz! Also, VERY good value.",1
Great product! I order it regularly because it works better than any I have purchased in store,1
"Bought this for my girlfriend, who seems to think that this is the last word on flat irons. Warms up quickly, heat is consistent, and the slim design is attractive and handy. The heat doesn't extend beyond the plates so laying it on its side is safe, even though it comes with it's own safety mat. It's a little pricey in my opinion, but I was told that this is actually an okay price for a quality flat iron.",1
No good!,0
Very disappointed in this product. Does not clean face well. Cloths are too dry. I bought bioderma liquid and it was great! Hoped this would be as well. Not so.,0
"This is actually a good gradual tanning oil. It is a little thin bc it's oil, although that makes it easy to apply. Just used it once and did get a subtle tan and a nice subtle shimmer. Will definitely keep using.",1
Heating affect only lasts about two seconds. Not worth it in my opinion.,0
"Works as a nice light moisturizer. Otherwise, does nothing for the redness I chronically have on my cheeks. Also tried it on a sunburn and felt/saw no difference.",0
I bought it for my friends,1
"Came in fast and best price on the internet for the 5oz size. Wife and I bought this a year ago on our honeymoon and it is one of the best face scrubs/cleansers out there with the quality, smell, feel, and beads. Price is very good considering I have bought ""Organic"" face scrubs before and they want $20+ dollars and last half the time of this one.",1
"I really wanted this product to work for me, so I'm disappointed that it did not.  It made my hair look dry, dull, frizzy, and damaged.  I tried it on dry hair first and it didn't seem to do anything. Then I tried it on clean, damp hair after showering. I let my hair air dry and imagine my surprise when I looked in the mirror and I looked like a frazzled unkempt girl with my hair all sticking straight out.  Mind you, my hair in its natural state is unprocessed, Asian hair, straight with a very slight wave. My hair is very manageable and shiny.  This product made my hair look worse than doing nothing to it!  Well, there are a few pros: scent, pretty bottle design, ingredients.  Cons: did not work for me.",0
Disappointed w this eyeliner.. for $22 I thought I was getting top grade.  It flakes off & smudges. I even used eye primer to no avail.,0
I LOVE the Vinylux line of nail polish.  It lasts significantly longer than standard polish (up to 3 weeks sometimes!) but applies and removes just as easy as standard polish.  I'll never go back to basic nail polish.  Works great with the top coat too.,1
ok but too $$,1
Bought this because I  wear contacts but it starts flaking off within a few minutes of applying it and continues until I take it totally off. The flaking & clumps are so bad it looks and feels as though I have an eyelash in my eye. Was really hoping this would be the one product that worked & I'm very disappointed that it didn't.,0
Just hasn't worked for me at all,0
My hair is too thin for these huge rollers and clips.  My ancient old set with the wire clips stay in my hair but these don't hold at all.  Even the smaller rollers won't stay in no matter how tight I try to roll them.,0
"I have burned several Lafco candles, and this is the only one I do not like. The aroma can only be smelled when standing directly over the candle, and a strange gunk of fiber clusters around the wick. I have only burned about a quarter of the wax, but I am seriously considering cutting out the wax to use the container (and the container isn't even pretty).",0
"Ok, I have been wearing this for a while. This bottle smells like it's been watered down. Very unhappy. I wasted my money.",0
I was looking forward to the gorgeous scent of bergamot. Upon opening the box I was instead blasted with the gag-inducing odour of really bad perfume. Nothing about this smells like bergamot (or fresh -- or even old! -- tobacco).,0
Great pigmentation.  Live the packaging,1
I guess you need to use the entire bottle to before you see any changes. I won't buy it again,0
meh,0
"A natural looking foundation with natural and high quality ingredients. The price is high, but it's perfect for people who don't need so much coverage and for a nice everyday natural look.",1
Bad threw it away.,0
It run off,0
Hate it!.. Makes my skin terrible and make me breakout .. I would not recommend this product,0
Took to salon for gel application. All ten nails peeled off within  twenty four hours. Tried at home using my gel system with the same result. Tried without gel system. It was like soup. Trashed it...,0
"I love that this sunscreen is unscented. It works well and is rated well on EWG's guide to sunscreen for using the least toxic ingredients for a chemical suscreen. I'm just not sure why the price was so low ($13) the last time I ordered it in January and now it costs $32! Maybe the original rate was low because it was a promotional price so people would get hooked. Well, I guess I'm hooked but I liked the old price better.",1
"I previously had a drybar curling iron, which I loved except it started to leave a burning smell in my hair. With no temp control either (older version), I decided it was time for a new one. I read great reviews for the Beachwaver. I bought this size because it was recommended for fine hair. I watched many videos about the Beachwaver. I have it on the lowest setting, do not keep it in my hair for any time at all and I get curls, not waves. Great if you want curls, but I was looking for waves. Also, the little clip consistently leaves a ridge in my hair.
I wish I had not spent the money on this curling iron. After a couple of weeks using it, it now sits in the cabinet and I'm back to flat iron waves.",0
This is an amazing bronzer! It is super fine and looks so natural on the skin made with minerals. I apply the bronzer every day and it leaves my skin with a natural glow that lasts! I am in love!,1
"I tried this candle after seeing it on Oprahs favorites.  I am a huge eucalyptus scent fan and this is the perfect candle.  Not overdone or medicine-like and not too subtle.  Everyone who comes into my home loves it- even those whole never thought they liked eucalyptus.  Have one going in my office while I work and one in my bedroom at night while I relax.  Not cheap bu lasts long, burns cleanly, and is my favorite candle that I have ever had.  Glad I can buy direct from amazon and not from the company anymore.  Fast.  One click.  Done!",1
"I've been using this product for two days, and my eyes got really red. I would not recommend this product to anyone, it MIGHT work, but it causes too much irritation in your eyes.",0
Very dry tube. Not much mascara.,0
"I bought this lotion when I was about 6 months pregnant because I had tried the Tummy Rub Butter and really liked it. After using it for about a week, I developed an extremely itchy. scaly, and red rash on my chest, breasts, and upper tummy. I stopped using the lotion and the rash cleared up. I tried using it one other time later on in my pregnancy, and then again 6 weeks postpartum, but the rash came back each time. My skin is usually not sensitive and I can use most anything without any issues. I wanted to love this as I wanted something to help avoid sagging but sadly can't use it.",0
This product is fake! Do not buy! It is not the real Juice Beauty brand.,0
its great smells great,1
Was hoping it would work for my fine hair based on all the great reviews but it does not!  I still had fly-aways and my hair frizzes up after styling once exposed to the out doors (and I'm not in a high humidity area).  Didn't realize it was a spray liquid rather than a thicker lotion... doesn't given any weight or texture to my hair although it did make it silky soft,0
"I bought this and have used it five times now (once a week) and I have to say I do not think it does anything! it smells nice and doesn't sting my skin at all. I have moderately sensitive skin so I was worried. All and all I will not buy this again as I really question if it helps with anything at all. After reading reviews here and elsewhere I was expecting tightening of pores and sloughing of skin but NOTHING! Upon my next facial I will see what my esthetician recommends, as I have heard good things about the epicuren pumpkin peel!",0
Love this facial spray.  Helps with redness/dryness without feeling oily.  Just a light spritz works wonders!,1
This product is easy to use and has a great scent too. My daughter and I have tried it and like how it cleans our skin. It washes off without leaving a noticeable residue or oily shine.,1
Ahh this stuff is so refreshing on the skin. Helps soothe and moisturize without clogging pores or being overbearing.,1
"This cleanser is creamy and doesn't rinse off well with water alone.  It only comes off well when used in conjunction with the Gentle Lotion.  It is mild/gentle and has a light pleasant fragrance.  However, for the price there are other just as effective gentle cleansers out there specifically for rosacea at half the cost.  If you are thinking about using the Pevonia RS2 products for your rosacea you can skip the cleanser and gentle lotion.  Just use the Care Cream and the Concentrate, which are excellent products that have helped calm my rosacea.",1
"Meh . . . This stuff is OK, just not quite what I had hoped it would be.  It's reeaaalllly pink when you first put it on but thankfully fades pretty quickly to a more natural tone.  I'm not a fan of the way it works as ""cheek stain"" so I don't use it that way.  And it feels more like Chapstick on my lips than a lip ""stain.""  It's OK, but in retrospect I think it's way overpriced.  On another note, the ""stick"" has fallen out of the tube three times at this point, despite my best efforts to carefully pop it back in and gently press it down so that it will adhere to the bottom of the tube.",0
"I love this scent, I'm so happy to layer the body oil with the perfume.
The candle smells great, I just wish it was bigger so it would last longer.",1
I like this product - it's not highly scented (allergies) and seems to be good for my hair and scalp.,1
Loved it,1
They don't get very hot and curl doesn't hold well.,0
Just got it in today. Shaved with Astra blades and had an amazing shave! I had gone two days without because of the cheap blades I had before. Feels Great!,1
"This is the second time I purchased this product. The first time I purchased it at a professional salon. It quit working within 24 hours. I then purchased it from Amazon and this one quit working within 4 months. I had to call the manufacturer to get a replacement. They want me to pay the shipping to get the old one to them and send a check for $15 to get the replacement, which I feel is ridiculous since I've paid to have it shipped the first time, am paying to send it back, and paid @$75 for the product to begin with! If you want to spend over $100 to purchase a defective product and spend even more to have a back up dryer for when this one breaks, then spend away. My advice: RUN, DON't WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!",0
good cover but a little hard to control/direct spray if done as self application,1
Very small product. I didn't read the ounces before purchasing and receive a travel size powder.,0
"I asked around and read lots of reviews before buying a new straightener. The one I have was not getting hot enough any more and I wanted to take some time off my morning straightening session. Enter the Babyliss. The fat panels are nice but are not as long as my Revlon, so that is wonky but after using it I prefer short and fat to long and skinny. :-) The ""anti-frizz comb"" that some people are complaining about it removeable. I used it twice and popped it out of there; haven't looked back. It gets pretty hot, too, so beware. I turned it up after 30 degrees hotter than the recommended setting for my hair, and I have been delighted. My main complaint is that when I turn the light on, there is no indicator when it is ready, so you kind of have to test it like a clothes iron (you know, touch it really fast with your finger to see if it is scorching enough yet). Even my cheapy Revlon light blinks until it is ""ready,"" hence the four stars. I would def get it again.",1
"Pretty, stylish color. I like Essie polish, but it does chip a little bit. Very good price.",1
Packaging was horrible. It was nearly impossible to remove the product out of the box as it was tightly secured with zip ties. So tight that no room was left to be able to cut them off causing scratches on the iron.  Very disappointing...,0
Nice,1
I am going to buy this a lot. I save money this way.,1
I used to love love this product.  No smudging and easy to take off.  I recently bought 2 tubes and they are terrible.  The mascara does not go on smoothly clumps eyelashes together and makes my eyelashes look terrible.  What happened?  I would have given the mascara only one star but I just couldn't because I USED TO love it so much.,0
"I loved this product for the way it was able to smooth out my skin. I also liked it for the way it made my blackheads and pores minimize.
I didn't watch the video before using but did read the instructions. I decided I could take the discomfort and chose to go over an area more than 2 times and stopped a few places to try to get more stuff out of my pores. It did burn a bit, however, once the scabs are healed, it will all be worth it and I will try it again!
Thank you so much for making home microdermabrasion so easy!",1
I like this product.  Good for dry skin.,1
"I am in cosmetology school and needed a new blowdryer of quality. It came all scuffed up and banged up, it looked like it was used. It felt more of like a toy blowdryer. I would never blow out a clients hair with this, I would be embarrassed.",0
The service from order to delivery was good but the product seemed not authentic the fragrance wasn't as strong and dissipates fast,0
"I use the Elta suncare line and really find the products effective. I have extremely sensitive skin and normal suncare products break me out, but the Elta never does. Not so with this moisturizer. While this product says it is oil free, it has a very waxy consistency that sat on top of my skin and left me with a breakout after only a couple of days. Going back to my Algenist night cream. Expensive, but very non-comedegenic for truly sensitive skin.",0
"While this brush may indeed work wonders on your skin I ended up throwing it in the trash. It only holds a charge for a minimal amount of time and it takes more than 12 hours to recharge. It was just too frustrating to keep. Buyer beware. There are much cheaper versions that couldn't possibly be any worse as far as holding a charge and besides, this item is made in China.",0
I had an amika flat iron that was great but over time the plates broke. I replace my broken flat iron with this one. Shortly afterwards I realized the previous amika brand was better. My hair did not curl as well with this iron and then the electrical issues started. I eventual discarded this flat iron.,0
I have been using this product for 4 years and would not use anything else.,1
A great classic razor.  Well balanced and comfortable to hold.  You can't go wrong with this razor.,1
It's black powder.  You look like you've dumped powder on your head.,0
"I bought this product from the manufacturer's website in April. I purchased it because I was supposed to be an ideal candidate-- I have pale skin and dark hair. I followed the directions precisely for the first few weeks. According to the directions you are supposed to shave the area and start on a low setting and work your way up to the highest setting. I followed the timeline precisely as well. No results. I started using it on the highest setting once every other day to see if it would make a difference-- still nothing. I called the manufacturer to return the product and the woman recommended that when using the product on the face, use it every day. She extended my return policy for an additional month so that I could try it out. I still achieved no results. I recommend keeping all of the materials, including the product's box and shipping box and hanging onto it. If you purchase through the Silk'n website they give you 3 months to return it, and an additional month if you call. I got all of my money back.",0
My wife loves it took 20 min off her hair drying time,1
"The bottle came with a cap that doesn't fit. I originally purchased this body spray as a gift but I ended up not giving it because of the cap. When it arrived, the cap was taped up on the bottle. I thought maybe it was for protection but when I removed the tape, it was because the cap doesn't fit. I wish I was warned about this when I placed my order.",0
Ok,0
"I like the product for the coverage it provides.  I thought it would make it fuller but it didn't. It was merely a coverup at best.  There was no fullness or appearance of fullness at all.  Overall I could spend less and get the same results, however it didn't come off on my clothing and it stayed on until I shampooed it out. Having it stay on and not run was very good and I will buy it again.

Definitely adds texture to your hair.  I'm used to my hair feeling silky so I'm not certain how often I will use it.,1
"If you are looking to get raccoon eyes by the end of the day, this mascara is for you!  It just ""melts"" .....",0
"After reading review after review on Amazon I took the plunge and ordered the Babyliss.  I am an Amazon Prime member so I am always happy to find something that I want that will be at my door in 2 days -- this actually came in one.  (Though that isn't always good when I am trying to hide a purchase!) I couldn't wait to use this dryer so I washed and conditioned my hair the evening it arrived.

I will start off telling you the one reason I didn't give this 4 stars.  Others have mentioned the weight and I will agree that so far this is the heaviest dryer I have ever used.  I am getting better with it the more I use it and that is not enough of an issue that I still don't love it -- but I would imagine my Mom wouldn't like it since she has had carpel tunnel issues in the past.  I hit my head with this dryer the 1st time I used it because I wasn't used to the weight.  Though I am not known for my grace either.

I like to style my hair with only a hairdryer but since I had a mishap with some home hi-lighting, my hair is pretty damaged so it is too frizzy after blow drying because of its current condition that I have had to also use a big curling iron or flat iron to smooth it out.  No More.  I dry it all over which I swear now takes me about 3 minutes - this thing is strong - then I attached the nozzle to smooth and slightly curl my hair under.  Amazing.  My hair is smooth and shiny.  I honestly didn't believe that I would be able to style my hair so quickly and have it look so good.  The first time I used it I had so much volume that it was almost comical.  My hair was a bit too big.  I was used to styling my hair with a lesser dryer and I could tell after one use with this dryer.

A few mentioned the buttons.  I had no issues with them.  I always look at my dryer to see what the heat, speed etc is before using it so it didn't matter to me like others mentioned that you couldn't change your setting without looking.  It's something that doesn't slow me down or matter.  I used it only on high heat with both settings.  I use the lower speed with the nozzle for more precise styling and high heat, high speed for all over drying.  I have never been one to bother with the other settings.

The price for this hairdryer is great.  I've bought drug store hairdryers that cost $40 to $50 and there is no comparison.  I think it is even a little cheaper now than when I ordered it.  I'm tempted to order a backup.  That tells you how much I love this thing.

If weight isn't an issue - this is the dryer for you.",1
I love a great foaming cleanser and this product is perfect if you like a lather-filled cleansing. My skin tends to be oily so this works well for me.. I suspect it may be harsh for anyone with drier skin.,1
"One time used, had skin reaction be careful before even buying",0
"My wife uses this for daily removal of all the layers of makeup she spreads on ;)
Well ok - maybe not *that* bad, but she does use it for makeup removal. She loves how it works, and leaves a clean fresh feeling.",1
very pigmented eye shadow. I was amazed. The power comes off too easily on the brush but looked fine on skin.,1
I can't get it close enough to the base of the lashes to get the curl right.  I trashed it.,0
Came leaking all over inside packaging.,0
After the first few (3-5) uses the spray noticeably gets weaker and starts spitting.,0
"I really wanted to like this product, but I ended up throwing it away.  The lotion never fully absorbed into my skin and it left a white glow on my skin.  I am still searching for the perfect spf 30 daily moisturizer and this product just did not do the trick. I have fair skin and thought the ivory tint would be perfect, but perhaps I should have selected a darker tint. I will be trying a different product.",0
"The colors of the OPI Burlesque series are sensational...however, the polish goes on makikng the nails feel as if there were sand paper on top of them.  It chips at the slightest touch, but removing from nails altogether is a major hassle...acetone polish required, and nails have to soak for at least one minute, then only 1/2 comes off, involving another soaking before all polish could be removed.  I bought four of these in different colors...have thrown them all out and I love OPI polish more than most.",0
"I absolutely love this stuff, and a little goes a very long way. One spray doesn't seem like enough because it's so fine of a mist, but it really is. I would highly recommend this stuff, but it is expensive, so it might be a one time purchase for me.",1
"I have heard coworkers rave about this product. However, I am fair skinned and even the light version streaks on my skin.  I have exfoliated, etc. before applying the lotion, but as it develops I always have streaks. Very disappointed. For the price I expected this to at least give me a slight bit of color without streaks.",0
Perfumes are very subjective and it's hard to find one that fits. This has lovely floral notes and not too overpowering. The best thing is that it really lasts all day. Personally for me it's a little too 'sweet'. I gave it to my mom and she really liked it.,1
"There you go...picture says it all! No hair, hair! Just by shaking in some fibers on my big head.",1
"I received this product and put it away thinking I did not need to open it until I was ready to use it. I received this product fully enclosed in the box with wrapping so figured I was safe. Not so. The bristles were all stuck to the wand and it is totally dried out. Make sure you check your product if you order from this company. Personally, I will not order from here again.",0
"I wrote a review prior to this but do not see it posted which is good cause after further use I've discovered these are pretty crappy. One of the two I ordered the lid broke apart when I UN-screwed it the first time. I moved on and when I attempted to use the 2nd, the lid would not budge! After getting it off and barely even closing it, it became stuck again. It's like someone painted the inside with crazy glue. For $1 it's not too bad, but don't expect it to use it for anything long term.",0
good product,1
"I'm a huge fan of this product!  It gives the extra boost at your roots for volume, and you can also add texture to your hair and keep those sometimes pesky bangs in place.  Just always remember a little goes a long way and you can use too much.  Try a little at first to see what you really need so your hair doesn't get gunky.",1
My wife's eyelashes grew like crazy.  It works as described.,1
One of my favorite products!!! Great price! I will be back for more!!! Leaves my hair silky smooth and it's not too heavy or greasy!!!,1
"I really liked this comb but after owning it for 5 months, one of the teeth broke off.  For something this costly, that should not happen.",0
"I bought this product a year ago. I'm quite disappointed since I was expecting a tool that gets super hot while mine gets nearly warm. I bought it from Italy, I don't think there could be electrical mismatches since I correctly used the right plug. I tried to used it twice but any time I got mad. Just hate it. I hope I could come to US to prove if it really works and gets deadly hot down there.",0
"update 3/10/2017:  I have used about 90% of this product.  I cannot see any difference or improvement in circles, wrinkles or spots.

I like the formulation:  It is a light cream in a pump.  No smell at all that I notice (yay).  I wear it morning and night and it did not irritate or dry.  This would not be a moisturizer for most people, but is perfect for me, since I really don't need a moisturizer and have bought serums in the past.  I am at the age where I need a little more heft to my skin products and this seems like a perfect consistency.

I'm targeting my under eye circles/lines and a particular sunspot.  I will update over time if I see the great results I'm seeing from other reviewers.",1
"I wish I could give this negative ten stars. This is definitely a fake version of the real stuff. Im very upset over it, because I didn't find out until I was running low on this one, and just went ahead and bought a replacement at my dermatologists office. This is recommended on sensitive, post procedure skin. When compared to the real stuff, this is oily, runny, and has an odd tint. The real stuff is more creamy, solidified, and has a lighter tint. Its definitely not oily in the slightest. My skin has been red and irritated for months now because of this rip off product I bought here. I cant believe that amazon would verify it. I cant inagine what it would do to post procedure skin. Im so upset over it. Here I am spending my time and money to try and help my skin, and all the time Ive just been putting my money down the drain because Ive been putting who-knows-what oily, harsh-chemical-filled, pore clogging crap all over my face every day. Amazon needs to be more careful about what they verify. This isn't a joke, people could seriously end up with chemical burn post procedure if they leave it up to fate and up with a rip off elta md. I took pictures comparing the two same exact products, and as we all know, pictures show the difference, but it doesnt even begin to do it justice when you compare it in real life. Im not even sure how amazon could make it up to me. My skin has been red and stinging for 2 months, and its all because of this horrible product.

The one on the right is the real Elta MD. When you rub it in it has a creamy sunscreen texture and leaves the slightest hint of tint/white. The one on the left is the amazon rip off and it almost looks like Dijon mustard. Like its grainy and its significantly more runny and oily when compared to the real stuff. Its darker color/tint but its got horrible coverage. Its so upsetting. For someone who takes such good care of her skin, this is horrifying because I have no clue what I have really been putting on my face this entire time. I don't think I could ever buy a cosmetic product from here again. Ive lost my trust in amazon as far as these things go until amazon is more careful about what its verifying. For now, Ill always buy from real, physical, locations that are licensed to stock products and receive them directly from the company that manufacturers them.

Amazon, this should be just as upsetting for your company. So many people have grown to trust and be loyal to the company, but its situations like this that can ruin healthy customer relationships. Figure out where these fake Elta MDs came from and make sure it never happens again.",0
"It works good. I can't compare it to any similar product, since this is the first I've used anything like this, but I guess it deserves five (5) stars. In order to get the product to stay fixed in your hair for the most part, you really need to use a little hairspray. Even then, if you rub the affected area of your head against something, or scratch your head in the affected area, you're going to dislodge the product from your hair. But an application will basically last all day if your careful not to disturb your hair where it's been applied. Either buy some of the Toppik hairspray intended for this purpose, or personally I just use some regular hairspray.

I somehow managed to contract a fairly severe case of ""alopecia"" along the right side back of my head within the past six months, but there is still enough hair in the surrounding area to allow this product to effectively mask the problem. Hopefully the alopecia corrects itself. I'm experimenting with using collagen & gelatin supplements, including to be eating a lot of ""Jello"" to see if that corrects the alopecia. Just my idea, but since my fingernails and toenails are also not 100% healthy, I'm guessing it may be that a lack of collagen is also causing the alopecia.",1
"The soaps are pretty and smell great. I'm using them in nest center pieces for a baby shower. These meet that need.

They are a bit smaller than I anticipated - I was expecting the size of a Grade A egg. These are about 2/3 that size.

I ordered 3 boxes. Two boxes came with 5 soaps instead of 6. Amazon customer service gave me a credit for the missing soaps.",1
"I purchased this blow dryer when my CHI hairdryer blew out after a magical 6-year relationship. Based on the reviews, I thought this was a bargain find for a smoking awesome tool. The only thing smoking is my hair.

When I received the Babyliss in the mail, I was heading out on vacation and discarded the packaging since I needed to take it with me. This dryer does dry my hair fairly quickly (though not any faster than the CHI), but it leaves my hair tangled and parched with fried ends. My CHI made my hair silky, shiny and bouncy. I have naturally curly, very thick hair. It takes me about 30 minutes to dry my long, layered hair, but after I did so with the CHI and a round brush, it would hold the curls and stay super shiny and soft for days. The Babyliss, even when used with a round brush, straightens my hair, but with no curl on the ends. When I use a curling iron, my hair is so fried that it leaves kinks in my hair. I tried prepping with various products first (trust me, I use expensive stuff on my thick, curly hair to make it straight and shiny). Nothing prevented the frying.

Unfortunately, I cannot return it without the packaging, but I will be putting this in the cabinet and ordering another CHI. Totally worth the $150+ price tag for beautiful, shiny hair. My hairdresser is going to have to fix the damage this thing did...",0
"Totally love the smell, and the price! No complaints...",1
I have been using Dermablend for about 30 years but I believe they have changed their product and it doesn't seem to go on as smooth as it used to. I really wonder if they've changed the formula.,0
"I received a knock off bottle of It's in the Cloud. On the left is a real bottle that I've had for a while, on the right is the bottle I received from Amazon. OPI's label has never looked like that.  I'm so disappointed!",0

"Smells bad, burns, doesn't work.  Did I forget to mention something ...? Oh, yeah, it's expensive!",0
"I have the weakest nails ever. I can never let it grow out because it always breaks. This definitely do work. My nails was able to grow longer that it ever could using this nail strengthener/polish. It gave a very nice shiny gloss over it. Looks absolutely beautiful and fresh-looking.

However, I give it 4 starts because I'm not sure if my nails will only be this strong when I put this on. So if I take it off and stop using it, will my nails go back to being breakable and weak again? Not sure. Please tell me if you do have the answer. Thank you.",1
"I really liked this product.  I have very thin hair, but when I use this stuff it definitely looks thicker.  The only thing is that you have to keep applying it throughout the day and it doesn't make your hair very soft.  But overall I do really like this product and I would buy it again.",1
"I am not the type of person to usually waste my time writing reviews,but I was so disappointed by this curler (and so surprised, considering all of the great reviews it got!).  It is bulky, not comfortable to hold, and unless you have small eyes, I'm not sure how it can possibly grab all of your top lashes and curl them at once.  I had a very hard time getting all of my lashes in there (and my lashes are long, so it should be easy)...it crimped the outer edges of my lashes so they looked bent, and really didn't work very well for the center lashes either.  Total waste of money--go with the Shu Uemura curler--much better curler that actually WORKS! This is a piece of plastic junk.",0
"Very cheaply made, no powerful at all. I would use on someone with very fine hair and not too long Orr too much hair. A waste of my money .",0
this brush is great! the bristles are so soft and it really did help with my acne. i use it along with my favorite cleanser :),1
"very disappointed with the product , I used Kaboki earlier and that is far superior product . As this was cheap , I thought I would give a try ...
but very very disappointed ,Never will buy this nor recommend it to anyone .",0
"I bought this product less than a year ago and really liked the product. I felt that it did help massage and sculpt my face.  I was using it approximately 3 times a week.  I'm really bummed now though because the head piece broke in two.  I've tried every kind of glue possible but it will not hold.  Because I bought this trough Amazon, there is no one to contact to see if I can get the just head piece replaced.",1
"This product might work well for others, I just didn't notice anything besides a huge mess in the bathroom and shower. It's very pigmented so it was getting on everything! If you buy it I suggest making sure you have a towel around that you don't care about and be ready to scrub your shower.",0
Anyone that pays $36 for for this 4 oz product is being robbed.,0
Bought it for my wife. She seems to like it and uses it regularly. A side benefit is that it can be used as a night light as well.,1

"This is not a product to substitute hairspray or foam, this is more conditioner/ make your hair look and smell nicer type of product. My curls did not hold up even for an hour, fell apart right away. I like it is all pure and organic, but it does not serve the purpose. The best one I found was Giovanni strongest hold hair spitz - that one really works, and also organic/ natural.",0
Really wonderful product- especially for the price point. It gives great body to hair. I am very happy with this purchase.,1
"First of all I am a long time Strivectin user and I really love the product and the results.
I received a 4.5 oz size today but I am returning it, it did not have a silver seal under the cap as the authentic product does!
I must have either received a return or a knock off!  Buyer beware.",0
"Great shave soap, but not enough menthol.",1
It worked for only two charges. Extremely dissapointing!,0
"Really like this stuff. Has a good smell, foams well. Leaves skin feeling clean. Maybe a bit overpriced, like all BJ stuff. But I'll probably continue to use it",1
like the color but not the formula....streaks and very thick to apply. the top coat is worth it tho' which will work w/any nail enamel. plan to stay w/esse products.,0
This is my second PMD the fist one stopped working after about a year. I like the results so much I was willing to buy another.,1
I am new to the safety razor way of shaving but I love it and will never go back to the multi blades again.  The Proraso green is cool with a nice menthol smell that is not overwhelming or uncomfortable cool burn. I get a great lather using a quality badger hair brush.,1
Scent is too intense and hold is weak.,0
"It delivers a matte finish and absorves quickly.
Also offers more protection than others sunprotectors.
I had used another La Roche-Posay Anthelios, and this matte finish is much better.",1
"Product did not arrive with a seal on it, so I am unsure as to the validity of this being a Davines product. This product left my hair very dry. Not the desired outcome.",0
There is no seal nor any package to indicate this hasn't been opened. Don't want to use it on my baby.,0
Excellent creme.  First time purchased. Product as described. Even great for sensitive skin,1
"Japonesque makes some really high quality products, brushes and makeup, and they don't get nearly the attention they deserve. Their Kumadori line of brushes are really interesting, created as they are in the style of brushes used for Japanese kabuki makeup. I have the flat sided brush, and I don't know how I lived without it. It works fantastic for blush and highlighter, and even contour, and it's great for sweeping away excess setting powder.

Both that brush and this are made with natural hair bristles that are high quality. While the flat sided brush is a workhorse, this one is a bit more finicky. It really is lovely; the entire shaft is wrapped in what looks like bamboo, and it has a nice balance to it.

The brush head, though, splays out when you use it, making it a bit hard to work with for anything like contour. It does work well, though, for highlight, if you aren't using a heavy hand with your powder pickup. I usually keep my face highlight to my cheekbones, so this works great for me. If you were to use this on your nose or any other area that's got less space and is less 'forgiving' than the cheekbones, I don't know how well, or more importantly, how precise you could be.

It's a beautiful brush, and that makes you want to find more ways to use it. I'm pleased with it as a highlight brush, but you may be a lot pickier than I am (I'm have a light hand with highlighter; if you like to pile it on, you may find with this brush you bit off more than you can chew, unless you're going for Disco Queen!)

I'd recommend this, but as I said, the uses of this particular brush aren't as diverse as you might believe at first glance.",1
"I usually get a deep conditioning treatment at a salon now and then but it really doesn't do much. Then a stylist told me about Olaplex Hair Perfector #3. So I ordered it, combed it through my dry hair and left it in for about an hour while I worked around the house ( put a shower cap on as well,). OMG was I pleasantly surprised. My hair was unbelievably soft and shiny after I washed it!! Never has it looked so good. I just sent a bottle to my sister and daughter in law as gifts! You won't believe the difference this product makes on your hair!",1
wasn't thrilled with the scent or lathering abilities.,0
I have used Obsession perfume many times over my lifetime.  This perfume had a much darker amber color and I did not think the fragrance was the same.  It was just okay and maybe because I am 80 years old my sense of smell is not as good as it used to be!,0
Like smell that was about it... Very expensive...,0
"This product seemed to work great in my hair, until my stylist mentioned that my hair was inexplicably getting dark on the ends. I told her what I was using and she was like, that explains it...it has Red 40 in it (that's why it's amber-colored) and can actually dye your hair over time. She has even seen blondes get a pink tint from using it. She directed me to other brands that are pure and have no color. I won't be using it anymore on my blonde hair.",0
"I got this product at TJMAXX on sale for $20.00 from $29.99. I have been an at home waxer for over a year. I typically use a wax with strips (sugar wax, organic) and I LOVE IT. But there was way more wax then strips, so since I couldn't find extra strips I decided to try this kit out. I was confused at first because there was no strips in this kit.....but I soon figured out the wax acted as a strip as well - which was the biggest problem with this kit. I used this kit for down there.....when I tried to pull up on of the sides to remove, it was extremely painful removing those first few hairs. A few times I got the wax stuck and almost cried in pain. I handle typically waxes like a champ but I had some problems with this product. I can see it getting a little easier with more skill but still not for thick hair down there. The bikini area (sides only) worked pretty good and did not have much pain. However; that hair is thin and was not difficult to lift up the wax. I will go back to regular waxing with strips. I would use this product if I had arm hair or thick leg hair but I do not so I just shave - but at the retail price it is very expensive! I used almost the entire thing on my brazilian and could not finish due to pain!!",0
Did nothing,0
"I love Biolage products, they never let me down. 2 stars because the cap doesn't work. We have to pull the entire cap off with the straw and squeeze out the product. Annoying and messy.",0
Smudges:(  easy to apply but smudges very badly.  Photos taken after an hour out by the pool (I didn't even get wet)!!! I know it doesn't make sense but at the end of the day the residual is hard to get off even though half of it has smudges down my face. This week at work someone asked me why I was crying. I should have thrown it away then.,0
"First, the seller was great and sent me some samples to try! However, I expected more of this luxe balm product itself but I would say it is just okay. It is very sticky and heavy feeling on the lips.  I enjoy using the Vaseline lip balm more because it is very lightweight and you don't feel it on your lips. I would not recommend spending $20.00 on this.",0
"I wish I could give this junk ZERO STARS. For the price I paid, the only positive thing about this is the scent. It is supposed to be a cleansing conditioner made for fine hair yet after I used it my hair looked and felt like I hadn't washed it in weeks. I felt and looked gross.

I went to the Matrix website and saw that others had experienced what I did and the company stands behind their product and would give money back. I contacted them and haven't heard back so I am stuck with this. What a disappointment. I'll stick to the cheap stuff that I know works.",0
"I was using the Avon Anew retexturizing peel pads but they won't tell you how much glycolic acid is in them - even if you call them.  So I like using this because it says 20%.  I found another one that is 40% that I will try next, but you do need to work your way up - don't just start with the strong stuff.  They are thin pads, but they don't rip or anything - they work ok but they do roll up sometimes which is annoying.  I did like the thickness of the Anew Avon ones which didn't roll up.
I do the Visia complexion analysis and these made my texture score get way better.  Plus they probably are one of the reasons my wrinkle score is so good as well because I have been using glycolic acid for years - you should start when you are 21 and do it 3 times a week for ever - you can even go up under your eye area if you have tough skin, and I also use it on my neck.  I'm 34 and I look younger!  This is a product you need to use forever, not just one bottle",1
This moisturizer is very light and perfect for me.  I live in Palm Springs area and don't want a heavy moisurizer just one that hydrates my face.  it is a dry heat her and the hydration of this product works for me.,1
"I've never felt so ripped off in my life. You would think that by paying $15 for a luxury brand of nail polish, you wouldn't get an expired, old bottle of off-color polish that isn't worth a single cent. I ordered this polish in Trout Pout and have used $1 polishes with better quality than this. Please do not order anything from this brand online or on Amazon, and at least try a bottle out and buy at a store instead of taking a risk by buying online. I'll never order anything from this brand again. Hope others wisen up and do the same.",0
Holds hair well,1
"Toppik hair fiber is great, I am 25, started to thin when I was 18, I started using toppik when I was 23ish, yes you cannot jump in water, have people move their fingers in your hair, it can sometimes be a pain, but it gives me confidence so I use it.

Recently I was having the problem of covering up the frontal part of my head, and fibers near the hair line seemed like a darcula's hairline, and this when I started use optimizer, its not a 100 percent solution, I guess I might try the air pump thing for the front part, but if you are careful this is pretty good.",1
Prompt delivery. Item as described.,1
"Smooth coverage but it burns a little on sensitive skin. SPF 45 is probably what causes that. Bought it for my wife, and these are her words.",1
Works well,1
"The color Beso was very misrepresented on the website when I bought it.  Just threw away $24.00. It was at least three shades darker and so bright.
I would never wear the shade this one actually was.  Very disappointed in the product.",0
Super super light weight,1
"The color is nice. But the quality is poor. The nail polish won't  last a day on the nail , chips and cracks all the time.",0
I like how this feels when it goes on. It's goes on smooth and is truly non oily and does not leave a sticky feeling and it does protect from the sun. I would recommend it,1
Love the smell and the way this product makes my hair feel so soft.  ;-),1
This color doesn't look good in two coats. Have to apply three coats. And probably because of that it chipped in 5 days. Normally I am wearing CND products for 3-4 weeks.,0
"I would maybe be able to wear this on a normal basis if it wasn't so highly fragranced. It has given me a headache with its heavy scent.
I don't understand why this company feels the need to highly fragrance its products. And fragrances are an irritant to the skin as well. :(",0
Good stuff,1
Does not leave hair with a heavy look,1
Color goes on dull. Multiple coats makes it worse.,0
I did not like this product at all and ended up throwing it away. I do not recommend purchasing this product.,0
"This is CND's new product, one week duration.  Nice not worrying about if nails or dry or not and chipping polish.",1
"This is by far my favorite exfoliant. It's got the perfect amount of grit. The scent is intoxicating with a mild aroma of fresh cherries of sort. It only takes a small amount to accomplish the job at hand. The tube last a surprisingly long time. I use it once to twice a week, and have had my current tube approximately three months with another one to two months left in it. I would definitely recommend this product to all folks, and will be ordering more.",1
"I bought this for my niece's xmas gift. We received it on time, but the bottle was completely leaking. half of the perfume was gone.",0
too pricey,0
"The new product does not smell as good as the previous version.  Other than that it works well.  Best wishes,  Dave",1
"Really like the soap. Great smell. A lot for the price. Did not clear body acne as described, but still good.",1
"Dry touch?  When I first opened this the first thing that squirted out of the bottle was oil!  I shook it up and continued to use it on my face for about a week and every time I opened it oil squirted out before any cream came out.  Frustrating!  Anyway, I just use it on my shoulders and arms now, not for my face.  Would NOT recommend.  This received a lot of good reviews, so maybe I got a bad tube, regardless, I felt like I wasted my money.",0
"This stuff is wonderful for my fine wavy and sometimes curly hair.  I can put it on dry and it soaks in, boosts the curl and makes my hair so soft.",1
Great alone or over another shadow. I also use it  to highlight. A little bit goes a LONG way! Awesome product!,1
My husband loves the Art of Shaving collection.  This is a repeat purchase for us!,1
"Much lighter than expected. I did feel my lips tingle a bit, but did not notice any ""plumping"" of my lips.  The packaging was dented and dirty. Plus, there was a chunk missing from the top of the lipstick.",0
"I've had electro face treatments before and saw definitely improvement.  This device didn't deliver that.  I've used it faithfully for six weeks; before - after and interim photos reveal no improvement, no change, secondary viewers can't distinguish any timeline between the photos.",0
I didn't realize how hard our water was until I started noticing orange ends on my hair.  After a salon treatment and highlights I started using these product religiously and my hair has not turned orange!  I've also noticed less hair in the bottom of the drain and my hair is fuller.  I also love the fact that there are no harsh chemicals.  Delivery could have come a little faster but I just need to plan ahead as this product is not sold in stores around my home.,1
"This product was very disappointing. It's a very loose gel beware it gets everywhere. It's very dark but I was ok with that part, but I woke up in the morning and notice I had a hand bring on my leg where my husband had rested his during the night!  I jumped in the shower and the handprint was gone, why because after sleeping with this on all the night it completely rinsed of in the shower and without much scrubbing, just a gentle rub with a face cloth.  I figured I bought the stuff use it so I attempted it again over night and woke up this morning and I'm so blotchy.",0
Curling iron broke in less than 90 days. Ive had several of these and never a problem.,0
Great product for nails and cuticles. Strengthens cuticles and make hands appear younger!!!,1
"I like a lot of Nuxe products, including some of their oils, but this is not a favorite of mine.  I have been working out a lot this year and counting calories, and I have lost more than 30 pounds.  I've been trying different anti-cellulite products to get a little extra help, appearance-wise.  I've been using this one for a few weeks now.

It is hard to tell if this is working.  I know that 95% of reducing cellulite is diet and exercise, so I have seen some improvement simply because of those factors.  I don't necessarily think any of it is due to this product in particular.  (I am just using this on the outer thighs and rear end, twice per day.  It is probably going to last about six weeks at the rate I am going, which is a reasonable period of time for a product of this size)  I am not noticing much change at all.  (In fairness, with other products, I do occasionally feel like I see a difference.)

The other thing is, I really don't like the oil format.  It doesn't absorb well into the skin at all and leaves a sheen of oil over where I've applied it, as well as on my hands.  There are some other body oils I use on occasion that don't have this problem.  But I really don't like the greasy feeling I get after I apply this.  (I ordered straight from Nuxe so I know I have a legitimate bottle of product.  The pump works well and it is plastic, which is nice -- I don't care for body care products in glass bottles, which can break very easily in *my* bathroom.)  Also, you do have to massage this in for a long time -- that's in the instructions on the package.  So this may not be for impatient people!

It is not causing any irritation or sensitivity-type reactions, so that's good.  I don't notice a strong smell or really any scent at all.  (I have constantly clogged sinuses, though, so maybe I am not the best judge...)

Please note this has some tree nut and sesame-derived ingredients, so avoid if you have those allergies.  You can see the full ingredients list if you zoom in on the product images.

In the end, you will get the most results from diet and exercise.  For supplementary purposes, I find massage with a cellulite massager and coffee scrub in the shower on the affected areas, plus using a body cream containing retinol twice a day to be most effective.  I will not be buying this item again.",0
I want to love this so bad but it gave me a rash on my cheeks!! I have combination skin and my cheeks are generally normal. I get red bumps all over my cheeks from this. Its itchy and horrible!,0
"I couldn't tell that this product helped. It was like shaking a small amount of powder into my white hair. And its so tiny, which makes it expensive to use. Could not tell that it increased volume at all. And there were no instructions.",0
I have wavy and really frizzy hair.  I started to flat iron it which I wish I never had but it damage is done.  There is not much I have not tried but this by far has been the best!!!!  I still have to use a flat iron but I have been able to cut down on some of the frizz.  I hope it helps once the weather starts to get humid.,1
"This hairdryer has too much power.  There is no way to effectively control how much air pressure, making it impossible to style my hair -- all I get is hair blowing all over the place.  I returned it.",0
"The pump did not work, so we have to open the bottle to get the gel out, and then we have a big mess(( sad face))",0
"For a gloss, its pigmented and have beautiful colors. I recommended.",1
Not a huge fan of this smell,0
"After a traumatic first 2 weeks where it was explained by their product team that my skin was purging itself - all the bacteria/acne from below the skin's surface came up and I looked diseased. But after a week or so, my skin cleared up and it really did retexture my skin. It looks and feels smoother. WORTH IT! The only thing Id change is the strong smell of alcohol.",1
I did not see any change in my face,0
"If I could give it zero stars I would.  Absolute disaster.  Does not heat evenly, so while some of the wax is still rock solid some is scalding hot.  When trying to mix it in between the 30 second heating intervals I was burned severely.  It makes a mess too, and is very hard to clean.  If you do buy, be careful!",0
"I used to LOVE ALL of Vincent Logo lip stains, although I am not crazy for the new color of stains.  I bought the older stain colors and they don't go on as well and seem a bit old.  I hope VL decides to offer ALL of the lip stain colors and brings back My Sunshine, Cupid's Breath, etc. This color went on darker than the picture of the stain. I added a picture and it's much darker in person than with the lighting. Bit disappointed in VL color choices. Does anyone out there have a good stain that they like?",0
Still not sure if this is the original oil that I have bought at the salon.,0
"the jury is still out on this one. I love that it dries my hair faster but it is way too heavy, the warm setting is not that warm, and it is very powerful. Im giving it a few more tries to see if I can control it.",1
Highly disappointed with this scent.  I was not expecting a baby-power smell.  This smells very similar to CK One.,0
"Let me preface this by saying I'm in my late 20s. I won a bunch of em products from a bridal shower. The bride was a big Michelle Phan fan. I used to be too, but I guess I just outgrew her. With that said, I was pretty excited to win the basket with em products. Unfortunately few, if any, really loved up to my expectations.

I got this in ash blonde, which usually looks quite natural on me. I found that this one looked a bit off, though I used a small amount and used the spoolie blend it in. Disappointing, I think I'll stick to my Anastacia brow kit.",0
Awful clumpy thick zero length added.,0
"I switched from disposable to stop ingrown hairs, and this works. I'm using a shave cream instead of a foam or gel, and it's working so far so good.",1
"After 3 uses, the product was close to done. Not worth the price.",0
Meh. I have 4c hair that is on the dry side. This is not that moisturizing. I'm not very moved. My hair LOVES most of the Loma line I've tried though.,0
My husband likes it.,1
"This is a great product and my favorite shampoo. I've been buying this particular 33 ounce size from Amazon for many years as well. I've always been happy with my purchase until now. The shampoo that I just received has the wrong texture and consistency. It's so watered down that it's hard to get a dollop of shampoo from your hand to your head without having it run through your fingers. It's like water.  Rusk sells a reliable, reputable line of products. I can't imagine what happened here",0
"I bought this because of dry patches on my face. However the cream made me breakout horribly, and I wouldn't recommend it to be used on the face.

However, for anywhere else on the body this cream is a life saver. It sinks into the skin and makes you feel so soft immediately. The first thing you'll notice is the smell. It's the camphor, and it goes away quick. (If you don't know what camphor is, it smells like Vicks Vapo Rub)

Overall this is a wonderful thick moisturizer.",1
I love this stuff.  The smell is a nice jasmine smell (not the old lady stinky stale jasmine smell).  This keeps my hair nice and soft and shiny.  Liquid gold and my wavy thin hair loves it.,1
Excellent Serum,1
Doesn't last very long.,0
I like it.,1
Excelent Product,1
"Wow! The color is very pretty. I got the pink nectar creme and it gives this youthful pouty pink look. Its designed very nice and the item itself looks cute. Looking at the stIck part, the exterior is color and has a neutral balm center. That way when you apply, you apply both the color and balm. It could be more moisturizingI wouldnt say it would replace your lip balm. But its a good one to have around when you want some color or if you just want to do quick lip balm. Overall impressed",1
Not at all as expected,0
It stopped working after week that I used it when it was not able to return it in time to get a refund,0
"About a month after I got this blow dryer it started making weird sounds when I used it. Now, only 6 months after I bought it, it makes sounds and smells bad when I use it. What a waste of $70!!",0
This product did not really do much expect it did give me break outs.. I would never buy this cream again. Not worth it,0
"I wanted a DHT-blocking shampoo and knowing Bosley's reputation, I thought I'd try this out.  I've been using Rogaine 5% foam treatment for ten years, and while it has helped me to retain a good bit of my hair, still felt I could be doing more to protect my hairline.

The first time I used this, I found it tingled on my scalp, leaving an almost minty sensation.  This has persisted as I've used it.  However, I found that it left my hair fairly dry and brittle.  Worse, I've found that it significantly dried out my scalp, to the point where it's actually started itching and flaking out in big pieces.  I've added a conditioner, but the dryness persists.  That said, my hair definitely appears fuller.

If you're not prone to dry scalp, this may work out better - but I'm a little concerned as to what this has done to my scalp so far.  I can't recommend it.",0
It's great,1
"nice application, no clumping and does help your lashes to grow!!",1
Not worth it. My foam tanning lotion went through the mitten. Only one side of the mitten is some what thick while the other is super thin which makes no sense because it then becomes as if you are simply applying the self tanner with your bare hand,0
Could be more moisturizing but I have the driest skin on the planet so I cant really complain. This gave me a dewy look for about 3 hours. Id recommend bringing it in your purse for touch ups. Beautiful rose scent and not too many questionable ingredients. Large bottle should last a while,1
"If you lather up with a badger brush you have no excuse not to buy some of this stuff.  It's cheap, it lathers like a house on fire, and it's extremely refreshing without being overly mentholated.  You may enjoy it more in the warmer months than in the winter, but you should definitely pick it up and give it a try.",1
"*UPDATE* I've been using and loving this curling iron for a little over a month now and today it just stopped working. I didn't drop it, it didn't get banged around, nothing weird happened to it except for me using it a few times a week. I'm dropping my rating down to one star.

I don't mind paying more for a tool that does something amazing for me. In this case, this iron gives me soft, shiny curls that last all day. BUT, so does my Revlon wand at a significantly lower price. The thing that sets this curling wand apart--and above--for me is the time. I don't know if it's because of the way this wand retains heat throughout the barrel or what but I can curl my entire head in about 1/3 the time it normally takes me. That's huge in my opinion.",0
2nd time ordering.  It does smooth out my hair.  if you use too much your hair can get greasy so use very little,1
"Love this Calista Tool ionic hair styler.  Great product.  Kind on fine hair, and makes beautiful  soft curls.  Excellent Customer Service!!!",1
"I want to love this for my wavy hair, however it appears to make my hair frizzy.  My hair stylist told me to change the order in which I put it on.  So I tried that, it helps but don't love the way it makes my hair feel.",0
"A friend and I saw this polish on Pinterest but couldn't find it anywhere.  We were so happy to see it on Amazon.  It is an awesome neutral color for any time during the year, as well as any occasion.  You can top with a touch of sparkle for a fancier event!",1
Did not ever work! SAME ON YOU,0
Nioxin is a reliable company.. I have been using Nioxin products for years and im very happy.  This product was recd very promptly and was reasonably priced.,1
Not my cup of tea!,0
This product is an excellent cleanser and toner. I would purchase it again.,1
satisfactory and enjoyable use,1
Product came without seal :(,0
"Decent price for a 4 oz. tin.
Good hold throughout the day. A bit difficult to wash out of the hair",1
Me enviaron un perfume diferente,0
"I really don't think this is doing much for me.  It's kind of a fun product to use because of the colors (green, with black kiwi seeds) and texture (very light and almost whipped) but I'm just not seeing the results I expect.

Part of the problem is that the exfoliating particles (the seeds, presumably) are not very dense in this product.  You can feel them going over your skin and if there were more of them, I think my opinion of this product would be different.  But as it is now, a large percentage of your skin is never going to come into contact with one of the seeds as you use this, so most of your skin will not be exfoliated.  Since this is marketed as a scrub, that's a problem.

This is gentle and non-irritating when used a few times a week.  If you have sensitive skin and have had trouble with microdermabrasion-type scrubs, this could still work for you.  Please note that it has alpha hydroxy acids and so should be used in combination with a sunscreen.  It does rinse off cleanly and without leaving residue, as well.

For what it's worth, I'm having more breakouts with this than before I used it.  I don't necessarily think it is causing the breakouts, but the less-effective exfoliation (as opposed to my previous scrub product) is slowing turnover of my skin cells, which is what's causing my problems.

In the end, this may be worth a try if you have really sensitive skin.  Otherwise, I'd look for a different product.  (Please note: you can read the full ingredients list in the product images.)",0
Yes,1
"This lotion smells good and seems to be moisturizing, but it doesn't last the whole day. My legs get really dry, and after 8 hours they're ashy again. I like the smell, but I wouldn't call it body butter.",1
It has been a great product! Thank you!! My Nails are very soft and this has helped quite a lot!,1
This isn't magic but it does seem to reduce the time it takes my pimples to go away.  Particularly effective on cystic acne if you catch them right away can sometimes even prevent from full forming.,1
"This is the one that I'm using it the most,but one time I did drop it on my tiles and it shattered way to easy in half,but  used some glue , still using it.",1
I purchased this product because I saw it featured in a magazine and decided to give it a shot (even though I thought the price was kind of high).  I like that it defines my brows and molds them into shape for the rest of the day.  I typically apply this product first and then apply a light brow powder over it to really make my brows stand out. I'm a light blonde so my brows are almost non-existent without some color.  You don't get much in the tube and it's a little pricey...but I will definitely reorder.,1
"This feels very dry going on, almost like a powder. I prefer more moisture.",0
"I've heard alot of good things about this brand, and I just had just started a new prescription for my acne that makes my skin extremely dry so I wanted to find a specific cleanser that would moisturize my face. This product is just OK to me, I most likely would not buy it again. My first problem is the consistency. It is not foamy and it doesn't lather like a cleanser should in my opinion, it literally just feels like oily lotion. The directions say to ""wet face first"" and then use the cleanser but when I did that it just felt like I was washing away the product and not actually getting anything on my skin. So I decided to just put it on my dry face instead and rub it in for a minute or two and the wash it off, that seemed to work better for me. It does make my face soft and that's about the only good thing for me about it. I definitely would never try to use this if I was wearing makeup to try and get it off and wash my face, there is no way that would ever work. I just honestly don't know why people like this product so much.....It doesn't smell good either, and I still have to keep another cleanser on hand to take my makeup off. Not worth it for me.",0
Really refreshing,1
There is no shampoo better than this shampoo and conditioner.  I am a swimmer and put my long hair through the mill with my daily swim of 2 1/2 hours.  My hair was feeling like straw (really) and pureology saved my hair.  I will always be 'totally devoted' to this stuff!  My hair is soft and strong once more.  It is better than the stuff specifically made for swimmers... it is the best.  The smell is great and it is really worth the money if you want the best (besides you use very little anyway).,1
Good produuct!,1
Love it! Its not heavy or sticky and it lasts.,1
"Amazing fragrance, the product is very refreshing and energize the body, really value the money, speciLly in this big size",1
Good product to use for cleaning air brush after use rather than using water alone. Doesn't require much product to clean.,1
"Well, I didn't do the due dilligence I should've.  Found out, after the fact, that this contains: spearmint, wintergreen, and eucalyptus oils.  Imagine my surprise the first time I used this.

I imagine this is probably what caused the burning sensation for so many reviewers.  It's incredibly strong and made my eyes water.  I tried it a few times, to see if maybe it was just the initial shock and I might acclimate after a few washes, but no.  It still stung far too much for me to tolerate leaving it on the suggested amount of time.

My skin certainly felt clean afterwards, and there's no red coloration left afterwards... but that mix of oils was just far too much for my personal taste.  Maybe if they scaled back a bit, I might consider trying it again.",0
"One tube lasted me 3 months of daily application (face only). There's no nasty sunscreen smell, and it's lightweight. Feels decently moisturizing without being greasy. There is a slight white cast after applying, but it seems to dissipate as it absorbs (about 10 minutes).

The only detractor is it leaves my face SUPER shiny...as in enough that a friend commented on it. ""Dewy"" would be an understatement. It's not a problem if you're applying makeup over it, but I'd suggest a different product if you want a more natural or matte finish without makeup.",1
I like Oribe products.  My daughter first bought them for me for my thinning hair.  They do help me manage my hair.,1
Tip is way too small.  hard to hold onto!,0
"This is a gloss, not a liquid lipstick. It is gloopy and doesn't really cover well. Not really at all what I thought I was buying.",0
"this is my third time buy this stuff. I love it a lot. the smell, the cleanness, the color. All great",1
"I think this mascara worked great.  Unlike the other recent reviewers, my product was not dry or clumpy at all.  It stayed on exactly as claimed and didn't cause a problem w/ my rigid hard contact lenses.  Stayed on through rainstorm at outdoor concert.  Other waterproof mascara tends to smear under my eyes I think b/c my lids are kind of oily but this didn't.",1
"Great hair mask, make my hair super soft. Will buy it again",1
I was disappointed with this conditioner.  The scent is pleasant but it didn't condition or soften enough.  It almost seemed as if it was an imitation and left my hair feeling like I used hotel conditioner.  Kelly,0
"This is my first experience with any Proraso product, and I am happy I gave it a shot. The pros are it's easy to lather, nice thick lather, provided good protection, and was nice and slick. Now the cons it smells a little off to me, but that might just be the eucalyptus in it as its my first experience with it. You can definitely feel the menthol in it after applying to you face. All in all I would recommend this product, I will be buying the Proraso Tin after I use this up.",1
I have been using this product for 8 weeks now with no noticeable difference. Jane iredale recommends taking it for a full 14 weeks. I will give it another month or two and will update my review.,0
"This is not the real perfume.  Save your money.  Also, they don't take returns, so now I'm left with a paid for big bottle of perfume that I'll never wear.",0
"It's my first time trying Nioxin. And I already love it! Yes, there is definitely a strong minty smell and feel to it. Very refreshing, in my opinion. My hair has never felt better. My scalp is happy and my hair is deliciously flowy! Very happy with the results.  I will definitely come back for a refill.",1
I tried this product and for me it dried my  lips and didn't really last for very long. I thought a lip stain should last longer.,0
"Works great, can dry out your skin and it is pink so I only use at bedtime.",1
"The day it arrived I was so excited to use it based on the one review it received.  It came already sharpened, so I began to apply it and the tip snapped off. Oh well I thought, I will re-sharpen it and try again.  So I re-sharpened it and began to apply it and the tip fell off again!  This happened 4 times before I figured out that I was going to have to only sharpen it until it was just above the wood or it was going to snap off time after time.  So now I am forced to use it barely sharpened, which means the supporting wood is hitting/scratching your eyelid and you know how comfortable THAT is.  It also means that I don't get a nice, smooth line, since I don't have a sharpened point so the color ""skips"".  I would not recommend this to anyone and will not be buying again.",0
"Scent is little bit sharp like Axe ""Phoenix."" In the beginning, I even wanted to return it back but later changed my mind. And it is not so bad after all. Very good at soothing skin.",1
"These are not Clarisonic brand brushes. I've been using the Clarisonic system for years, and the bristles on these brushes are a different density and texture (and color) than those on the Clarisonic brushes. I felt the difference immediately when I tried to use these brushes.",0
"Nice smelling. Doesn't seem to have any amazing benefits on the skin, though.",1
It wasn't in the bottle shown above.  It was in a black bottle with a more generic label.  Perfume smells the same but when giving as a gift it looked like I found a cheaper generic version which was not true.,0
It does it's job and yes I realize it says small travel size but I didn't realize it meant minute.,1
Soft scent . Love this !!!,1
Good stuff.,1
Used to use the clarosonic for years and after just a few weeks using the Luna I can say it is so much better. Definetly recommend for all skin types,1
"its Worth, don't sting my eyes and stay all day long",1
"Product seems good. I didn't realize how tiny the tube is until it arrived. I mean, just one measly ounce for $18? That's the equivalent of $2,304 per gallon. That's quite some aftershave.",0
Nice! Very nice indeed!,1
"WOW! This product is perfect for those who have oily skin! It's lightweight and moisturizing. It does not break me out and my skin feels balanced. It's cheaper here on Amazon than it would be at Target.com. One star took down because it only lasts me 1 month (used it 2x a day, every day for a month) which makes this item pretty dam pricey if you're using it everyday!! However, I highly recommend it!",1
This is not the product I received. I got a different bottle and I'm pretty sure it's a generic soap in it. I have used this product regularly for more than a year. The seal was there but it's nothing like the same stuff I bought previously. It smells like baby soap or jergens.,0
"Great conditioner, but expected a wow factor for $49..",1
Fragrance way too strong and the product is overpriced.  Otherwise it is fine.,0
I am returning this item--I bought it from a grocery instead. It made my hair sticky! I think it's an imitation.,0
"Works great, but wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews about the tip getting so hot. It's very small and doesn't leave any room to grab it. Already burned my fingers.",1
"The item arrived in great condition.  However, I do not care for the hair spray.  It produces a very strong odor that does not go away in the air or the hair.  Also, it doesn't have a very good hold unless you really use a lot.  It's a very light hold, which for me is not what I need.",0
It's fake ....,0
Nice looking pencil and good color but wipes right off.  Not water or smudge proof as stated.,0
This powder is so light but covers very well. most people can't even tell that I'm wearing makeup. It evens out my skin flawlessly. I can't stand to wear heavy makeup on my face. this is a great price and it gets delivered to my door! Perfect,1
In my humble opinion.....best hair spray out there!  I have fine hair and it hold well without weighing it down!,1
"This is my favorite long wear lipstick! It is creamy and has a pleasant, faint sent that fades quickly.  This lipstick does not crack and dry out my lips like other dual long wears I have tried.",1
Swithed from Williams to Proraso,1
"I really love this!! Put it in when out of the shower and it helps (or if you've been swimming, my hairs always dry after swimming and it helps) the only down side is it makes it look greasy if you put too much in",1
"Face feel a strong tingling sensation, the whole piece is red, direct allergies",0
"Although this item looks, packaged well, and even somewhat smells like the real one, this is a FAKE.  At best, this is a watered down version of a real one. The real product is much thicker and does not run when you place it upside down. I bought the same one at local salon for the same price (after shipping). Buy it at your own risk..",0
i have very fine hair and even a very small amount of this dried it out too much,0
"The wipes felt pretty good on my face, but they smell terrible, kind of like rotten eggs. I will not be using these.",0
Tried this in the store and bought the 7 ounce tube for $35.  It is amazing stuff.  It leaves your skin feeling completely clean and clear after every use.  I liked it so much I returned the $35 ounce tube and bought this 17 ounce jar for two dollars more on Amazon.  Amazon has such great prices they can't be beat.  I am surprised I have never heard of this product before and am recommending it to everyone I know.  It is not your typical mud mask....actually improves the look of your skin in numerous ways.  I use it several times a week just because it makes my skin look and  feel wonderfully refreshed!,1
"I bought this dryer as a gift for someone but whenever I have a chance I use it also because it's so awesome.

Pros: Makes my hair soft and less frizzy. Takes less time to dry my hair using this dryer. Light weight.

Cons: The one downfall is the attachment falls off easily if you grab it by the attachment. It is not snug at all.only reason I'm giving it 4 stars versus 5.",1
Love this product but package was opened and looked used! Disgusting!!,0
"This is a quality product that does an excellent job covering blemishes and evening out the skin. It's a little heavy for my personal preference during daytime use, but I like it for nighttime as it looks more natural away from harsh sunlight, at least on my fair skin. Otherwise, a very good product that does exactly as promised.",1
Ditto to all other reviews !!!!!,0
"My baby's cradle cap is more like a small glob of gunk here and there rather than thin crusties all over. The ""glob"" is a bit thick and this didn't work on it. Maybe best for the thinner crustier type of cradle cap.",0
Deep red..... peels too easily,0
The bottle I have leaks oil all over when pumping on hair. It also leaves a strange sticky freel in the hair that makes it hard to blow dry and style. I have used Argan oil for quite a while and never had this problem before.,0
I like it better than WEN.  Smells great and leaves hair silky but so greasy feeling like WEN did when I used it for several months on my hair.  I would buy it again.,1
Makes my hair feel like I have a build up on it and it bothered my scalp.  The light brown is too dark too.,0
Love the smell of deep sea minerals & Japanese mint. Leaves my hair feeling soft and smelling good. I will definitely buy again.,1
Does what it is suppose to do,1
I have oily skin but this mask still works perfect. It's less strong than the green one which is perfect. It left my skin brighter and tender every time after I applied it. One of the best masks I have ever tried. Highly recommend.,1
The last purchase was somehow tainted. I don't know if it spoiled or just isn't the original product. Very expensive to be a knock off or inferior.,0
OUUVERRRATED!!!!!,0
"It arrived fast, but it looked old and it smelled old as well... was looking forward to trying it out. Quite a bummer to pay this kind of money and receive and old product. It smelled aweful ( like plastic) so I did not even use it!",0
"Love this product! It really helps freshen up your hair. It has a bit of a ""lemoney"" smell to it. I took one star off because the product can make dark hair look a little whitish if the product is not blended in well enough and because at times the powder is so fine that it can kind of get all over the place. Overall I really like the product and will continue to purchase!",1
This was a Birthday Gift for a Very Special Person I love the way it makes him Smell and it last the smell stays with him and the sheets  Thank You,1
"I like this product and I don't like this product. It did clear up my acne but it does dry my face out until all the cells have turned over. Once I have all new skin and I keep using the product I seem to get red splotchy looking skin around my nose and mouth areas...  Which I was happy to live with because it was better than acne but it still didn't give me the ideal skin I was hoping for. And my skin was constantly dry. In order to combat the dryness and the peeling I would take hot showers and in the shower after my skin had softened from the hot water I would take my clean hands and rub my face and the dead skin would come off. This helped the overall appearance of the skin. I also bought Mario Badescu Glycolic cleanser and I actually like it better. It seems less harsh when you wash your face compared to Jan Marini but it actually works magic overnight. The next day I have completely dry and somewhat peeling skin that I can shower and take it all off with and it feels much more gentle than Jan Marini. Jan Marini needs to be used for a few days to see results while Mario doesnt. I now have stopped using Jan Marini and it sits in my cabinet and I use an awesome normal face cleanser that clears up my acne which I love (called NanoCleanse, you can read my review for it) and for exfoliation or cell turnover once every two weeks or so I will use Mario.

I finally love my skin after 24 years

2 stars because it wasn't the best but it is a glycolic cleanser and did clear up my acne even though other products did a better job and didn't leave me with red areas",0
excellent!!!,1
Excellent quality and is easy to apply coverage. Color is actually more normal than prior bottles.,1
I really like it and will buy more,1
I love this stuff. it is the best cuticle remover I have found I will keep using it. The end,1
"This oil effectively tames and softens facial hair. The dropper is convenient and a few drops more than suffice. The aroma is unique. There is a strong sweet musky tone as well as crisper notes of pine, cedar, menthol  an eucalyptus. It is masculine and vaguely medicinal but not unpleasant. Use judiciously because it can overwhelm and it does linger. Even though formulated with oils, it does not make hair look or feel greasy. It is a good product if somewhat strongly fragranced.",1
"My wife bought these rollers 8 months ago and she liked the curls that she got from them. However, the plastic used for these are literally falling apart. This is not from impact or dropping them. They are just disintegrating, I suppose from the heat. 4 roller have fallen apart already at the time of this post. They are an expensive set. Do not buy.",0
"I got this cream for my dry skin. This is great and has done wonders. My skin is no longer dry. The only downside is, I thought it would work with my break out prone skin. Don't get me wrong, this product did not make my break outs worse, but I do notice a few more break outs here and there. Besides that, this is a great product with a nice scent.",1
I wish it was a darker shade but it really is a fantastic product. My skin looks and feels great.,1
"Was disappointed to have to return this lipstick, it gave an uncomfortable burning sensation on the lips and I immediately sent it back knowing I could never wear it.  I do have some make-up sensitivities but I never had a burning lipstick before. Maybe it will be different for you. Was worried that it wouldn't be an acceptable return having used it once but Amazon did refund the purchase, so I was very glad of that.",0
Doesnt clean face. Wayyyyyyy to soft,0
"This dried my face out. Did nothing to set my make up. Did not look dewey either.
Very disappointed.  This was suggested by my clinician. It does smell good but very drying.
Going to try another brand.",0
It's soooooo small!,0
"Terrible. One of the worst cleansers I have ever used. The rank, chemical odor is extremely off putting. It did nothing but dry me out horribly, which just worsened the quality of my skin and caused a new breakout. So far, I've hated every product from Avene; they seem to either make their cleansers ultra-drying or so basic and creamy that they don't cleanse your skin but instead leave a pore-clogging film behind. I'll never order from this crappy company again.",0
Nice consistency but not anything special.,0
goos,1
"I don't care for the scent at all. Smells very floral. Not what I expected for something called ""Ocean Front""",0
according to sister it was ok,1
Its a nice scent in the shower but doesnt stay on your skin once you are out.  Its not a bad product just not worth the $$.  I was just as happy with my dove body wash for $6.00.,0
"The bottle is terrible. After 1 pump all the cream stays between the nozzle and opening. I needed to tap the bottle ion my dresser to get it to come out.

Product wise, it's just ok since I haven't had too much time to state results.

The bottle is bad design.",0
Takes the itch out and smooths the skin!  Super! Relentlee,1
"Unhappy with this because the lid does not tighten down and I bought it specifically for travel.  It came in a wet paper wrap (because it leaked), wrapped in bubble wrap, in a box.  I'm missing about 1/3 of the product due to this.  I love Elemis but this is unfortunate, especially for the cost.  I will put it in another bottle and won't purchase again.",0
Its a great product easy to apply it's a little bit expensive and is glossy  so I  like it .,1
"Minimum scent, greasy oil (castor and olive oil mainly), didn't feel any main difference between using and not using it. I won't buy again, it's just a waste of money.",0
These are my favorite curling irons...heat up fast ..work great...last a long time...however the one I got from here was gummy and sticky....like it was sitting in a hot warehouse too long and melted a bit...the handle..couldn't touch it was nasty..I returned with no hassle however...purchased somewhere else,0
"When it arrived the color was incorrect and the smell is drastically different. A little research says that the manufacturer is no longer supporting internet sales only sales through local stores, meaning that this is counterfeit.

On the plus side it is still shampoo and seemed to do a good job for the few days it was used but the smell is not good.",0
these towels work if you need to tan your legs for an event where you will be wearing shorts  or a skirt but they are pricey for everyday use.  Also the tan is slightly orange.,1
"It was given as a gift to my granddaughter and she is very happy with it.  She has waist long hair and it works perfectly for her.
Will be buying another one for the other granddaughter as a gift.",1
"A must buy if you have milk shake purple shampoo.. hair is soft and feels great. Will buy again, same price in store, so will buy off prime for convenience.",1
"Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo was recommended by my hair stylist after I complained about dry itchy scalp that I had experienced for several years.  After a couple weeks using this shampoo, the condition was much improved.  Since I had seen my dermatologist several times about dry itchy scalp and had tried several prescription remedies that did not help, I was pleasantly surprised that this ""off the shelf"" product worked so well.  And it smells great too!",1
This is a good blush brush - but the handle is a bit long for control/contouring. Nice feel to bristles - and requires light hand for application as this brush picks up pigmentation very well.,1
This product does not work.,0
Does not hold a curl in my hair at all,0
"Cost is too much for the results received from the product. I have been using it since it arrived, per the directions, and have seen no difference.",0
"My initial reason for buying this was due to the high cost of AOS pre-shave, and wow I'm glad I did! It literally makes me feel their is a protective layer on my face as I shave using a DE razor. The oil is a bit thick, so just use a little.",1
I JUST RECEIVE T THIS MAKE UP REMOVER AND  THE ONLY THINK I LIKE IS: VERY GENTLE TO SKIN BUT DOES NOT REMOVE THE MASCARA EASY . I USED COTTON AND I USED THE PRODUCT DIRECTLY TO THE LASHES BUT I STILL HAVE MASCARA,0
Half way thru the first bottle of 2 that i bought the shampoo appeared to be grayish and slimy- def not going to use the rest of this bottle.  I buy this product all the time and have always liked it. I'm actually going to call Paul Mitchell and report this to them also.,0
There wasn't even a moose in the bottle. Like c'mon man. Get to it. My man. All right. C'mon man.,0
"This product is absolutely amazing! I love it. It smells good and makes my hair less frizzy, just like it should. :)",1
"I recently purchased this product on a recommendation from a friend.  I gave it to my husband for Christmas - we both like the scent but can never smell it even a few minutes after he has applied it.  It seems no matter how much he uses neither of us can smell it after it's on him, even on his clothes.  Even though the fragrance in the bottle is classic and subtle, it's very ineffective if you can't smell it at all.",0
"This product is fraudulent! As others have stated, the product has different packaging than the real product and causes more severe irritations. Really think twice before you purchase this product because your eyes and the skin around your eyes are extremely sensitive.

You don't want to be applying harsh chemicals that haven't been approved and regulated.",0
"The saying ""you have to use it for it to work"" is completely true with this product. This nail growth polish is the best I've used, but that is the catch....you HAVE to use it as it says. Only downfall (or I wold have given 5 stars) once I quit using the product, my nails go right back to brittle & break. I just wish it would help strengthen them in general.",1
It smells great and works fine. I am debating if this.,1
Terrible!!! If you want to have an OVERNIGHT breakout this is what you need. I've never had a breakout in my life. Not sure if this is a knockout or not I would NOT buy this!,0
"I can't help but feel like I received a fake product. Reading through these reviews and the ingredients list I don't smell a thing. It has a very, very light chemical smell. Like a regular cleanser. Otherwise, you can't detect a scent and knowing korean products they love to add perfume or something to give the product a good scent. After application the product makes my skin feel tacky and sticky.",0
"Since its not safe for the lungs to use baby powder, this baby perfume is fun to put on the outside of our babys diaper or onsey and he still has that sweet baby powder smell!",1
"This is a decent option to cover up scars. I have some small scars that are fairly new and still sort of red and purple while they heal. This foundation stick helps them blend in with my normal skin. It goes on thick and requires a few coats. It doesn't make my skin look flawless, but it makes my scars look better than they did, not so easily noticeable. It washes off fine with a bit of soap and scrubbing in the shower. I have fair skin and even this lightest shade was a little bit dark for my skin, but like I said, it's works okay to hide my scars.",1
"I bought this because it was a recommendation from a friend....Best recommendation ever, lol. Follow the directions and you cannot go wrong, I always give myself extra time to dry my nails because they will be dry but not hard and still have the ability to smudge.",1
"I purchased this product from Ulta; however I wanted to post about the product. I have untouched natural hair and wanted to buy volumizing shampoo/conditioner. After a month of use, hair became brittle and broke off. Additionally, turned red/orange. My hair is completely damaged!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!",0
Not as pigmented as similar products by tarte or pixi. Was hoping this could be an eco dupe for the peach pixi concealor/corrector in a pot. Very disappointing. Does almost nothing for my extremely dark circles,0
"I bought my first Hot Tools curling iron 18 months ago locally. The thermostat went out in six months.  It was stuck on high and burned my hair off. Hot tools would replace it but I had to pay a five dollar fee plus shipping both ways to get a new one. Adding in some kind of mailer I could get one at Amazon (a prime member) for almost the same cost. I got one from Amazon in August of 2015. Two days before Christmas 2016,  it burned the ends of my hair off.  It was set on the medium setting as was the first iron. I really liked the curling iron but I am giving up on Hot Tools. I am giving it a one star due to it's unreliability.",0
I feel like if I got my shirt wet and rubbed it on my face it would do about the same thing.,0
"This is a fake product. The bottle is real, the liquid isnt.",0
"Great cleanser for acne, my son is on his 4th bottle",1
"I live in high altitude, and I am a Cosmetologist. My skin is usually a combination depending on the time of year. I am currently pregnant, and my skin is very dry and sensitive right now. I am glad I tried this cleanser, it works for me at this time. I currently wear a little concealer, under my eyes, brow pencil, eyeliner, mascara, and a little cream blush. I believe it works best at removing minimal makeup, but I would not recommend it for those who wear a full face of makeup. I did decide to purchase a separate eye makeup remover. So far I have not had any issues, as this keeps my skin soft and non-irritated. However, when my skin returns to ""normal"" I will probably finish using this up as a morning cleanser, and go back to a Combination cleanser for nighttime.",1
"First of all, you don't need as much as normal concealer so just put the tip of your finger over the opening and try to get just a teeny tiny bit. You'd be surprised how far this goes and it covers superbly! Pat that finger gently back and forth under the eye and then blend. This could easily last a year ;) If you are thinking about buying it and have been using the cheapo concealer or another brand, just give it a try, I doubt you'll be disappointed!",1
This stuff is great - really controls my acne,1
It worked okay for the first couple of months but now it shuts off after 5 minutes of use. You have to keep pushing the on button every few minutes to stop it from getting cold,0
"This is the least user friendly at home permanent straightener I have ever used. It expects you to have the knowledge of someone who's attended beauty school and expects you to have bought all the other products they include in their instructions to undo the damage this does to your hair. My hair got slightly straighter, but not to the extent of the dramatic transformation on the box. Unless you plan to buy this and take it to a professional salon to have it done, I don't recommend buying it.",0
"It smells bad enough to where I can't stand it on my face. I'm not sure if it's supposed to smell this bad or that I just got a bad one, but it smells like you didn't dry your towels for weeks after washing them. Package arrived late. Although the product had a plastic wrapping around it, the moisturizer had leaked out around the container. If it wasn't for the smell I'd give this product 4 stars. 5 stars if it also didn't arrive late and leaking.",0
"I actually really like how it works. The replacement filters, on the other hand, do not fit this device which makes it useless and a waste of money. Is there a way to buy replacement filters that actually fit this device? I wasted money buying the suggested replacements on top of a device that can only be used a handful of times before the filters need to be replaced.

I hope someone reads this and helps me out.",0
"My teeth are whiter. That's what the product said
would happen. I will continue to use it in the future.",1
"Love the color, With no top coat it does not last more than 3 days.",1
It seemed to work. This is an ongoing process.,1
Amazing! I could go 3-4 extra days without washing my hair! Smells great!,1
I team broken and nail polish all over. Waiting to hear from company.,0
"I think this stuff is amazing. My eye lids are noticeably lifted by morning when I use this at night. A little goes a long way, so a tube will last a long time. I had switched to ROC because it was cheaper and often goes for sale buy one get one free or half off. It is a good product. I see some lift when I use it, but StriVectin is that much better that it is worth the extra cost. Small tubes last me a couple of months and I put it on up just past my brow, over the eye area and beneath.",1
"They use this flat iron at the salon I go to and it's great, however I purchased it to curl my hair but ended up sending it back because the plates do not touch unless you press firmly. I hair thick, frizzy hair so I require a lot of heat to smooth it out but the iron is super light. It weighs like nothing! I think that's why you have to press hard for the plates to meet but then it snags the hair. Overall, if you're purchasing to use on someone else's hair.. Go for it. It really is a great product but if you have thick frizzy hair that you want to curl, you might want to get something with a little more weight.",0
love it,1
Overpriced.,0
have not seen results yet..everyone bragged about it so I bought it..,1
Don't waste your money. Does not stay put at all!,0
"I have never used this brand before so I plan to come back and re-evaluate the rating depending on if it is better or worse the current rating.  It comes in an easy to squeeze bottle and looks like a blue gel when you apply it to your skin. I have an extremely dry area on both of my forearms and although some moisturizers work better than others, nothing has solved the problem. I am applying my best moisturizing cream first and then this serum to lock in the mositurizer;

It has no smell for which I am glad and stretched to cover the whole area. If this takes care of my problem, I will gladly pay the price for this serum.",1
Great color.,1
"I enjoyed the cream soothing, rich, seemed to work.",1
Diluted - This is a product that I have been purchasing for at least 10 years and am very familiar with.  I did notice there was one person that mentioned it may be diluted and she was CORRECT!  There is no way this product is full strength Paul Mitchell.  I decided to try to find a supplier online since I do much of my shopping this way and have purchased often from Amazon.  This is the first seller I have encountered that sold something that was not as described and up to this point the seller hasn't even responded to my complaint.,0
"I recently bought this item after reading others review. I have long, puffy (not curly hair), medium volume of hair. I would say that his dryer really works for my hair and well worth it, it takes me 10 mins to dry my hair as suppose to 15-30 on my old hair dryer. No frizzyness and dry damage hair. Very light weight and not much noise.

However, In my opinion, if you have really, really curly hair and thick hair, this might not be the right one for you. I think it depends on your hair.

For those who have puffy hair, long and medium volume hair like mine, I would defenitely recommend it.",1
Wife love this product.,1
"I first tried this product in Copenhagan at a spa.  It was amazing and I just built a spa at home.  To complete my spa shower experience, I ordered the product from Amazon and their delivery was great- product is wonderful.",1
The price was great.  The packaging was fine and arrived on time!!  This product works well for short hair. Spray sparingly.,1
I use it every day in the evenings and it really works.  It keeps my face clear and oil free and has been a big factor in eliminating some adult onset acne.,1
"This a good, solid men's skin line. The liquid face wash has no odor and foams up nicely when a little is mixed with water. It feels nice against the skin and is not drying. The astringent has a minty odor, combined with that of Witch Hazel. The skin cream has no odor, like the face wash, so you don't have to worry about any odors mixing with your cologne or aftershave. The packaging is very basic, with labels that are easy to read. The pump on the face wash did not work when first trying it. I had to remove the cap, and with a little maneuvering, the pump portion did pop up, so I was able to use it. This is useful for normal to dry skin. The products aren't strong enough for oily or acne skin.",1
I have waisted my money and time. I had been using this comb for past 2 years....NO USE!!!Now I stopped to use that. I believe all the good reviews are written by the manufacture itself..please don't buy this..don't waist your money and time.,0
Lovely color and formula! It also got to my location really quickly. Definitely a must have in your collection. :),1
"Love this toner for ease, smell, and it really does well after a shower to skin in and set a good base before I apply skin care. Great first step.",1
This diffuser does not even fit the matching blow dryer.,0
"How does this thing have so many good reviews?! This was one of my worst purchases ever. First, it doesnt really get very hot. Maybe I got a defective one, but it takes forever to dry my hair. It is quite powerful, but all it really does is wildly blow my hair around making it a tangled mess. The temp and speed controls are also awful. While drying my hair, Im constantly flipping them and changing the temp and speed. I literally despise this hair dryer. I dread drying my hair everyday and I only continue to use it because I spent $90 on the thing.",0
Smells AMAZING!  I use this right before drying my hair (just 4 spritzes) and this little bottle will last quite some time.,1
"I purchased this curling iron in October and really liked it.  However, after three months of use, it no longer works. It appears to be in pristine condition.  I have used curling irons for 35 years, and most lasted several years.  Through Amazon, I contacted the seller, HOUSEWEARS, and they informed me (in broken English) that the warrantee is one month.  The Hot Tools web site states that there is a 6 month warrantee on these particular curling irons.  Don't waste your money.",0
Damaged bottle. Product comes out every where but the nozzle.,0
"I have medium tones of Southeast Asian ethnicity. My skin is in the warm class with yellow undertones.

I have never before tried powder foundation  mostly because I didn't think it would stay put or would cover very much. I was pleasantly surprised by the Intense Powder Camo. It comes with a round sponge, which has its own compartment in the bottom of the compact but I just keep it stashed on top of the powder itself. I tried the 35W Toast and the 50W Honey, both of which are in the warm class; however, the Honey was too dark for me. Toast is just right.

According to the instructions, for medium coverage, apply with a powder brush. For full coverage, apply with the sponge. I prefer the sponge because it seems to get more product on my skin. I like to pat all over my face and then blend a little with the sponge. It is buildable; if you aren't satisfied with the coverage of any discoloration or acne or scars, just keep patting more product on until it fully conceals. But do not forget to blend so that the powder looks even. The powder is dense and does stay put, especially if you finish your makeup off with the setting spray.

Although it works well with uneven skin tones, acne and scars, I found that it didn't really fill in large pores nor do a satisfactory job with dark undereye areas. Even with a primer, my large pores still showed up. As for the undereye, I had to use a cream concealer to do the job. For that I recommend using the Dermablend Blurring Mousse Camo.",1
THE BEST! I am a greasy mess and would end up with raccoon eyes at the end of the day. This product stays put and creates a beautifully neat line. I love it!,1
"A product I have used for years on my face and neck and have wonderful results. I now augment it with Olay Regenerist at night and think it adds some punch to keep from developing lines and wrinkles. Having entered my 8tyh decade, I am told frequently that I look years younger than I am. Nice to hear, but really like the way this product feels and performs.",1
never trust it as magic as the advertisement shows....barely work even you have some hair on the top....the powder just didn't stick to the scalp at all..NOT Recommend to purchase...,0
Good for kid's skin.......,1
I absolutely love Pink Sugar.  It was a great price for a great product.,1

"This is very nice for a facial mask.i have combination skin (a slightly oily forehead and the rest is dry skin). Applied to my cheeks and chin, this works well. I left it on for 5 Minutes and removed it with absorbent cotton pads. It left my skin feeling tingly and fresh while it tended to remove the impurities on my skin. My face appeared brighter and smoother and looked pretty nice for sort of old (no wrinkles here) skin that has seen too much sun and has been exposed to the elements.
The end result was there was increased hydration in the dry, patchy areas. Very nice! If you have had trouble achieving a good balance on patchy skin, I'd suggest you give this product a try for hydration and increased elasticity.",1
I have been using OBAGI products for about ten years. I like this container because you pump out just the right about to use.,1
Doesn't do much for me during the day.  Wouldn't buy again.,0
"This is fake do not buy!! It's the same price on Mario Badescu website!! When it came it had white opaque bubbles in it and when I squeezed some in my hand it came out milky because of the bubbles, please just save your skin and mind the worry and buy it from the actual sight",0
Couldn't get it open to fill it.  I had some help destroying it. Never mind : the little shaker was good enough.,0
"The Calvin Klein Eternity is a new favorite in our house. It has a clean, fresh and masculine smell and though it feels strong when you just put it on, the aftershave smell fades away faster than a Cologne. My husband has sensitive skin and some aftershaves have irritated his skin in the past so he is always weary to try new ones but this one was not irritating to his skin at all. Love this and would definitely repurchase.",1
I have been using this for about a month. Smell is terrible--almost like chemicals. Also haven't noticed much difference in my hair. Disappointed.,0
"Our baby developed a rash and severe dry skin around her mouth from chewing on her strap.  We tried a few other products that didn't work to clear the rash and severe dry skin.  After applying this product for a few days the rash and dry skin slowly dissipated.  After a week, it was completely clear.  We really like this product and will continue to use and purchase it!",1
"I purchased this brand of nail polish because it is ""5-free"". The color on the nails is pretty, a spring-ish pink, but when applied to the nail, it comes out streaky - almost like I'm painting my nails with white out (but not as ugly). I use RGB base coat, and then a top coat and the essie quick dry drops as I do with all other polishes, but this one just doesn't come out right.",0
Great after shave. A bit pricey but high quality and unscented. It may have a mild scent at first but it quickly goes away and I prefer it way more to other heavily scented after shave. Glad I bought it for my fianc. Although he says it doesn't give him the feeling of closing his pores like other products he has used before.,1
My wife uses this for her 90 year old mother.  She has slight thinning hair and these fiber really do a great job filling ing in here and there and you can't tell.  My wife bought the special top for application.  It works great.  I'm not kidding.,1
"I always have chapped lips. I naturally have sensitive and dry skin so even if I'm hydrated and even exfoliate my lips, they still get chapped very quickly. I tried Chapstick, Vaseline, EOS, and Rose Salve; they moisturize only as long as they are on, once they're gone, chapped lips again.

The only comparable product to my JB balm was Urban Decay's Lip Love (the one with honey which is sadly discontinued). This is the only lip product I have that will actually heal my chapped lips and make them soft again. The scent is lovely and a little goes a long way. I wish I could get more product for the price, but it's the best that I have so far.",1
Excellent service.  Fast delivery. I was surprised to find safety razor blades on Amazon.  I was surprised to find them anywhere for that matter. Thanks!,1
"I would love to return this awful item, but it is too much trouble even though the price was outrageous. Dry Shampoos are hard to find, and good ones even harder. Do not buy this one. After spraying on the hair, it blobbed in one place, making it difficult to brush through the hair. In fact, it was impossible.",0
"I loved this wand when I used my sister's.  However, the one i received from this company didn't work at all - wouldn't even turn on.  I ended up buying the same wand, but paid more directly through the company itself to ensure I was getting a good product",0
"Not sure what was inside this.  Been using this gel for awhile and it is a clearish gel, when I received this and used it.  It was white, and felt like hand cream.",0
Terrible scent,0
"What a sucker I was to fall for this waste of money.  Doesn't curl lashes AT ALL.  All those reviews that say ""just press harder"" ?  Hahaha yeah, right.  Big and uncomfortable next to your eye.  Impossible to see what you are doing. Absolutely the worst, most useless product ever.  Just don't.",0
"I've tried a lot of products for my acne through the years, some of them very expensive. I visited a dermatologist desperate because despite of the good products I was using I didn't see any result. She recommended me this one, and since the first week I saw the change in my skin. I haven't had a breakout since I'm using it, even when I'll get my period maybe I get one or two pimple. Finally after many years fighting with the acne breakouts my skin looks good.",1
Great value!,1
just okay.  I've had a a Conair from a pharmacy that produced more power.,1
"Got it thru Scentbird and smells lime Curve, just not for me.",0
"Way too harsh for my sensitive skin. I am spoiled by other luxury brands and just can't go back couldn't wait to get the moisturizer on my face. Gave it away to my sister in law, who has tougher skin lol",0
Good coverage-blends well,1
It takes too long to cover the patches. The colour was too dark for brown. It was like black. It cannot be used for large areas of baldness.,0
The color shown here is darker ...toucan do it is bright orange!,0
"I ordered this palette it's came broken and the shadow sparse all over the palette, but I used it anyway. I'm very disappointed.",0
Is good I like it,1
Excelente,1
"I was under the impression I ordered the one without guides, Also a blde was to be included but received an empty package,",0
Overpowering smell I can't get past.,0
"Great product, came away with curls which lasted all day. Hair feels healthy which is not always the case with curl inducing shampoos.",1
Love this !!! Much gentler than other micellaire waters that Ive tried,1
This is my first time purchase of R-Co shampoo . Just another regular shampoo. I would not spend so much money on this product .,0
"Considering all the hype, I guess I expected more from this shampoo. I don't care for the smell at all. For $40 I would think they could find a better fragrance. It cleans my hair ok, but it gets oily quicker. I suppose it doesn't strip the hair as much as a regular shampoo since it is trying to preserve color... which is ok I guess since I wash my hair everyday anyway. My hair does feel thicker/fuller after blow drying. Probably won't buy it again.",1
Smells amazing!!! Just like a baby should smell.,1
"I'm a huge fan of this brand and this product is my go to travel eyeshadow. I'm all about basic, natural look. This one got it! Also love the Meet Matte palette.",1
"Heavy, not hot enough and stopped working within 8 months of use. For the price it should last longer.",0
Love the way this leaves my hair feeling. So smooth and luxurious. However on my gray hair it seems to be leaving that awful orangeish  brassy tone. This so saddens me because I love the feel of my hair after using it. Can't you make it for gray hair also ???,1
Small pack,0
"This is not the real thing ,i agree it is water down  FAKE",0
"I am a big fan of EltaMD UV SPF 46, but this was the first time I purchased (by accident) the tinted version. The product goes on smooth and for a tinted moisturizer, I was surprised how much I liked it at first. However, within a few days of using this, I started breaking out and it causes the redness in my skin to flair up. Doesn't really moistures either.",0
My hair wouldn't stay in the brush.  It's poorly designed. I returned it for a full refund.  The bristles aren't long enough.,0
Im 8 days in an nothing. My feet felt soft for a day and then back to rough skin. Im still waiting for any peeling.,0
"I noticed an immediate reduction in the redness on my chin, nose and cheeks just after using it for 3 days!  However since then it seems to have stayed the same, no further improvement. That's ok because the redness reduction was pretty significant. I do use it morning and night, and only need a little bit in targeted areas. I will buy this again when I run out.",1
"after laser treatment, this was suggested and work to repair and rebuild skin",1
"By far, my favorite liquid eyeliner for the perfect cat eye. Dark and pigmented and stays on most of the day. I have oily lids and this liner has outlasted any other liners I've tried. The only issue I have is you need to wait a bit for it to dry before you curl your lashes or the liner will smudge.",1
"I like to wear face lotion, sunblock and sometimes foundation (unless its a tinted moisturizer). I got this one because it seemed to have the four important things I care for: lotion, sunblock and tint (all for rosacea), but its really a tinted sunblock. If thats what you are looking for go for it, but if you need lotion beware this won't give it to you. Also the smell is really strong.",0
"Literally smells like toilet cleaner *gags* After reading the majority of positive reviews, I'm starting to question whether or not these people live in outhouses, a barn or maybe just a giant pile of burning garbage?!

Let's put it this way: If you don't like the smell of bathroom cleaners, then this is not the fragrance for you! If you do, then I highly recommend hitting up the cleaning product aisle at your local Walmart because Lysol and Febreze are cheaper... and actually smell a hell of a lot better then this crap! Ew.",0
Does not work as a UVA blocker,0
Love the color!!!! I ordered the wrong one but I'm happy i got this.!!!!,1
"This cream is an excellent hydrator.  I need something that works this well during the winter when my hands and elbows dry out like sandpaper.  I tiny dab is all you need and the effectiveness lasts a long time.  I find that using it twice per day is about all that I need.  The jar is very tiny - it almost looks like a sample but since you only use a little this should last at least a month.

It has no odor nor does it feel greasy.  This is another nice product from Vichy.",1
Don't waist money on this.,0
The scent isn't very good for this product. I like the original more. I stopped using this and started using canned shaving cream and found that I get the same results for much cheaper. I'm not really sure that Proraso is worth the money.,0
Looks great on fair skin.  I feel sexy with color.,1
It did not protect my skin from burning. It only had enough for 5 applications. I would not recommend.,0
"Good curling iron.  Very hot.  Very good price and quick delivery.  However, people with fine hair should not turn it any hotter than 325.",1
this product was given to me as a gift... I liked it so much I purchased more as soon as I ran out.  It's a bit masculine so my husband uses it.,1
"I'm particular about my skin care products and was looking for a high quality retinol. This one is fantastic. I have noticed my skin tighten, my fine lines seem to have diminished. I love this product. It does carry an unpleasant smell but it does not stick with you and regardless the product works like a gem is its definitely a keeper",1
I bought this flat iron and it worked great until 3 months into using this product. As I was using it it sparked fire from inside one of the plates.,0
"the product provided no noticeable results. I've been using it for 1-2 months now and I see no difference. My expectations were not too high when I bought it so I guess I'm not that disappointed that it didn't work. Oh well, I gave it a shot.",0
As expected.,1
"I've been using this almost daily for three weeks, and so far I'm disappointed. After reading reviews that some women saw a difference after just one use (on the side of the face treated with Nuface versus the untreated side), I had high hopes that I would see some kind of lifting effect by now.  No amount of ""facelifting"" creams or serums can change the structure of the face, but the idea of muscle simulation through micro current made me very hopeful. I'm 41 with slackening of the cheek area causing multiple nasolabial folds around my mouth.  This was my last hope (outside of a surgeon's office) to firm up the sagging ... I don't have jowls or anything severe, so I really thought this could help. Such a disappointment.
I'lol still keep using it for another couple months and will update if anything changes. For now though, I feel stupid for falling for another ""treatment""
The only  reason I didn't give it one star was it's relaxing and easy to use, but as for results, 1 star.",0
I bought this with the glytone rejuvenate cream step up 3 and like the cream better. This is probable a good product for anyone who doesn't want to use the glytone rejuvenating cream step 3 which i love,1
"I have naturally curly hair, but like to straighten it once in awhile and this I thought would be great for waves. Well, it was ...ONCE! I've only used it once and went to use it weeks later after I straightened my hair again and the light came on, but never heated up. SO DISAPPOINTED. Have always used Hot Tools products, but this is a disappointment for sure!",0
Have used this product for quite some time.  Good hold but still looks natural...not stiff.,1
The BaByliss PRO Nano Titanium hot rollers were quite a disappointment. They were so heavy they  wouldn't stay in my hair and I could not move around comfortably waiting for them to cool down. The size of the rollers were good but just too heavy.,0
"It works great until it doesn't work!  After very little use, my Mia stopped holding a charge and Clarisonic will not provide support without a receipt and proof of purchase in the last year.  Poorly made.  I recommend buying from a different company.  $120 down the drain....",0
Yellowy color not as pictured,0
"A big fan of Butter nail polish, I assumed I would also appreciate their eye stick. It was very dry, did not rub in, difficult to blend and very dark. Deeplyl disappointed and will not purchase again.",0
It's a great product and it does the job,1
"This brush does draw super thin lines just like I wanted. The tip is very slim and tapered, and appropriately stiff - perfect. But in my brush there is a really sharp hair/hairs that makes this painful to use. On my upper eyelid, it is somewhat tolerable, but on the lower eyelid this hair scrapes painfully against my skin to the point I just can't use it there. I think I will have to trash it. Does quality control not exist at Japonesque??? If that's the case then lower the price to $2 for this brush to match the quality of product you are providing.",0
"OMG it really works , reduces regrowth facial for 2 weeks  love the dispenser clean not messy , I just wish they didn't use parabens",1
"We've been trying to cut out as many chemicals in our products used at home, so we decided to try this. It smells nice, the consistency was odd, but rubbed in well and didn't seem to leave much greasy residue. We were in the sun at the beach for a few hours, reapplied every hour or directly after being in the water and my husband and I are both completely burnt. I will not be using this product again and am extremely disappointed that I bought two tubes.",0
works great,1
"Does help and would purchase again.  Use very sparingly.
Makes the skin feel so subtle and easier to put on makeup
without it showing all the wrinkles",1
"I just received Dermablend Setting Powder, but it is not the product from Vichy, on the bottom is written Dermablend L'Oreal USA, so it's not the real deal.",0
The mitt is cheaply made and is not needed at all. I would suggest a pair of gloves over this. It is a waste of money!,0
I get lots of compliments on this!,1
Pale neutral pink. Solid color after 2-3 coats.,1
Save your money. This didn't curl my eyelashes very well. I use curl my eyelashes and put on WATERPROOF mascara before-hand and I can BARELY tell a difference. Product feels very cheaply made as well. You would think with a price like this that you would get a well-made product that works well.,0
"This is a really nice exfoliating body soap.  I'm not a fan of men's bodywashes and liquid body soaps simply because I think they're gimmicky and don't work well, so I'm always on the lookout for a nice bar of soap.  So far this Baxter of CA bar is up there with the best of the best.  It cleans and exfoliates very well and leaves my skin with a very pleasant yet manly sent that lasts throughout the day.  My only issue is that it leaves my skin a little dry.  Don't get me wrong, if I'm at the level of skin care at which I'm using this brand of soap or something similar, then I should know to moisturize after getting out of the shower; however, that doesn't mean I need anything that will make my skin drier.  It's still a top notch soap, though.",1
Nice scent for a botanical. Economical. Less is needed than ordinary shampoos. I like it very much.,1
Doesn't give the shine you would expect from a gel and BOY IT'S A REAL FIRM HOLD!! Really wanted to love it but they need to add something to it that would add a nice shine to the hair that can last for a couple hours at least.,0
"Whatever positive you have read in previous ratings, ignore it!  This product does not sustain more than 4 hours of normal office work!  I was completely embarrassed when I began to smell the odor emitting from my armpits after lunch!  I love the smell of CK One, but the deodorant is a total fail!  Thank goodness I had a backup in the car that I was able to put on during my afternoon break.

$0.50 is the approximate value of the product.",0
I highly recommended this eye cream. I noticed a big change under my eyes. The dark circles are 70% improved. My dermatologist advised to use it and it's definitely worth the money ,1
It works ok,1
"Good razor I ordered the long handle one, but got the short with the guard still does the job so can't complain too much.",1
"I have been trying to find a good self tanner for the past 15 years or so and this is the first one I have everused that has not turned my fair skin orange!  It is the exact same color as I get from the sun!  It does go on greenish and it felt a little sticky to sleep in and looked streaky, but as soon as I showered in the morning I was left with a golden brown tan.  Be sure to use a mitt to apply it as it will stain your palms quickly.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the stickiness factor.",1
"Besides the color of this product, I have no idea why they named it ""Ocean"".  It smells like Old Spice....yuck! I have fine, thin hair and it did give me that wave look, but if you put it on wet it has that wet, gel look.  I will not be buying this product again.",0
I use to love this product and still do but switched to Helmet Head to spike my hair.,1
I have used this for the last few weeks and my nails are worse now than when I started.  I really hoped it would make a difference and strengthen my nails.....but it did not.,0
Ok first off this works amazing I freaking wear matte lipstick that doesn't come off unless u scrub it or use soap but this cloth just wipes it off freaking amazing idk how they do it but I gave 4 stars Nevis I pretty much have to wash it every day u use it wiping all that makeup on the cloth u definitely have to wash it and it's annoying,1
Can not really give a review about the product because we have not used it.  We have had sun tan lotion from Ahava in the past and it was always did a good job.,1
I'm very disappointed with the product!! Very weak hair dryer not satisfied At all I oved the original one and it's cheaper!!,0
"Lightweight, but not powerful.",0
"Yes, this product is quite expensive when compared to regular toothpastes. However, I have never felt my teeth as clean and smooth after brushing than whenever I have used Marvis Toothpaste. I have tried other premium brands sold by Amazon and so far this is my favorite. The only con is that it contains parabens, which I often try to stay away.",1
"Perfect replacement for Axe Messy Paste.

was looking high and low for one and this came pretty close.
Can be a bit hard out of the can, but be sure to rub it between palms on damp hair.

Good hold, adds texture/volume.",1
I have not ordered this bottle from Amazon but just got my nails done in the salon with Rose Bud. The picture posted is significantly different than what the color is in real life. Warning- it's a much paler pink.,0
"Seems like I'm going to go through this a whole lot faster than shaving soap.  However, the eucalyptus & menthol are very refreshing, and the foam comfortable.  I can feel it even after I rinse off and after shave. :)",1
"This really does stay on a long time,  but I find it difficult to blend.  Probably won't buy again.",1
My sister convinced me to buy this after she had been using it for a few weeks.  I have always had extremely sensitive skin and finding a face wash with as little chemicals as possible that still works was a struggle.  The only thing that bothers me about this face wash is the smell it stinks and the moisturizer almost feels like glue when I put it on my face and leaves a sticky feeling afterwards other then that so far t has worked pretty well with my skin.,1
This is great stuff.  Just a little dab will do you.  leaves you hair very silky.  I would highly recommend this product!,1
Horrible dull right out of the package. The design is really cool but the good of this product stops there. the slide out mechanism tends to fall back to flat if you grip it wrong which is very easy to do. Would not recommend and wish I could return it.,0
Did nothing for my hair at all.,0
An expensive version of Head and Shoulders/Dandruff Shampoo. This shampoo was a huge disappointment. It left my hair greasy with a smell very reminiscent of dandruff shampoos. Returning.,0
This is much better than those mascara-like covers that make me feel like I have glue in my hair.  It covers all day and I can run my fingers through my hair without getting sticky!,1
The weight of the head really enables you to get a close shave without having to apply much pressure. This in turn helps prevents annoying nicks and cuts. It really feels great in your hands. The razor is not adjustable but thats not a problem for me. The savings alone from buying this type of razor is worth the purchase.,1
"I have very long brunette hair, which has become dull and dry since moving to a location with untreated water. My cousin, who happens to be a hairdresser, tried Moroccan Oil on my hair a couple years ago, and the rest is history!
I use Moroccan Oil every time I wash my hair. This product restores moisture and shine to my extra long locks without making my hair oily. The fragrance is light and pleasant.
People can't believe my hair looks so heathy, considering the length. Good genes and Moroccan Oil! You won't regret the purchase.",1
"St. Tropez is a much better product. This one has a more orange hue, and doesn't last nearly as long...except on all the wrong places(ankles/knees/etc)",0
I usually use the filler by Toppik but this is like a hair spray and it felt funny on my head.  I will not buy again.,0
"Excellent item! It is thick enough to keep the moist around your eyes through the whole night till the morning, which for me is the most important. When you are aging, the little time you don't have moist around your eyes, you start seeing crows feet and wrinkles on your bottom eyelids. The only thing is I can't apply too much of the product because after 10 to 15 minutes, I start seeing everything cloudy. So I started applying less product and the symptom stopped.
Actually there is no need to apply a lot of the product, only a bit does what it promises.",1
Spice Berry is the only color that works for me.  The seller is great with fast delivery.  I am noticing a bit of a change in the product so the manufacturer may be revamping it's products.,1
"This stuff works great, just done overdo it. Easy does it...
Also, works best on people with thin hair but still a decent amount of hair. If you have actual bald spots, putting on them might be noticeable to others.",1
I will purchase the full size...it works just as great compare to higher end items.,1
My favorite product!,1
"I'm 41 and I've got reasonably decent skin as far as wrinkles go. I started wearing sunblock (good ones like Obagi or Skinceuticals) daily for the last 8 or 9 years. But I am incredibly fair and have a LOT of freckles. I've had IPL 3 times, which has significantly lightened the freckles and a large birthmark. So we're working from a different place here than if you've never had IPL and have lots of freckles. Skip to the end for info about dark spot correction.

I've had the Tria laser for about a week and a half. As far as pain, it's like a baby IPL sting. IPL feels to me like a lighter close up to your skin with an accompanying rubber band snap. The Tria is not as uncomfortable. It hurts more on tenderer skin under the eyes than on the forehead. But it does burn. And the burning gets worse after you're done treating. It feels like a bad sunburn for a half hour or so and then maybe is mildly, and decreasingly tender over the next 24 hours. If you are sensitive to pain, this may be too much. If you're the kind of person that doesn't blink at 40% glycolic acid on your face, no worries. I've had some minor blotchy redness that lasts 12 hours or more but isn't particularly noticeable. It's the kind of thing I notice about myself and no one else sees.

I haven't treated every day, letting my skin have a little time to heal up and flake off in between. I can't say yet that this will be a miracle cure for the 11 wrinkles between my eyes but I feel like it is doing something. I've had dysport once just between the eyes and it wore off about a month ago so I am hoping the Tria works for that. I'll follow up if I have more to say about a scar on my forehead, 11 wrinkles and the wrinkles it's actually supposed to treat. I think it will possibly help with that, but I feel it's too soon to say. But what I really bought this thing for is dark spots. Yeah, I know that's off label, but it works for that for sure.

As I said, I've had IPL. The first time, I had sooo many freckles and lots of them turned dark and flaked off. The next two times, really nothing happened as I think the setting was too low. Also, they did not get particularly close to my eyes where the goggles were and it left me with what I referred to as cheetah spots at the outside corners of my eyes. After a week and a half of 3 days on and 2 days off, those cheetah spots are fading away. Like IPL, the pigmented areas turn darker and then flake off in little flecks over the next few days. My experience has been that IPL mostly made my freckles much lighter, with a few disappearing and many still lightly visible. This seems to be doing the same thing.

I'll try to update on results, assuming I continue to use it. The thing was the same sale price at Sephora as it is currently on here ($150) and so far, it pretty much achieved the results of one IPL treatment for the cost of essentially one IPL treatment so if it does anything else, bonus.",1
great product! I use it daily. It's really good for older skin.,1
"I purchased this thinking it was the moisturizing dew without sunscreen because the picture shown doesn't say ""WITH SUNSCREEN"" like that bottle usually says and as the bottle I received actually says.  My mistake for not reading the description more carefully but I'm still disappointed.  I really don't like this product anywhere near as much as the without suncreen version - totally changes the feel of the lotion for me. Unfortunately I opened it and didn't notice until I squeezed the lotion out the first time and saw that it wasn't the kind I like.",0
"did literally NOTHING to my hair...I have dry curly hair that I straighten often, and dry conditioner usually helps me keep it looking fresh. With this product there was no difference.",0
Bought this for my wife but she says the air blows out much too hot and temp isn't adjustable.,0
"The reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because of the size. The serum is empty after about 9 days of using it in the morning and at night. The eye cream is a great size and the night moisturizer is fair.

These aren't as harsh on my sensitive skin as I thought they'd be, my only warning is they've careful with the eye cream as I accidentally rubbed some in my eye and was in pain for about 7 minutes while I was rinsing my eye.",1
"Great stuff.  A little pricey and does not work with apple phones, but I LIKE IT!",1
Great product. didn't scrutinize the description to realize I was getting such a small quantity. 50ml = 1 oz.,1
Stopped in less than a year,0
Does not work!,0
"JI's products are cruelty-free and this is the main reason I've bought them, though to be quite frank, in this case, I feel that the primer does little to nothing to make makeup last longer. I will not purchase it again.",0
The smell is such a turn off. Did the manufacturer forget to add scent? Is this a knock off branded to look like Juice Beauty? I am used to the wonderful citrus scent of Juice Beauty products.  This product smells like shoe polish and I had to wash it off my face so I could sleep. I have been using it on my feet because it does moisturize well but I cannot smell it there. I won't be buying this product on Amazon again - I'll go straight to my local beauty supply shop and test the scent first.,0
After the first time using this I felt and saw a noticeable difference. My hair was shiny and soft and so much easier to brush through and blow dry. I love it and it smells amazing. The Wellness Treatment powder didn't really do much so I don't think that is much worth the hype but the shampoo and conditioner are fantastic!,1
"It can be difficult to apply.  Dries very quickly and hard to fix.  But no more panda eyes from 6:00 AM to midnight!
Very easy to cleanse off (just with warm water) and good with sensitive eyes.",1
"Light weight, super hot. Works Fantastic.",1
Love it!,1
It doesn't flow as easy as I'd hoped.  Pretty color.  Hard to get it to go on.,1
"Helps my nails from  peeling. Love the look with just this on, no other colors, bIt that's me. You can apply color polish over this.",1
It did not really straighten my hair. I have some wave and some curl-all in the wrong places of course. I would not reccomend this unit.,0
"it has a very strong baby powder smell and it stopped spraying after a month.  Could not unclog with a pin, holding upside down, or heating up in warm water.  It held my hair alright and had a little shine. The can design is the best part. would not buy again",0
So much cheaper than using a cartridge razor.,1
it's as described a dark grey..looks nice in the light because of the light shimmer it has. two coats does the trick not a thick formula,1
"My Hands over all felt great but I noticed if I didn't reapply my Cuticles were very, very dry and hard.
I am a Ahava Fan. I have used the Ahava Foot cream for years and there is nothing better. When the Mud line came out I had to try it, but I would suggest you try the Classic as it works SOOO much better.",0
"Nice and moisturizing, but is it worth $200? I don't see it yet.",1
"Never left an Amazon review before but really unsatisfied here. NOT MATTE FINISH. Medium to high shine whether put on dry, damp, or wet hair. And I really wound't consider this a high hold...more like medium. Usually a fan of Layrite but not here. ""Bonafide"" is much more of matte finish and a better alternative.",0
Clumps Xtreme eyelash extensions. Didn't do anything for my lower real lashes. I would NOT purchase this product again!!,0
Enough sparkle and colour that a base coat isn't necessary for coverage.,1
it was way too light and didn't have good coverage.,0
It doesn't work! I have been using for months as direct and no results!,0
I really like the sunscreen product that Elta produces. I'm very surprised that this product does not live up to the same quality I expected by having used the sunscreen.  It just doesn't seem to do anything noticeable.,0
"I cannot even tell you how in love I am with this eyeliner.  I'm an eyeliner idiot and this, my friends is the real deal.  This eyeliner gets sharp enough to kill a man, yet your sweet little mother could apply it.

I am shocked beyond belief at how awesome this really is.  For starters, it's the perfect consistency right out of the bottle, not too runny, not too thick.  It gets so pointy with the tip you'd think you fanned it with a q-qtip.  It dries solid and CANNOT, I repeat, cannot BE SMUDGED.  In an instant with water it slides back off at the end of the day.  It it the perfect dark brown black.

If it were possible, I'd give a bottle to every woman alive who wears eyeliner and if I'm pretty sure if I died while doing my makeup, you'd have to pry this from my dead body lifeless body. I'm in awe and in love.

UPDATE JUL19, 2017: I just reordered to replace my near  empty bottle and kissed the new one upon delivery.

I used this EVERY weekday and occasionally on a weekend when I had the urge to climb out of my yoga mom pants, scrubby hair and let my fantastic husband take me some place nice other than Home Depot.

This eyeliner barely lost any of its magical consistency, stayed put and always came off with a little water and slight rubbing.

These people at blinc are geniuses.",1
First whiff is a little off-putting but it settles into a delightful subtle scent on my skin. Very office- friendly.,1
very hard to use.,0
"So, this does work.  My main beef is the on/off switch, which is the most freaking maddening on/off switch in the history of hair appliances. I cant believe no one else complains about this. You have to hold it down for several seconds to turn it on, but basically if you look at it funny, it turns off.  Freaking trigger switch.  I have never once used this and not had it turn off at least 2-3 times.  The. You have to go back and go over the same sections. When my hair was longer, I used the larger barrel to give me beach waves  It worked fine. Curl held for part of the day, definitely not for days. I have fine, wavy/frizzy hair.  I got a lob cut this fall and neither Wanda was really right , so I bought the curling iron attachment that is in the middle, against my better judgment.  This is really just mediocre.  My old conair curling iron that was like $20 worked just as well",0
"I bought this at the Mall of America in Bloomington.  As with their other products, it's a over priced piece of their ""system"".  This stuff is no better than Barbasol and marked up 300%.  I won't be purchasing again.",0
"I'm not sure if I received the actual product. The box was bent up in bad shape and when I opened the tube, there was no silver pull off. It was as if it was used or not the right product. I tried it on my skin and what really makes me believe it wasn't, is that it made my dry itrritated skin MORE dry and irritated. I woke up the next day with my skin so dry, red, and itchy. Now I have Neosporin on : (",0
Not the real product!  We actually bought more of this product from Macy's and found this Amazon purchase to be of different texture and scent. Container  is different as well.,0
"I've had 2 shaves with this using boar bristle brush and I'm very happy with it.  Previously tried Van der Hagen and Taylor of Old Bond Street-- Proraso is FAR superior to the VDH!  While I liked the richness of the Taylor, I could not continue to use it due to the health hazards of triethanolamine.  I'll update this review when I have a chance to try it with badger bristles.",1
I don't like this.  Too greasy and heavy.  But if you're into that kind of stuff - heavy and greasy - then this will be a treat for you!,0
"I had low expectations for this product since I don't usually believe in a quick fix, but it does actually work as it claims. Basically, it seems to burn water weight (bloat) from the stomach, so this is only a temporary fix and doesn't get rid of fat. Actually though, after seeing what my stomach looks like without the water weight, I've been feeling encouraged to try to lose the extra fat around my stomach, so I've been eating better and working out more. As a result, I've dropped a few pounds in just a couple of weeks. The only downside I've found to this product is that it's not going to last as long as I had hoped. The gel comes out sort of thick, and even with spreading it around, it still takes more product than I thought it would.",1
Very cute collection!,1
"I really love this face wash, BUT I only got to use it about 4 times before it stopped pumping out the cleanser. Couldn't remove the top to get the much remaining liquid. Definitely getting the squeeze bottle next time.",0
"Took about 10 business days to arrive so I wasn't impressed.  It smells decent, and seems to work okay.  I have used Frizz Ease products for 10+ years and they work great so I will continue to use them.",0
Smells like cotton candy,1
Very pretty Color :),1
Excellent product for people with fine hair... I've looked for products that add volume and texture for years and this is the only thing that has worked!  I definitely recommend this product and I will continue to purchase it because its unmatched in the industry!,1
"The smell is not great. I also noticed that I lost a lot of hair in the shower as I was washing off the shampoo. My hair feels squeaky clean to the point where it dries out because the shampoo has taken off all the natural oils and my hair over compensates by making more oil to the point where after a few hours, my hair is already starting to look oily.",0
Great product! Super light on skin and easy to pump out the product. I do wish there was more product in the bottle though.,1
I was very upset when open this mustela cold cream. I thing smth was wrong with transportation because when I opened water was flowing from the tube. When I shaked the tube very hard it became a creame again but I'm not sure that I can use it on my baby face,0
Cracked in less than 2 months of occasional use. Very disappointed.,0
"I just turned 50 and have been using this product for a month. I am not sure if the change in my neck that has occurred is ""real"" or an ""illusion,"" but either way there appears to be a noticeable change. I use this inconjuction with neck yoga and will continue to use this product.",1
Great product,1
"I love the way the scrub feels!! It feels silky yet it exfoliates at the same time. And afterwards, my skin feels amazing!! I highly recommend not only the scrub, but the rest of the Bliss line of products as well. The scrub goes especially well with the Lemon Sage Body Butter :)",1
"The best thing about this pomade is that you can reactivate it with water.  I can always throw some water in there and restyle it when I need to.  The only downfall is that your hands get really sticky after putting it in your hair but besides that I think this works great, especially for a guy with such thick and straight hair.",1
Love this blush color!  Perfect for daytime.,1
"Amazing fragrance,sooo clean and sexy.
price is perfect.
package really fance.
came on time.
love it",1
Great iron,1
Great product. So happy to have found this product for a reasonable product.,1
"I would NOT recommend this product....my eyes became red, irritated, puffy, and my vision blurred.",0
"I like the conditioner, but the container is difficult to open and keep water out while showering.",1
"I love this sparkly brown,  gold color.  I saw this on pinterest and just had to have!  This is a great nail polish and my manicure last 10 days with this polish.",1
I thought it would be a bit better about slicking down my edges but it's not. It also leaves white residue in my hair which I'm not happy about. It's a bit disappointing after hearing such good things about it.,0
"Don't believe the hype. As usual, I bought in,..as usual, disappointed.",0
"This product is extremely harsh and drying to the skin which I thought would a good thing for me considering that I have oily skin....WRONG!!! This product initially cleared my acne but after about a week, the extreme dryness caused my skin to produce MORE oil. It was absolutely disgusting and it took me about a month to figure out what was going on. I went back to my previous cleanser and within 3 days my face went back to normal...",0
My favorite palette :) The only one you will need.,1
Feels all tingly in a good way and smells citrusey:-),1
Glass. Came shattered into small pieces:((,0
LOVE THIS and great price!,1
Makes hair sticky,0
"Love this pallet!!!! I bought 3 of them; one for myself, mom and sister.  It was such a great deal I had to get them one too. I had been looking for a pallet that would be great to travel with; it comes with the bronzer, blush, highlight and eye shadows. I even use the bronzer as a eyeshadow and I am able to create both day time and night time looks with this pallet.",1
Been using this for about six month with very little results if any,0
It is ok. I used it all up already.  The way it is bottled leaves all of the lotion inside unable to extract or pump.,0
"I hate aluminum deodorant because of the residue it leaves on my shirts. I bought this because everything else doesn't do the job. I'd like to say I am pretty normal in the body order department however, this stuff is not worth the money spent. I had it on no longer than 2-3 hrs and it failed right around then. I applied graciously after I showered but still no luck. DO NOT SPEND the money on this. I switched to the Arm & Hammer alumni free and I haven't had any problems & its more than half the price.",0
"Light weigth and not a strong scent, but I am still trying to find a completelly fragrance free.",1
I like this item.  I am fairly young to be experiencing this issue but it never hurts to be forewarned and forearmed so they say.  It smells pleasant and I use it after every bath.  I do like to tan so it's probably for the best.,1
At 84 the wrinkles are a bit deepset.  Noticed softening of lines at about 2 weeks of use.,1
"The color on this is amazing. I like the shade.

Like others, I did have some bubbling the first time I applied. You have to do very thin coats to avoid this.

The lasting power is pretty good. I seem to chip my right pointer finger no matter what except for when I had a pro apply this. I'll change this to a five-star review if I can get that finger to last more than 2 days.",1
"$4...i paid $4 for the smallest tube i have ever seen, & i get a couple of the beauty subs, so i am very familiar with samples

yeah, i know how pricey this product is...i get it...if that's the case, then this product is not appropriate for ""sampling""- the size of the tube is not enough to ""test"" and ffs, i'm not going to purchase a cream that costs $200 per ounce, anyway...get real...people that can pay $200 for a face cream don't do the ""samples"" thing--they call somebody, and a full set of products is delivered to their door...the rich aren't like the rest of us...

this ""per sample"" program is just awful, btw

i won't be doing this again",0
I will order over and over. Color is great. Makes a great lip line and lip cover for color. I use a clear lip balm over it.,1
The best skin product!,1
Stays on longer than regular polish.,1
"The polish was thick, indicating that it was not fresh. My manicurist had a harder time working with it because of that.",0
This isn't good for african american skin i'm a lighter complexion and this makes me look dark I thought it would have more shimmer to it.  Its just lost in my make up bag now :(,0
I Love it!!! Works really well and gave me amazing curls ,1
"not the color of the bottle.  This is just clear polish.  Waste of money,",0
I am new to wet shaving but the lather seems a bit thin.  Ive seen videos where other brands are much thicker.,1
Ok. Seems to be working.  Nice fragrance and texture,1
"I have used the Personal Microderm 6 times since my purchase in July. I used the blue tips first 2 times,used the green next two times and used the red tips the last two times. I have used according to instructions. I go over my face several times.( My skin is tough and very acne scarred) Now it does make the skin feel smoother for a couple days. BUT... I have not seen any difference in my skin yet. No difference in the pores, dark spots or scars. Not yet anyway. I will continue to use this product continually for 6 months and will report back then if there is improvement or not in my skin. I have used it every 3 to 4 days. Hoping for better results. Too expensive. Tips only good for 1 maybe 2 uses.",0
I am a purple girl...love the color stays on like gel polish but without the light...I use it with the glitter as a topper gives the nails a nice look,1
I haven't notice any major difference in the appearance of my hands. It made them very soft though. I cant comment on the decolletage yet as I haven't tried it there yet. I didn't have any reaction/irritation from it as warned by others and the product. The only place that can get irritated is under my rings if it gets stuck there. I do like it for the softening effect and will wait to see if I get changes in appearance. If not I am not sure Id spend the $$ again.,1
Makes me break out.,0
"Very disappointed.  I wanted big loose curls and it barely curled my long, thick hair at all.  Curls fell out in 10 minutes - hair spray didn't help either!",0
Fantastic Product! I recommend it to those that really care about their complexion!,1
Classic shave cream gives a great shave especially when paired with their pre shave cream. Nice clean scent. Quality product,1
"Great product but offers different sizes. By mistake I selected the 2 oz size. Don't know how people can sleep at night charging so much for a small can, could have bought a large can for this amount. As stated was my mistake but will never purchase again!",0
For the amount of money this cost it should have stayed on all day and all night...it failed to do so.,0
Real nice shine lightweight silky looking hair instantly after applying a small amount to hair last all day. I'll buy it again. Seems like will last for long since you only need a small amount to do the work.,1
"For my type of hair, the hold was not very strong. However, it did say you could use it as a base for your other styling products. Still, at that price point, it's an expensive product.

Having said all that, I did like it. If your hair is not as curly as mine, you'll probably like it more.

It didn't really hold the curls, but I wet my hands with water and lightly touched the ends of my hair, which made them curl up nicely. It also made my hair feel quite soft, not hard as occurs with other styling products.

The scent is a light botanic scent, and the product feels light in your hands.

This product is best for people who have moderately curly or wavy hair.",1
I bought this mask because of the (healthy) ingredients. But the mask that arrived contains parabens and carrageenan - so the opposite.,0
"Great product. If you are worried about plastic micro beads well stop using all petroleum products, electricity, and everything else that causes pollution. Stop being a dirty hippie and get clear with this! Works as advertised.",1
Love this powder!,1
"I am a female and I ordered this to mask the slight hair thinning I am experiencing around my hairline.
Bought the sample size to test the color match before committing to the full size (I would recommend everyone doing this before giving negative reviews for color mismatch!) I have dark brown hair, almost black, and I ordered the dark brown. Near perfect match. For brunettes any lighter than what would be considered level 2 of the hair color numbering system (google it), the shade I ordered, Dark Brown would likely be too dark for you.

I only gave it four stars because:
1) the bottle had already been opened (sticker seal had been peeled off and put back on)
2) there is a bit of transfer that comes off of the areas the powder has been applied. I hope hairspray or a similar product would reduce this effect.

Otherwise it works great!",1
"Having bought two of the other Camuto fragrances in the past, I thought I would go against the negative reviews on this one and try it! WRONG CHOICE! This is not a masculine fragrance nor does it have staying power! To me it definitely has a powdery or floral scent that fades pretty quickly. If you want a truly masculine scent with some black pepper and gravitas, stick with the original Black version or else have an affinity for Johnson's Baby Powder as your signature fragrance!",0
I LOVE this texturizing spray and Im a hair fanatic!  It adds texture and volume and holds the style without being too stiff.  And it smells amazing!!!,1
"I bought this dryer when my cheap one fizzled out. I have long, thick hair and it takes me forever to dry it. I went to my local store and they were charging $89 for this bad boy - seriously? Well, I left Ricky's and went home online and was happily surprised to see it here on amazon - my trusty shopping companion.  Now, it is heavier but not significantly. The great thing is that it dries so much faster, that it doesn't even matter. I like the texture of the dryer and the long cord is a plus for me in an odd shaped NYC apartment. Overall - I'd highly reccommend!",1
Do not like this as it's very hard to get on evenly.  Tends to clump and dry quickly after it's been opened a couple times.,0
This product adds little shine and if you use too much your hairs will look dirty.  It also has a very strong perfume smell that I don't like.,0
Peels off to easily,0
Nice color... Can't wait to use it.,1
"After having tried the Cotton Bacon v2, I just wicked up my Joyetech Remix with this Koh Gen Do cotton, and I must say, this will be my new preferred cotton every time I build from now on. It's easy to cut and work with, and the flavor delivered, is outstanding, even from the first hit. Love the generous amount of cotton too, and the box it comes in. Since I'll be having so much cotton, I have no doubt it's going to last a good while, so to keep it fresh, I put it all in zip lock bags, and stored back in the original box. Go Koh Gen Do!",1
Conditioner works okay but very strong perfume scent.,0
"Life would be sad without Marvis Licorice Mint toothpaste. I wish they made it with fluoride. (I don't believe that Fluoride is evil, but many people do.)",1
"Nice light smell, easily absorbed, no oily hands afterwards.",1
Lasted two and half months being used once a day.,0
Very rough. Will take face skin off. Would work for your feet though,0
"I have used Elizabeth Arden for years and I find this to be one of the best moisture creams I have ever used.
It goes on light yet supplies the perfect amount of moisture as well as protection from harmful sun rays.",1
"A product you need to try and see how it works with your skin.  Seems to work well for my kids, but is just one part of the plan.",1
Love this product.,1
great product for a great pice,1
expensive as hell but a very nice collagen cream.,1
"I like it, don't have to use to much each time and  the lavender colors go well in my bathroom.",1
Made my lips dry like lipstick! The color wasn't sheer like it showed. Wish I hadn't purchased it now.,0
"I didn't notice an appreciable difference in my teeth.  They were not brighter and the stains are still there.  But again, maybe it is because I have years and years of stains.",0
"It cleanses and leaves the skin feeling good.

Scent is overpowering (I am scent sensitive - this is the one-star deduction).

Otherwise, it is a good product.",1
"It take long time to heat up, and long time to strait the hair.",0
"This was an expensive experiment, that turned into a failure.  I am a wine/tea/coffee drinker and chronic blueberry smoothie consumer, so my teeth could use some lightening and brightening.  I used this toothpaste exclusively for the past 6 months (with a sonicare) and exactly as directed (with a dry toothbrush) and noticed no change whatsoever.  It functions as toothpaste, in that it cleaned my teeth, but they are definitely not any whiter than when I started.",0
"This serum is okay, but just be aware that this listing is for an EXTREMELY small bottle. It is just 0.5oz, which is the size of a bottle of eyedrops. Keep that in mind when you look at this price!  I was quite shocked at how small it was when I received it.",0
Sample size,0
"Love this rose water, so refreshing especially in the summer!",1
held my curls really nicely but made the texture feel absolutely horrible! soooooo dry and gross. definitely will not be using this again. other davines stuff works a lot better for curly hair that needs moisture (so all curly hair).,0
"They changed the formula at some point since i bought this last and honestly, i'm not sure what the difference between this and the $3 tube of chapstick is.  disappointed.",0
"My husband tried this product.
He applied it without difficulty and it did not cause any irritation.
However, he did not like the smell.

I checked with him a few days later to see how it was going.
He stated that since he didn't have a habit of using a toner or doing anything other than very basic skin care, he found it impossible to add to his routine.",0
"I got almost 4 months of use out of this bottle (2x a day), but unfortunately saw no results. NO changes in the age spots or the hyperpigmentation. No evening out the color but I guess possibly a tiny improvement in brightness.  It does smell nice, is light and non greasy, and it did not break me out (which is always number one on my list of requirements).  It just did nothing else for my 40's uneven skin tone.",0
"Perfect, I look like Chia Pet after applying it !",1
Works well.  Controls shine.  Great on sensitive skin.,1
"I got this, originally, from my dermatologist after some skin cancer removal on my face. I like how it foams up when I gently spread it on. Then I just rinse off in the shower and don't have to touch or scrub face. Works good and seems to be gentle and soothing to skin. But, I don't like the price of these specialty items. I think it's too expensive. But, perhaps, you get what you pay for. If it's in your budget then go for it. If not find some alternative.",1
Great natural bronzer that is super easy to apply and provides coverage.,1
perfect gift,1
"I really like this skin care package. My face feels tighter, cleaner and looks a little more bright.",1
"Have had the curling iron 1 1/2 years and now it will not heat up unless the temperature is turned all the way up, it has only been used a few times per week. Very disappointed-it worked great in the beginning.",0
"This hair dryer was highly recommended, but it was very damaging to my highlighted hair. It's hot and fast, but tangled my hair and caused breakage. I switched to Conair Infiniti Pro and my hair returned to normal quickly. I wish I could return it.",0
Its my favorite part of my skincare routine. Mist it on morning and night,1
"I purchased a few Wen products since they were on sale. This is the only one that I actually like, that seems to make a different in my hair. I left it on wet hair for about 15 min before rinsing out. Softer, easier to style hair after use. I would recommend trying it.",1
Samples that you can get on your own. Disappointed,0
Have used Nioxin 6 for the last 1.5 years. This one feels watered down.,0
It came without the top!!,0
great product.  really works on pimples overnightt,1
"Very sticky, is not sheer, more white. I do not use it.",0
I loved this product two years ago when it was in the glass jar. They have COMPLETELY changed the formula & now use a plastic tube. The product may have the same name but it is NOT the same product as before. It is horrible. I have called the company and they are very vague & unapologetic about it.,0
Definitely for people with thin hair. Mostly just weighed down my roots and gave them a greasy feel. Would not repurchase this.,0
The only moisturizer I use because it's so gentle on my skin.,1
"I have used lots of the juice beauty products but honestly,  I'm not impressed. I don't notice any difference in my skin.",0
"The scent is very, very sweet and is more reminiscent of candy than of cranberries.  I don't mind sweet scents, but this is almost sickening.  I was really optimistic based on other reviews, but this scent just isn't for me.  I'm quite sad because I really like this product line.  I also ordered the Sweet Lemon Sage, so let's hope for at least a 50% success rate.",0
"I had heard rave reviews for this conditioner, and am always trying out new shampoos and conditioners.  This may work for some people, but not me.  My hair was dull and lifeless after using.  The upside is that it smells good.",0
Love the candle but the vendor s no good.,0
"Super light and goes on smoothly, transparently and easily. I put it on every day now as a sunblock and moisturizer. Just spent 3 days in the sun by the pool. Started out almost blue white. Now just have a healthy amount of color. Have used it for a week and not a zit in sight. Wish it cost less, but I guess you get what you pay for.",1
Not worth the money.  This product made my 12year old nieces head itch.,0
"When I squeezed it out of the tube, I thought there was no way the coverage would be very good because the consistency is kind of watery.  However, the coverage is medium-full with one layer, and if you do a second layer it is full coverage (covers most of my freckles). I would say it would be best for oily skin, because in my drier spots it looked a little cakey. The one thing I thought was strange was the smell, which was kind of chemical-smelling.  Otherwise, it looks very smooth and wears to a semi-dewy finish on normal or oily skin.",1
"I purchased a Clarisonic Classic a couple of years ago for around $150. The last time I used it the power button got stuck in the ""on"" position and wouldn't pop back out. The CSR confirmed that it was a genuine Clarisonic, but told me that after two years, there was nothing they could do. I expect a top of the line skin care product that cost $150 to last more than a couple years. I'm very disappointed in Clarisonic's lack of concern with the quality of their product and their lace of interest in their customer's experience or willingness to make the situation right. I would not recommend that you invest in a Clarisonic because of their poor customer service.",0
My go to hairspray - not sticky at all!,1
Product came leaking in the box.,0
Good product. Sometimes sticky.,1
"I have very dry, coarse curly hair and have tried every ""frizz"" product out there. Some have worked so-so, some for a day, some not at all. I can't wash my hair everyday b/c it's way too dry but I do rewet it in the AM. Just 3 drops of this oil rubbed well on palms to distribute it evenly then onto my wet hair after washing and I don't have frizz anymore, just soft shiny curls. I sometimes use it again on day 3 or 4 after wetting it (I only wash every 7-8 days because my hair is so dry) DO NOT make the mistake of using more than a couple of drops or you will look like a teenager who hasn't washed their hair in a week! Less is best with this product. I got my bottle as a 10 ml. sample and have not run out yet but feel it is well worth the price for anyone dealing with curly frizzy hair or in high humidity areas so I will buy some when this bottle runs out. At the rate I use it, it will be several more months. And it smells nice!",1
"Beware this is not the same cleanser you receive with your original Mia purchase. This solution irritated my skin to the point to where I had to stop using it completely.  I contacted the company and they said they only added more glyercin to the product, but I don't believe that.  My skin is semi sensitive, but I had NO problems with the other formula.",0
Sent it back.  Made my teeth look yellow,0
Very nice. I wear it alone or under makeup. I prefer the original to the matte. It moisturizes my face a little better. Both are very good. I highly recommend them both.,1
Perfect just by its self or over your favorite color! Makes for amazing manicures and love love love this color!,1
"Really didn't do anything and I have been using it faithfully twice a day
Maybe it would work on younger skin - I don't know",0
"I was skeptical as I was out of my favorite scrub and my day spa had a travel side of this and highly recommnend it. Ok, I'm out of mine, I will try it. It works well.  My skin is extremely smooth afterwards.  Due to the cost of my better scrub, I am working this one into my routine.",1
A good illusion to hide hair lose,1
I was hoping for a darker shade,1
"This is a unique anti-aging product. The contents in the bottle looks just like the picture. The colors are separated and don't blend when gently shaken. I am fascinated with the beautiful separation of colors. The directions say to massage 3 to 4 drops of the oil onto your face and neck. I have found that I have to add a little more than that because it absorbs pretty quickly and that amount wouldn't stretch to cover all the suggested areas. I have bee using about a third of the dropper. The oil has an almost earthy smell and reminds me of some of the Essential Oils that I use. The ingredients are listed on the bottom of the box, but the product sticker label was placed there and I haven't had any success removing it to read it. It doesn't leave my skin feeling oily which was something I was afraid of before using it. I follow up with my daily moisturizer and there has been no problems with that. I haven't noticed any fewer wrinkles, however, I have been using anti-aging skin care products for a few years now, so that doesn't surprise me. I haven't had any issues with skin sensitivity since using this oil either.",1
Great scent! I smelled a sample in a magazine and I love it!,1
"I love it so much! As a person who never really learned to style her hair growing up, and struggling with it ever since... This product changed my life! In ten minutes I can make it look like I just walked out of the salon",1
"I bought this candle after smelling it in a boutique in Atlanta. I loved the smell there but this candle smelled completely different. Upon opening the box, I could only smell a faint fragrance that resembled fruit loops cereal. The candle does not even smell when burned. I guess you get what you pay for. Next time I will just splurge and buy the one at the boutique for $60.",0
"LOVE this ""Davines Love Smoothing Conditioner""  I order the shampoo also!  I'm hooked and love it.  The shipments always arrive quickly and I don't end up ever running out.",1
"Curling iron was covered in a sticky substance, almost like the plastic container had melted onto it. I tried to clean it many different ways but could not get it off. I have the 2"" model of this product and it is the best curling iron I've ever used.  I did not return it because the shipping hassle wasn't worth it.",0
"This is a lovely blush. It gives a natural radiant flush of color. I don't prefer it on my lips or as an eyeshadow, as suggested. It has a happy citrus scent. It is small, but should last since not much color is needed. This is my first Jane Iredale product and I look forward to trying more in this line.",1
This product smells really bad that I couldn't tolerate using it 2-3 times a day as recommended,0
Most of the stuffs are only for women and those can be used by men are seriously limited.,0
Haven't seen any improvement to under eyes  after six weeks of consistent use.,0
Don't like it's BLACK and can't get my money back. HELP,0
I was introduced to this polish at a salon and I love it!  This color was just as I expected.,1
It did not smell bad but it didn't smell good either. The smell is really faint and goes away quickly. Had to spray alot just to actually smell it.,0
Does not work great. Prefer the the Style Edit spray,0
"I've been using the sunscreen milk for the face for years and have never had any issues (as long as it doesn't run into the eyes). The Melt-In absorbs into the skin much better than Neutrogena's Dry Touch and doesn't leave any chalky streaks. I was so happy with these results when I first bought it, that is until i washed my clothing - whites, in particular. Note also that I had soaked my whites for 6 hours AFTER I had spot-treated them with Shout Gel (I swear by this product). Everything that had come into contact with the Melt-In was bright yellow and yellow-green tinged. I will never buy this again. I'm glad I got a good price off Amazon, and it arrived quickly, but after the disastrous results, I wouldn't even use this product if it were free.",0
"I love this oil, the way it makes my skin feel as well as the smell its breathtaking.  The only issue I had was the shipping, the bottle was opened when I received it so some of the oil escaped :(",1
"Bit overpriced for a toner, I suggest you shop around the low end to determine the necessity before clamoring for a product like this.",0
Same name and number but the color did not match the bottle I have . the bottle sent to me has a shimmer to it. I was very disappointed!,0
Not bad if you have frizzy hair like me. Not the best but not bad either,1
"This was the biggest waste of money! Not even a year worth of use and one side of the flat iron is cold as ice! You look up their warranty and its a joke. Mail this, copy that, duplicates of this, send $15, don't straighten your hair for 6-8 weeks while we process it... Are you kidding me?!? I bought it on our Military Base, now my boyfriends deployed again, and we paid with his card... So how the heck is it realistic to have ALL this paperwork to get a replacement? Especially when so many people are having the same issues? The price you pay for this iron isn't a good investment if you are looking at longevity as a factor in choosing a product. Id recommend finding a much cheaper option on amazon and I bet it will last you years over What this one does...",0
"The first time I purchased it I had to return it because the flat iron not the cord started to spark ,so I returned the product and just got the same exact one I've had it for less then a month it works perfect but the paint has begin to rub off extremely bad and the plates are burned ,I am so over Rusk if possible just spend the extra money for a BabylissPro flat iron",0
EVERYTHING !! TERRIBLE PRODUCT. THOUGHT I WOULD TRY A NEW BRAND BUT I WILL STICK TO MY CHANEL AND REVLON.,0
This nail polish was sealed closed so tight as if it had already had paint around the bottle. It was already goopy when I opened it. Poor quality!,0
Love it.,1
Really great for shaving with a saftey razor / brush.  I'm just now purchasing my second order.  Bought the first one almost a year ago--nice you don't have to buy it often at all.,1
The clipper work really good and the battery life lasted long. Easy to used with adjustable guard to style your cut.,1
I've ordered this product many times but this last order will be my last. This latest shipment I received is not like the orders in the past. It isn't a fiber but more like charcoal powder. Looks horrible when applied.,0
I chose this rating because i have used this product many times before it makes my hair healthy and happy no dislikes at all.,1
"I wanted to be excited because felt-tip eyeliner pens are my favorite. However, this one felt like a struggle to put on. I tried to apply a simple cat eye and I felt I had to do go over it several times just for it to become opaque enough. Otherwise, it would have looked like the ""morning after."" It feels like the formula is too watery, it doesn't last long, and it's just irritating to apply.",0
I'm giving it only 4 stars because the ink on the switches rubbed off within a month of owning it. I have no idea what the settings are (except for high/hot which is my go to setting) without the manual.,1
This product is great for 2 weeks then completely loses suction. Might as well go to a salon and do a couple of treatments.,0
"Although the application process is easy with Blinc the mousse is thick and difficult to achieve the right look, very disappointing",0
love these~!,1
"Okay, if you use too much of this you're gonna hate it. GO EASY WITH THIS STUFF! And it smells best when you use the Sachajuan shampoo/conditioner combo. If you use too much it will definitely be way too strong and smell kind of old lady-ish- I did first time and I thought I was going to vomit. The best way to apply is to spray 2 or 3 times on your fingertips, then quickly run your fingers through your hair wherever its dry/static-y. Only do this once! That's all you need! If you don't overdo it the scent is light and really really lovely and won't clash with most perfumes if you decide to wear one too. Considering just this morning I thought I was going to vomit, and now I love it... well, really can't stress the less-is-more thing.",1
"I just couldn't stick with it. I'd wake up with gummy gunk around my eyes. Also, that little nub at the end of the wand I find inconvenient. It is too big and gets in the way when I use the mascara bristles to coat the lashes. I can only coat half the lashes of the eye because the nub is in the way. I have switched to Ardell Lash serum and like the application better. The price is more reasonable too and there is no gummy substance around my eyes in the morning. Will see if it works. Btw...picked up Ardell at Target. Sally's carries it too.",0
love it!,1
"Bought this for my girlfriend as a refill for her last one. This one has a very heavy perfume smell. This one is listed as ""classic"". The prior one did not smell this way at all. It had no label about odorless but it mentioned ""Aromaguard"".",1
"Too bad 37$ wasted! I had high expectations on this cream, but it gave me a really bad rash that lasted several days. I also used the serum from the same brand and I had no reaction from that.",0
"I love Perricone MD products and have used them for a long time.  What I received was not Perricone MD - not sure what it was -  I returned the products, asked for my money back and my money was refunded promptly.  Disappointed that I had this experience.",0
"Works great; nice smell, too.  Wish it wasn't so pricey.  Still, this was the cheapest place I could find it after WEEKS of checking various online and brick-and-mortar stores.  If you love Pureology, this is the place to get it.",1
Super cute and trendy but not tight enough. I love the way they look in my hair but sometimes put another pony under it to make it secure. Very cute around arm if you don't want your hair up right away but want the option.,1
Gives great volume to hair. Only issue is hair tangles very easily as a result of drying...maybe texture of hair???,1
"Amazon was the seller of this product, so I am assuming they don't sell fakes directly from their own stock...so I am surprised to find that this is very watery and runny, and doesn't last at all.  I am disappointed.  I used The Face Shop ""Ink Grafi"" liner before I bought Stila's, and it was great, long lasting, easy to apply, the right consistency...it didn't run into every tiny crease of my lids.  Stila is more like painting with watercolors, it kind of runs and spreads everywhere.  TFS is now harder to get, has to ship from Korea to buy it.  But when I compare the 2 pens side by side, Stila is also made in Korea and the products' packaging is identical except for the color of the tube...Stila's is black and TFC is grey.  Otherwise it's the same tube and brush.  So it seems with Stila you are paying more for the black colored tube and extra water, and faster shipping (right now).",0
I haven't noticed a difference in my nails except for the shine.,0
"This is a very good product.  It does what it says it does.  It holds the hair where you want it and how you want it.  Very strong hold, almost like gel.  and it washes out easily.  I am very satisfied with the product.",1
Works well and good coverage.  Use it after every wash.,1
"Follow up:
This cleanser is meh..I haven't gotten any great results since using Google it. Wasn't worth the cost.",0
"On two occasions when I used this product in the morning, co-workers told me later that day ""wow, your face looks great"" or ""your complexion looks fantastic today."" It's not often that someone comes up to you to make a positive comment about your complexion, but it happened right after I used this before going to work. I personally use this once or twice a week, and my face feels AMAZING afterwards. Leave it on for 10 minutes after you shave and wash your face, then put your face under the shower to rinse the mask off.  It has this terrific way of making my face feel clean and oil-free, smooth and soft, yet never dry. This is definitely my favorite skin care product. Yes, it is a bit expensive when compared to other mud masks, but it's completely worth it for me. One bottle typically lasts me about 2 months and I use it about once or twice a week on average. The only somewhat negative thing I can say about this is that it will stain anything it touches, so make sure you don't get it on your clothes, towels, tile etc. and that you rinse down the shower after you wash it off, or soak any fabric immediately if it accidentally gets onto it. Once this stuff has dried onto something, esp. white towels, you will not get it off. Aside from that, this mask is perfect. I've recommended this to at least a half dozen people, and I'm picking up another bottle for myself as we speak. It's truly the best mask that I personally have found on the market today.",1
"Purchased this product to combat excessive shedding. The reviews were pretty good, so I figured I'd give it a try. Used as directed, twice during week 1. My shedding increased. Will discontinue use. If anything the product is making matters worse. Complete waste of $70.",0
Product was thinner than usual and did not stay on as long.,0
Very expensive for a little bit of product. Seems to work great but I don't know if I would pay so much again. Might be good for harsh weather and sunscreen.,1
"Like this product, except for its high price.",1
"Honestly feel like it was watered down, it hardly smells like the real thing. It came in the legit package and everything so im not sure went wrong",0
"I don't think this made my skin worse, but I honestly can't say that I saw any difference from using it.",0
This product helps to minimize fine lines under my eyes. You use very little product so it lasts a long time.,1
Product expired 10/2014. Cannot use it,0
"I am 99.9% satisfied with this palette.  The colors are beautiful, very pigmented, and very blendable.  There is some fallout, but not too bad.  I use these with eyeshadow primer and they last all day.  A little goes a long way on most of the colors.  The only colors I'm disappointed with are the Deep Teal, which is more of a forest green and doesn't look like the picture once its on my skin, and the Indigo which is black with purple sparkles.  The sparkles are much too sparse.  The sad thing is that these are the 2 colors I was really really interested in.  Lorac can do better than these two shades, in my opinion.  BUT, there are still 34 other gorgeous colors.  This is definitely all the palette you need to achieve just about any look, and you'll never be sorry you bought Lorac.

On a side note, My palette was well-packed and arrived in perfect condition.  Relief!",1
"Product in picture is not what you get. Dont know if Rusk change there formula, but the bottle we just got says, (sulfate free) in big letters, not in picture. Very watered down and thin. It takes twice as much product to lather, vs the rusk sensories purify we are used too. I would no buy again. Seller needs to let people know, that this is not the same shampoo, they are used too.",0
"I love Borghese lip gloss, but this is much darker than it appears in the picture.  The lip goss itself is very nice, I just don't like the color!",0
"This is a very nice, light, but effective shower oil. It creates a light lather on your skin and the oil leaves your skin feeling hydrated and moisturized. The smell is a very light almond smell and is refreshing and pleasant without being overwhelming. I would recommend using your hands or a wash cloth to apply as opposed to a sponge or luffa, only for the purpose of using the most product possible on your skin instead of the sponge of luffa absorbing some of the product and going to waste, since it is a bit more expensive than a usual body wash. If you feel like spoiling yourself a little bit and giving your skin a little extra treat, I would recommend trying this product.",1
"It's a great product. If you just need a little lift in you hair, this is the answer. I was so happy to be introduceBigd to it's potential. Very high praise!!",1
"Even with my Brazilian Blowout, I highlight my hair so need Moroccan Oil. They said it would arrive no later than 4/8, and it arrived on exactly 4/8.",1
A decent basic blush. Works well for cool skin tones. Overall I think it lacks pigment that higher quality brands typically have higher concentrations of. The powder was firmly pressed and not as soft as expected,1
"great product for fine, limp hair",1
"Let me try to get to the point on this one.  I like this one so much because I found exactly the setting that was perfect for me.  I've been wet-shaving for about two years and go back and fourth between several open combed razors.  On some days, I even use two different razors, a more aggressive head on my sides and under my chin, less aggressive over the lip.  I found a single setting on the Futur that worked perfect for all of my face.  I now get a close and smooth shave in the shortest time.

Yes, it's heavy, the handle is smooth, and the head is large.  These are all things you'll get used too.

My two recommendations:
1)  Get your wet shaving technique down before jumping to this one.
2)  Start and the lowest setting, 0.5, and slowly work your way up until you find your sweet spot over a few days.  Doing this is what changed my view about this razor.

Happy sharing!",1
"Does not hold in humidity, rainy weather.",0
"I am happy I only got the travel size of the Oribe Crme for Style. Not recommended for blow outs or sleekness. If you're looking for a good blow out cream, get Moroccan Oil Smoothing Lotion. The cream that I purchased from the 3rd party seller appeared untampered with - so perhaps it is truly just the product itself that I was disappointed in. I am an Oribe fan - but it's just too pungent and did not deliver styling results as I expected.",0
"Works great. Have tried Balla powder as well, but I like the smell of Jack Blacks a bit better. Both are good and equally priced (+/- $1) at the time of this review.
With Jack Black's I feel that I need to use less and my nether parts don't look like 18th century nobility (powdered wigs and faces).
And after a workout or work, there is no residue left. (At least not where I can spot it casually.)",1
"Stila's famous In The Light Palette is everything you would expect! Nice pigmentation, excellent blendability and wears until you take it off. A quality product. For reference, I have dry to combination skin and am in my forties with hooded lids.",1
I like it better on others,0
"This is a horrible product. It does not 'rapid dry'. It makes the polish, for a lack of s better word, gooey. Even after 2 hrs. I wish there was a returb policy. Complete waste of money!! This will be making it's way to the trash. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. OPI typically has a very high standard in my book. They dropped it on this product.",0
Excellent gift for a men,1
"I couldn't wait to get this!  This is great if you're hair is very thin.  While the outer part is very flexible, the center opening is NOT.  I have very thick hair and couldn't even get my hair through it..  I'm VERY disappointed.  I threw it away.",0
"I took a chance and bought this since I love all the Elemis products that I use (toner, cleanser, eye serum, monoi oil) and I needed a new product for great moisture for my face. I ran out of La Therapie Pearls of Youth and could not find it here at the time. So, I tried this instead. Now I know why, when on a cruise, the Pearls of Youth were used in place of these skin bliss capsules from Elemis. The cruise used ALL ELEMIS products except for this, which they subbed La Therapie Pearls of Youth. I will NEVER order this product again and will never stray from the pearls of youth as long as I can find them! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!",0
"My hairdresser used this on my, and I immediately came home and looked it up on line. Amazon, of course, had the best price. This small size was exactly what I wanted for travel, and I got a lot of use out of it.",1
"I've used lots of glycolic pads, even stronger than these,  and yet these are the only ones that burn my skin.  I could tolerate it if they worked.",0
Not happy about my bronzer coming in all broken,0
"I'm in my late 20's and have persistent adult acne, and Glycolic acid always works really well for my face. The fact that it uses both glycolic and salicylic acid kills two birds with one stone (figure of speech, no birds were harmed in the making of this review)  I like this brand in particular because it smells kinda nice compared to the others considering the ingredients.",1
Mine came with hair on it!!,0
"Love the set, but I purchased this for the awesome toiletrie bag and the John Varvatos emblem is crooked. So much for quality control.",0
"Amazing. After the first spray, angels descended from Heaven and kept sniffing me. It was kinda awkward with my wife standing right there.

On a serious note, this smells amazing. The honey really stands out as it's drying down. My wife absolutely loves the scent.",1
"At first I thought it was okay because it smelled like baby powder, but after a while it starts to smell like men cologne. I like the other scent made by this brand so I thought I'd give it a try. Perhaps it's just this scent with my body oil that does not mix well. I can't return it so I guess I will just use it as a room freshener. I will say that the smell last a long time.",0
It's irritating my skin around & under eyes. It's very red.,0
It's okay but coconut oil does the same if not better on my dry skin.  Won't spend the money again.,0
"Love this color- not too light, not too dense looking- it's a perfect light pink!",1
"I had the Solano 3200 for over 12 years.  It was awesome!  I feel like this is not drying as well as my old one, but it could be that this is ionic and light weight ???  If definitely sounds quieter than my old one, but I just loved that old thing that served my hair for over 12 years.  :(",1
"It's always preferable when trying a new scent to wait approximately 1/2 hour to see how your body reacts.  While I'm certain that this Juicy Couture Eau de Parfum Spray will be fine on some individuals, I found it to be too cloying and sweet for my taste.  I much prefer my signature Mitsouko by Guerlain or the very difficult to find, Kingdom by Alexander McQueen.",0
"I bought this flat iron after trying a friends - and after my Chi burnt out less then a year after I bought it.  I am not very happy with it though, after several uses it definately is damaging to your hair.  And - it doesnt flat iron smooth - your hair gets crisp with lots of fly aways (even after trying different products) so....my bottom line, the Chi was 100x better for regular use with less damage.  However, since these irons are not cheap - I will be stuck with this one for a while!",0
I have sensitive skin and haven't had any issues with this powder. I use it as a one and done over my moisturizer.,1
"Not much diffrence between the deep pore cleansing brush and the normal one in my opinion.  Great vendor, great price.",1
I love Pur makeup so I though I'd try their skin care line. It was terrible for my skin.  I broke out and had dry patches after using it for a couple days... back to Clinique I go!,0
This item works great. Received in perfect condition and on time.  It is difficult to find this size curling iron that heats well enough to curl very wavy short hair. Kudos to Hot Tools for remembering there are some that maintain Natural short hair.,1
It did nothing for me. Will not buy again.,0
"Texture: waxy yet creamy, easy to apply, blends like a dream
Smell likes plastic but very light that you barely notice it
Does protect skin but leaves slightly white cast and greasiness, however the greasiness gone in 5 minutes",1
"Not sure if the shellac is okay or not, because the UV light I purchased does not try the polish so I always says sticky and then rubs off.",0
"This product has a great SPF including avobenzone for UVA protection (which is crucial for daytime skincare as lips don't ""burn"" like face and body skin does but are definitely susceptible to signs of premature ageing from unprotected sun exposure).  It also has a lovely moisturizing base.  So why spoil this otherwise exceptional formulation with the inclusion of mint, which serves no skincare benefit but DOES cause irritation, especially to chapped, dry lips?

I gave this a try as the base formula (aside from the mint) looked too good to resist.  Alas, upon applying the product to my lips they were burning and tingling and I rushed to remove the product (and promptly returned it to place of purchase).

I emailed Jack Black and requested a non-flavoured formula (or at least a nonvolatile flavouring like vanilla, chamomile or almond) but this was over a year ago and it seems they were not interested in my suggestion as the only version of this product available remains the mint formula.  What a shame as, without the mint, this product would be superb.",0
Not what I expected,0
"I'm halfway through my bottle. I use it at night and during the day, under my make-up. I have never used a moisturizer that was as light and moisturizing than this stuff. The wrinkles are smoothing out a bit, which surprised me (I bought this for the pore reduction.)

It's lightweight and absorbs easily. I don't like paying so much for a beauty product (and I only use MAC make-up,) but I will be buying more of this. My skin has never looked so healthy. It's smooth and has a healthy glow to it. Other moisturizers make me break out horribly, but not this. My skin looks amazing- highly recommend.",1
"I will NEVER be without it!  I'm going to ""stray"" and try the No Foundation Serum, but I'm not sure...I will probably come back to this.  I must admit I may use it differently than suggested, but it works perfectly for me...I put a squirt of a mattifier (I have skin that tends to be a bit oily but I don't like to use powders since I'm in my 60's) and a squirt of this foundation in my palm, quickly mix and on my face it goes.  The amount is perfect for coverage, my skin looks INCREDIBLE...moist, not oily, plump and pretty, color is perfect, I just love it.
I also use the No Blush Blush.  Love.  And the No Lipstick Lipstick. Love.  The No Mascara Mascara...Don't Love.",1
i Love it! works very well with my hair and it smells great too.,1
"I love CHI products and I loved this hairdryer, until the heating element quit working 2 months after my purchase. Plenty of air power, just no heat.",0
Product isn't reliable. Entire top comes off easily and hard to put back on.,0
"Did not smell like typical Biolage products. Left hair feeling sticky, with no noticeable ""lif"" or ""volume""",0
"The color is more gray than it appears, but excellent product.",1
"I purchased this from Sephora right about when it came to the stores and like any product, it has good and bad.

The Good: It works amazingly. I warm it up in my fingers and dab a little on my eyelid and smooth it over for a nice clean base. It makes eyeshadow stand out even more; they look more pigmented, rich, and they are easy to blend and last all day. It goes on creamy but it feels matte after you apply it, which is a nice change from other primers that feel too wet at times. A little definitely goes a long way with this primer, and it covers up any coloring or veins I have on my eyelids. I find that it also helps with under eye circles, so some mornings I just dab a little of that under my eyes instead of concealer. Just don't use too much! I've not had any bad reactions with wearing it, and I tend to have sensitive eyes with wearing contacts (and also with the spring allergies).

However...
The Bad: I will say that while being matte is awesome, sometimes my eyelids feel incredibly dry if I use it too frequently. It dries incredibly fast so you have to apply it quickly. I just take my middle finger and do a circular motion in the pot to help warm it on my fingertip and do one eye at a time. I also think it'd be helpful if it came in two more shades. I have light skin and use the Taffy, but I can still see the color of the primer on my lid. This isn't a huge issue since eyeshadow layers on top, but I have to careful not to blend it out too far. I think if they had one shade lighter and darker it'd make it a much more versatile range of primers.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this primer. I'm a fan of Stila makeup and it works very wells for me.

Edit-
I've been using this primer for much longer now and have to change my opinion on some things and my rating from 4 stars to 2. I had said before that my eyelids felt really dry afterwards. Well, this product is definitely not for continuous use. I can only use it maybe once a week! Otherwise my eyelids literally feel rough, itchy, and kind of crackly. It won't bother me after wearing it all day, but if I use it 2-3 days in a row, forget it. The price is too high for something I can only use 1-2 times a week. Plus who wants their eyelids to hurt?! I still think that the payoff is pretty great and that my shadows look great and don't crease. Just wish it wasn't so drying.",0
"fake! Fake! fake the fakest thing i ever bought, don't buy it. All this reviews are fake also. i bought the original at the store and it is stremely different from this fake version. Ive never had  problem buying in tne internet till i get to this pruduct. it is so far the worst mistake ive ever made nuying perfumes onthe internet",0
"I recently purchased this product on a recommendation from a friend.  I gave it to my husband for Christmas - we both like the scent but can never smell it even a few minutes after he has applied it.  It seems no matter how much he uses neither of us can smell it after it's on him, even on his clothes.  Even though the fragrance in the bottle is classic and subtle, it's very ineffective if you can't smell it at all.",0
It is really nice and good to use and I always order it in different sizes to take with me if going to hair dresser or to travel and it has different  shads of color and that will help to choose,1
I have bad dry mouth from Medications I take and my gums bleed easily from flossing and brushing because of this.  But when I used the pre-whitening rinse it burned my gums! It felt like I was using pure acid in my mouth!!! But the whole system seemed to work. At least I think it made a small difference if any.,0
"The anti-acne ingredient in Vichy Normaderm Beautifying lotion is 1.5% salicylic acid. I generally use a product with 2% concentration, so I didn't expect this lotion to be so drying. My skin began flaking and peeling after one use - and that's not all that unusual with a new anti-acne lotion, but even spacing out applications, after more than a week it's not any better. I'm going back to my higher concentration, but somehow gentler, regular product.",0
"Worked well, great volume, and no scalp residue! Love the nice fragrance too. Will last a long time as it works well with just a small amount!",1
This is my all time favorite hand cream. Wonderful light fragrance.,1
Not for sensitive skin. Had to throw every brush away,0
This soap smells good and unique. But it is too small.,1
"I spend a lot of money coloring my hair and don't want the color to fade away and leave the gray.  I was surprised at the amount of lather considering that this is a sulfate-free shampoo.  Obviously it didn't give me a huge head of lather, but I had expected a lot less.  And it didn't take very much product to lather up my shoulder length hair either.  There is a light scent but it didn't bother me.  I used it with my old conditioner but wanted to try it in combination with the conditioner that goes with it so I bought some of that to go with it.

My hair felt shiny and soft.  This might be my new""go to"" shampoo.  It is a little more expensive than I usually pay for my sulfate free shampoo that I buy at Target but paying a little more for a good product might save me some touch up costs for my hair.",1
"I bought this pressed powder refill thinking it would be an awesome addition to my Jane Iredale make-up regime. Who doesn't need a translucent powder for a mid day oil blot? I only have one refillable compact so I took my foundation powder out of that compact, since I only apply that at home in the morning, and immediately put in the translucent powder in it to carry with me and all seemed fine and dandy. The product itself was a bit dissapointing in that the application with a powder brush applied WAY too much product and the translucent color was very pasty and dull. But all Jane products do really have a bit of a learning curve when you are first using them. So I decided instead to try the sponge that came with it to touch up my face throughout the day. This worked better and the oil from the day was in fact blotted away, though too much product was still used! I actually kept the plactic cover on the powder and exposed only about an 8th of the product before dabbing th sponge on the product and then blotting my face. Now on to the problems that prompt the ""What the HECK?!""

I am very protective of my products, especially considering how expensive they are, and have taken very good care of this compact. But about a month after having the powder (and using it a total of 6 or 7 times and having it protected in the METAL compact!!) the powder began to separate and pieces began to flake off. Thinking it was not a big deal, I continued on in my normal fashion of carying the compact with me. Day by day, the small flakes began to turn into larger pieces that were essetnially becoming un-pressed. At one point, I attempted to repress some of the larger pieces back together and this worked for a few days. Now the entire disc of powder looks like a piece of earth in the driest of dry deserts - full of cracks and dust and completely ruined. I cannot carry the compact anymore. I cannot take the disc out fo the compact unless I want to do it over the trash can and eat the cost of the make-up because it is so shattered. I cannot use the product anymore because as a pressed powder it applied too heavy and as a shattered poweder it is a disaster!

I am going to attempt to get my money back for this pressed powder train wreck, but fear that, awesome as Amazon is, this is going to be a huge headache that will cost me money and time...neither of which can ge replaced.

So my best course of action is to caution all of you loyal Jane Iredale users to not buy this! Or if you do, be very careful with the powder!!",0
"Not only is it good for pimples and acne, but it helps soothe my bug bites.  I took off one star because the alcohol makes my skin too dry and flaky.  However, this product works.",1
"I love this curling iron! I have shoulder length hair and normally use a straightener to get my beach waves. After seeing a beauty blogger, whose opinion I have come to trust, post about this on her website, I figured why not give it a try. I like to think of myself as curling iron challenged and can never seem to get it quite right. I always end up with spider legs no matter how many tutorials I watch. For some reason, with this one I didn't. I loved that the cord twists so it wasn't getting all wrapped up around my head and I loved that it's really long. I set it at 400 degrees as some other reviewers suggested and it worked for me. I have semi thick hair and I could probably go a little higher. I used a heat protectant on it and my curls lasted all day. I got the 1 1/4"" barrel and I thought it would be too small when I saw it, but it gave me the messy relaxed beach wave I was going for. The only downside I could see about it was that it wasn't smooth when I was sliding it down my hair. The edges of the clap made it a little difficult but it didn't affect my curl in any way. It was more about the flow of curling it. I tried wrapping my hair around the barrel, but found it was a little too loose for the look I wanted. All in all, would definitely buy this again.",1
"Tried this product for more than two weeks. It doesn't hold well, actually it doesn't do anything at all. Don't see any reason to use it.  Had to use my regular styling product on top of it.",0
I like the texture and scent is very move.,1
"I was extremely happy to have the real perfume
Cacao Eau-de-toilette Spray for Women, 3.30-Fluid Ounce from this seller. The delivery was in a timely. Fashion. The packaging was the original just like previous orders I have receive from the original company. The product is what I expected and the seller is highly recommended I will be ordering from them again. Thank you.",1
I really like this product. My dermatologist suggested this brand because she uses it and it does work wonders. My face cleared up with the exception of one problematic area. I've received compliments from others on my glowing complexion. All I have to do now is find a nice moisturizer to pair with it.,1
"Rip off,its the travel size. Dont be fooled like I was.",0
"I didn't love this.  I have long, wavy-frizzy hair, and this didn't work any better for me than a dry shampoo.  Also:  the texture, eww.",0
I received this today and it came with no lid so the product sprayed/spilt inside the box. I've bought this before with no problems,0
"not comfortable, too oily. Cheap feeling as super market brand clean & clear.",0
"This stuff smells funny.  If I put it on my husband leaves the room.  Does moisturize, etc but has a peculiar odor.",0
works only for short hair and video is overrated.  I would not buy it again.  Length of hair makes it obvious,0
pretty much a colorless Polish,0
I used to love their shampoo but the new stuff is awful. Makes my scalp itch and leaves my hair lank.  I have dry hair and it does nothing for it.,0
Have used this product for about five years now & still just love it.,1
"Pretty good, not the best texture but better than most other natural brands",1
I like the ability to reach areas that I cannot reach with the NuFace standard device. A little costly.,1
Been using tanning products for years and this is by far the Best! Comes out brown so you can see where it's going! I would highly recommend it!,1
Very good but I don't know how I use it Cz  it heavy on my hand may be It take time to train my self but over all I feel it isa good quality and looks expensive,1
"I'm giving it 2 stars since when it worked it did a pretty good job. My skin felt really soft and somewhat youthful after inconsistent use. However, in the middle of a session, I was done with the right side of my face when the suction just gave out. I looked online on how to trouble and nothing. I got about 10 uses of this gadget and now it's garbage. Now I'm left is an undone face and out $90.",0
"When using, it pulls hair out close to the end. Doesn't Happen every time, but does happen often. Expected it to be smooth.",0
Don't waste your money.  Don't get what the hype is- they are nothing special and are way overpriced!!!!!,0
"I have a very sensitive face with lotions, creams, chemicals in general. I will break out like a 12 year old with most things like this.  However, I've used this now for 3 months.  It works great, and doesn't leave me looking like a teenager.  I recommend if you similar issues.",1
"Dried my skin, and I broke out. One star for the nice scent. Other than that, no other redeeming qualities. I don't recommend.",0
Product is fantastic! Rinses clean. Gentle on color treated care and smells amazing!,1
"This is not a spray. I cannot figure out why the description says to ""spray"" the powder onto your hair because that's not possible. This is a powder in a non-aerosolized bottle. The description on how to use it is very misleading as it says to thoroughly shake the product beforehand (not sure why when it's just a powder instead of a solution) and then ""spray"" it onto hair. In actuality, what you are doing is squeezing the plastic bottle so that the powder puffs out onto your hair with an expelled burst of air. This allows very little control on where the product goes and how much of it you are using. If you try to tilt the bottle to get more product with each puff, it just ends up pouring a ton of powder onto your head in one spot (horrible!). It definitely gets rid of any oil, but instead your hair is so dry and coated in powder that you would rather just shampoo it anyway! This is a horrible product. Just purchase the aerosolized Klorane dry shampoo in the can.",0
"I like every single thing about this: the clamp is strong enough but not too strong, I can adjust the heat to the exacting requirements of my stick-straight hair, and the cord is much longer than most. I had no idea how helpful that would be.",1
Been using for a couple of months. Still not sure if I love it. Smell is unique and the texture is inconsistent.,1
"I bought this here on amazon rather than my salon which I usually pay double. I've used this same product for almost 2 years and it works wonders!! HOWEVER, this bottle isn't the same bottle from the salon- and I have to mention the STRONG ALCOHOL SMELL!! I compared both scents because I still have some left over from the previous (Salon) bottle and this (Amazon) bottle are completely different.

Be careful!!! Don't want anyone to ruin there face because they bought this product somewhere else.",0
"I don't like conditioner that much,... I DO LOVE PAUL MITCHELL!!!!!! IT ROCKS....but I did like this a little but I would recommend rockaholic detangler it's great I love it but its really hard to find anymore :(........but this product was ok....i have the thinnest hair ever but it tangles alot.....i would recommend this to thick hair might be better for a thick hair girl than me with thin hair....lol.....hope this helped",0
"The tint in this lotion separated causing uneven color and actually balled up in fine particles that flaked off the face. I thought maybe it was not compatible with a vitamin C serum I also use on my face but I tried it all alone on a clean face and it was still the same result. This is the first time I've ever experienced an issue with a Jan Marini product and I have been using various kinds for 5 years. Expiration on the box is stamped 6/17.
I would like a refund but I'm beyond my Amazon date to return.",0
Love it,1
pretty smelly.  I don't like any product on my face that does not have a pleasant smell.,0
This iron is perfect and gets very hot. Perfect for curls to stay on all day!,1
dont like not a bit,0
I only received 1 attachment nozzle. Please send me other nozzles that are supposed to come with dryer.,0
"It's a great bar but I guess my skin is way too dry and this doesn't really make it much better. Also, it has a very strong perfumey smell and I am intolerant to most scents so I gave this to my mom.",1
"This stuff is ok, but not my favorite.",0
Not great for styling at all. Went ahead and bought a different straightener because this was not a smooth styling glide i was looking for.,0
"I really like this product! It has a slightly off putting smell when you first put it on, but I like how it feels once it is in. It doesn't leave my hair greasy or crunchy!",1
This toner makes your face feel fresh & clean. Doesn't burn like most toners but still works the same.,1
Smells amazing but arrived half empty with a huge crack.,0
Decent quality but pricey.,1
This mascara gives good coverage and long lashes. Can occas. be lumpy but still worth it because the lumps can be fixed. Lasts a long time. Doesn't cause eye irritation. This is by far my favorite mascara. I've ordered it several times.,1
"Such a disappointment. Not sure why this requires shaking (according to the box)--there is barely anything to shake. The color is so light, it barely shows on me and I have fair skin. My $20 would have been better spent on old school Maybelline Ultra Brow. Lesson learned.",0
"I LOVE this color!!
This is my absolute favorite color
More importantly, so does my boyfriend. I love the shine of shellac nail polish.
Red is difficult color to apply in general but as long as you go with thin layer it will cure fine, otherwise it can run to the side/cuticle before you cure it.
It won't chip off. Well worth investing in a UV light - just don't get the cheap one finger lights from the drug store.",1
"I have the issue with nothing holding my hair down unless it is the gel glue, this stuff works and is truly elastic.  It will hold all day long and not flake or start to frizz.  Great price, better than in the salon or beauty supply stores.",1
Great product!,1
"This nail polish is an amazing color with the perfect finish - not too matte but not too glossy. However, I have experienced an issue with this that I find very common among matte polishes. If you put the polish straight onto your nail, you will see every single bump and imperfection. I recommend lightly using a file around the free edge and a buffing block around major ridges. I usually do not apply a top coat to the polish because I really like the pre-existing finish BUT if you are growing your nails out long, PLEASE use a thick top coat. The finish can easily be changed with use of a matte or glossy top coat. Overall and amazing color from an amazing company! Will be buying again!",1
"Love it!! The smell is amazing, it's gentle to use everyday. It exfoliates without hurting your skin. It took me awhile to figure out harsh products are not for me! This stuff works without harsh chemicals. I had horrible skin for years and thankfully I found Mario's line of products! My routine: night- I wash my make up off with cetaphil (for normal to oily skin), cleanse with the enzyme gel, tone with the special cucumber lotion. morning- only cetaphil again, then tone with the cucumber lotion and finish with mario badescu moisturizer with SPF 17. I don't use this again in the mornings bc all I did over night was sleep so there isn't anything really to cleanse. Plus it makes this last way longer. I get a pimple here and there still, but Basically only around the time of the month, but NOTHING like in the past. My skin overall looks so healthy and is so soft! The oiliness in my skin has also gone down a lot since following this routine. Go Mario!",1
Love how this product feels on my skin and the sun protection is the best!,1
"I have deep purple shadows under my eyes, and the skin there tends to look and feel like crepe.  I also tend to wake up with a lot of puffiness.  Ive tried a lot of different eye creams and serums (both luxury brands and products from the drug store) that claim to brighten, soften, de-puff, and de-wrinkle. Not one of them has made a difference.
Im not sure what made me think this cream would be any better.  Maybe its the fact that there are a couple of actual patents on the formula, held by university researchers.  Maybe it was the unique combination of ingredients (like Niacin and licorice).
The Nia cream did a pretty good job as a moisturizer.  It didn't cause any irritation, didn't have a funky smell, and a little bit goes a very long way.  But its been a few weeks now and Ive noticed no difference between what this cream does and what my plain old inexpensive Olay eye cream does  which is moisturize and little else.  It claims to
The current Amazon price for this product is $71.00 for half an ounce.  I honestly cant recommend it.  For no more than it did for me, Ill stick to my Olay for a third of the price.",0
Love!,1
"Sadly, after many years they have changed the formulation; it is lighter/less dense and the scent has changed - I don't like it and it is overpowering and stays in my hair long after it is washed.  It is an overwhelmingly floral, sweet and almost chemical smell, like cheap perfume.  The old combination had a nice heavy consistency that washed out easily, and had a pleasant, natural and non aggressive smell.  I've tried twice but because  the formulation is thinner, i have to use more of it on my hair, and because of the new scent that i find disagreeable and cheap smelling, will no longer use this product",0
"I tried Minu shampoo and cond and loved it so I thought since this seemed more what I needed I would love it, but I find my hair seems really dry and frizzy. I do love the smell though",0
Received it broken in pieces..never had a chance to try it..it smelled good though!,0
Works great!! I love this product. Second time ordering and will order again if and when necessary.,1
"The color on the box does not match the lipstick, and after application it shows up much lighter than expected.  Not very happy with the packaging and the results of this lipstick.",0
I used it for a month and saw no results.,0
Love love love these wipes. Only 4 stars because of the price,1
"A friend who has a nice head of hair recommended this product when I complained about my hair loss. She apparently was also losing her hair due to a thyroid problem and started using  Nioxin 4 years ago with good results.
I started using their shampoo, conditioner & scalp treatment one month ago and I am already seeing results. Would definitely recommend Nioxin products.

I will update this post in 6 months.",1
"Nice to order online without going to the store!  enjoying this set.  Cleanser foams well, the mud makes tights your skin.",1
"Love this scrub. It makes your face feel wonderful, especially when used with the several of the other products in this line.",1
"This cleanser dried out my skin. the morning after i washed it, my face was broke out and peeling everywhere. I looked liked I had a rash. My skin is sensitive and already dry, but when i use this wash my face gets worse. It also tightens my face, making it feel dirty and hard. I would defiantly reconsider using this product if your skin is sensitive.",0
wife loves it,1
"It is fragrance free, rich moisturizer.
It is not great for my skin but it might be great for someone else. Overall it is quality product.",1
"The brush seems to get a bit 'globby' more quickly than the blinc Mascara, But I love this primer regardless.

 I've been in love with Blinc mascara for around a year now but have fretted somewhat over how often I find myself doing the specifically 'wrong' thing: tugging the tubes off my lashes sans adequate water. I hadn't noticed my lashes thinning (as someone women seem to suffer with the mascara), but figured that a vitamin-enriched primer might not be a bad idea.

This primer substantially amplifies the length of my lashes, and I get the bonus of feeling like I am doing something nice for my eyelashes.",1
My always go-to eyeliner! Stays on all day without smearing or turning me into panda eyes! Love this product :),1
"Got in May 2017 used 3-4 times a week for last month Dec 2017. Not used all summer due to partial thumb amputation accident June 2017, had to learn to use a curling iron again. Today it would not work. Stored proper and it was shorting out. Will contact Hot Tools to see if they have a year warranty?",0
"NEVER worked . . . straight out of the box! . . . Looks like a good product, but never got the chance to know . . .",0
This didn't work for me. Hair did not fluff up.,0
I get so many compliment on this fragrance fresh and light smell.  I love it.,1
Nice color easy to apply.,1
Good,1
"Used this product years ago, it is even better now!!!",1
"First, very pricey for the quality.

Second, it does not moisturize as advertised. The smell is great( exact same as other MO products), hence, my one star rating.  If you have very sensitive and dry skin like mine and looking for a solution, I would stay away from this one. Cheap pharmacy brands work way better.
I am currently using organic coconut oil and, trust me, it does an amazing job for a fraction of the price. Highly recommend and the smell is delicious! Plus you can cook with it as well! :)))

Verdict - NOT WORTH THE MONEY!",0
too drying for my skin.,0
"This dries crispy and crunchy.  This should be sold as hair gel, seriously.  I'm not giving up on this brand though as I haven't tried their petroleum based pomades yet.",0
"I have been searching for the perfect brush for blow drying my hair and have finally found it!  It doesnt tangle my hair, its the perfect size and the rubber handle is lightweight and comfortable to use.",1
The beard conditioner smells like plain old nivea after shave and is a decent lotion. the beard wash is run of the mill shampoo.  The beard brush is unusable. WAY too stiff and sharp of bristles to put anywhere near your face.  Maybe if you have a big burly zz top beard.,0
I must have used this incorrectly by putting too much on as my nails all broke off and completely shredded after using it once.  I love Opi so I have to assume this must work for some people but it sure didn't work well for me.,0
This product was a waste of money! I t nothing for my skin and I returned it immediately! Very disappointing!,0

But when I received the shampoo, the bottle was leaking and I did not get a full bottle.  I have ordered the same product from another company and have never had this kind of problem.  I don't know why it was not secured better.  Thank you for your attention.

"This is not as big as I thought it would be and it's really hard to use.  If it wouldn't be such a hassle for me, I'd return it.",0
Have used only 5 months and the spring is very loose. This happened to my previous curling iron as well.,0
"It came with a broken spray.
I was not able to spray i had to pour it to another container i had
but i like itself ingredients and smells good",1
I thought this did a great job on coverage and long lasting.  This color match great with my skin tone (I always like my concealer to be brighter and whiter than my skin) to help brighten my eye.  This does a good job covering up  my under eye circles and gave a good amount of coverage.  I didn't feel it was at all cakey and went on very smoothly.  I set it with their Camo Powder.,1
The heat where we hold burns the fingers  and hand,0
Excellent skin scrub. JB makes great products.,1
"Received used pre-opened product, gross!",0
Unfortunately I don't love this.  I can use my own round brush and hair dryer better.  I love the instyler much better.,0
"This is my first LAFCO candle, and unfortunately, I chose the wrong scent. I thought cilantro orange would primarily have a fresh citrus smell, but it is the cilantro smell that's dominating. Not pleasant, not a welcoming or lux aroma. At best it smells like the house was cleaned, kind of chemically-orange.  Sadly, this candle will just have to stay close to the kitty litter box, as an odor neutralizer.

Potentials Buyers: You'll be safe with any scent other than Cilantro Orange!",0
"Well i only had a month to return. Didn't realize that (my fault) however,  my curling iron quit heating up after about 3 days of use. Guess i will go back to purchasing from professional supply house.",0
Who doesn't LOVE Zoya especially when they come out with their matte collections. This Blue is simply fabulous. What else can I say. I would buy it again in an instant. You are reading a review from a gal who has over 150 bottles of Zoya nail polish. You will LOVE IT!,1
Nice fragrance but it could last longer. This mixes well with most body chemistry but don't expect an all day scent.,1
"Looks, smells and feels like Calamine lotion.  I saw this product on tv and decided to try it.  It doesn't do what it claims to do, or at least not nearly as well.  It sort of dries out blemishes.  It doesn't dry out every blemish, every time or dry them out nearly as quick as they claim.  As soon as it dries it starts flaking off your face.  You'll see little specs of dried lotion falling off your face onto your clothing.  What ends up being left is a very thin layer of the product.  It also doesn't wash off easily.  I use a Clarisonic brush, and it takes multiple passes over the lotion to get it all off.  Don't waste your money.  Spend it on vitamin c and retinol instead.",0
"I have used this product for 2 years and previously ordered from this vendor in the past. My last order with them was perfect. However, this time around, I suspect the product was not authentic as it did not smell the same nor did it look the same. Additionally, the bottle was only three quarters of the way full. I don't like leaving bad reviews but I fell it's important to warn people what to expect.",0
Does not get hot enough to curl my hair.  I use curling iron to supplement.  Clips are horrible and so bought others at Sally's.,0
No fragrance!!!~Maybe it was stored too long and the fragrance evaporated?,0
"Works awesome. Holds all day, does not smell the best",1

"For the last handful of years, I've been custom-making my foundation.  I've been mixing a number of them so that I could have a true match to my very fair, eczema and rosacea-prone, combination complexion (a lovely package to have) .  However, what goes into the mix is not necessarily cruelty-free, hence I've kept my research going on the side.

JI's are certified by Leaping Bunny to be cruelty-free which is one of my priorities.  I decided to give this BB 1 cream a chance and here's them gist of my experience:

PROS:
It's cruelty-free
The BB 1 shade is the closest match to my natural skin tone with  the exception of my custom-made mixes
It does a great job at covering under-eye lines and puffiness
It lasts longer than regular foundations
It has great texture, not super creamy, perfect for covering spots.

Price
It does cake a bit",1
Nice fragrance silky feel when applying.  I am puzzled by packaging.  You cannot see how much is in there or what is left.  Will see how it goes before I reorder.  Still miss Energia product.,1

"Not long wear but nice color, I wanted something I didn't have to re-aply all day kinda dissapointing and I won't buy again.",0
Great Product!,1
"I have very sensitive skin. I've been using this for about 1 year on and off. The sunscreen doesn't give off a white cast like most others which is nice, however, it does leave my skin looking very greasy. I have also had a handful of incidents where my face started burning like crazy after I started to sweat and I had to immediately go wash my face and pat it with cold cloths to relieve the burning sensation. The smell is not good either. I work with children and they've asked me ""what that smell is"" every time I wear it on my body and face.",0
And who wants to smell like that?,0
"I usually love stilla products, but I do not like this. I find it goes on a shade of dark blue rather than black, and it does not stay in place. I use an eyeliner brush to apply it, as the tip is a bit too thick to apply directly to my eye, but even with this even if I put on a TON of it, it still goes on a deep blue shade, and does not seem to stay in place. Definitely would not recommend this.",0
"I had to return this hair dryer because it is quite heavy to hold as long as I need to dry my thick hair.  I bought it because I read that a ceramic blow dryer is good to smooth frizzy hair.  This dryer did not do the trick.  Also, the switches to change the heat settings and the air flow are impossible to change with one finger as with other dryers that I have had.  There is no tab on the switch, only an indentation that you must apply pressure with both fingers in order to move up or down.  That meant that I had to keep interrupting my blowing drying.",0
"I, too, used Pernox (5 stars!) for decades, from my teen years until its discontinuation. Face it, nothing will ever work like Pernox for cleaning, exfoliating, controlling acne, and conferring that youthful glow. However, after reading several reviews about Yu-Be Foaming Skin Polish, I decided to give it a try. It is definitely more effective than the apricot scrub I'd used once and tossed out. For maximum effect, the closest you can get to Pernox, use the Yu-Be on a Buf-Puf facial sponge (gentle). With the aid of the Buf-Puf, which has exfoliating qualities of its own, you can really scrub your skin smooth. Yu-Be has an odd scent, like mushrooms growing in a dark forest, but the scent washes off along with the product. Unless someone manages to bring Pernox back, Yu-Be + Buf-Puf (gentle) is probably the best you can do.",1
"My daughter would dry out if we used regular generic products, however, this line is amazing. Her skin is so soft and smells just like a baby should! I love love this product*",1
"Original, excellent",1
I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely adores it! It came with the free travel compact and it's great.,1
Not in a tube,0
I don't even think this is a real CHI product anymore. Should have realized when the bottle came looking dirty and damaged. It leaves my hair feeling like I showered with chlorine.,0
This kit does not dry skin but gets it clean,1
This came damaged and I want a replacement with out me haveing to pay to send it back.,0
"It does absolutely nothing for my hair. My hair is still frizzy as ever; as a matter of fact, I think it's been looking worse and frizzier than before I started using this product. I have alot of very thick, wavy/curly hair and it sucks out my wave and/or curl and leaves it a bushy frizzy mess. Also, cannot use on dry hair, no matter how little I use or what other people say; it leaves it waxy and makes it ratty like it wants to start dreading. What a waste of money!! I do not recommend.",0
"This is a good hair-dryer, but it is pretty heavy (I just consider it a good arm workout haha). It doesn't do anything miraculous. I'm not saying it's not a good hair-dryer, it definitely is, but it doesn't do anything my old $25 Conair hair-dryer doesn't do. More money doesn't always mean better product. Just something to think about.",1
"I tried several products to cover my grey between hair colorings. This was a bit dryer than others and also sticky - similar to a light hair spray on my hair where you can't put a brush through it without a bit of tug, resistance and breakage (for weaker scalps). Also, I prefer the spray (instead of a focused point like others) which helps blend, so I don't have to make a mess of my fingers by blending it into my hair.  I have almost dark brown hair, so this color blended well. The color says light brown, but it actually comes out darker than most would think as light brown. I tried the dark brown and it was too dark - almost black.",1
"I would never buy one of these again online.  This item arrived and it took a few uses to understand why the thing seemed to damage my hair.  The two sides of the hot pad area are not parallel, the end of the heated area touches before the other 3/4 of it.  In order to flat iron you have to press hard enough so the whole area is in contact with your hair but ... the area that touches first is then too pinched and it pulls your hair.  I ended up putting it in a vice with a piece of wood at the end and left it there for a period of time and both sides ended up parallel.  I used it and couldn't believe how nice it ran through my hair but ... next time I used it, it went back to the original condition and is now once again .. useless..  If not for this problem it would be a great little iron.",0
"I was able to use it once. While I did like the cream the pump broke so all my money is down the drain. Can't extract the remaining product. It seems to be only partially filled in the bottle anyway. If anyone can give me tips on how to bust this thing open I would appreciate it. Should be zero stars. Very disappointing. I was 2 days past the return window. I am busy like most people.

I edited one star to four because after fiddling a lot (not sure what worked I tried so many things) I was able to get the pump to work again. I like the cream it makes my skin feel very soft. Will edit later for a more accurate prolonged use.",1
I use this when I want tight curls. It takes a while to do... I usually take little strands and wrap it around the indents (not the bulb) ... Classy look!,1
I loved the color.  But this entire color line by Essie chips VERY FAST.  Even with a great top coat.  Fortunately it dries fast.  But I found myself having to redo my nails almost every day with all of the colors that I bought from this line.  Making me shy away from Essie for a while...,0
"repeat buy, my favorite leave in conditioner and if I'm away and don't have it, I miss it",1
"It scarred my skin where my ance was. I have used other 10 percent benzoyl peroxide products and none of them were as harsh as this one, I do not recommend this product.",0
"this is gentle and smells fresh but it isn't overpowering which is important for me since I am sensitive to smells.  I use this on an exfoliating pad at night instead of buying expensive drug store face wipes.  Ill use it in the am to for a refresher when its too cold to wash my face or i feel like skipping a shower!  The only reason I didn't give it five Stars is that i need to use a different cleanser for my mascara, this stuff just takes a million wipes to get all the mascara off",1
"Really nice shampoo, lathers and cleans great and smells terrific. BUT...I cannot justify paying 28 dollars for a tiny bottle. Nothing is that good, sorry! If price is no object, then I would give it more stars.",0
Been struggling with my teenage daughter and her acne.  Her Dr. Recommended this product and wow what a difference.  Needless to say she no longer suffersi from acne.,1
Love the scent of this hand cream - love lemon!,1
Gives your skin instant dewiness. I think the result is temporary though.,1
"Works great for my curly/thin hair, smells like I just stepped it of the salon every time.",1
FAKE. This product is a very thick white consistency. This is thin and yellow tinged. It isn't the actual product. Also you can buy a bottle for 50 cents less on their actual website.,0
Great Product.. Great Shipping Thanks...,1
love the price n the product fast shipping thanks,1
I absolutely LOVE Vita Liberata's tanning mousse...I've tried both and they are amazing so I expected similar results with this product. Sadly I have used it several times now and my face isn't even a hint of a shade darker. Very disappointing.,0
"This conditioner works great for color balancing. If I use it twice a week, my highlights stay nice and bright. The only downside is the smell.",1
"one of my favorite dry shampoos, if I didn't fall in love with monat this would be my go to product!",1
"This eyeliner came dry, doesn't give a smooth precise line. I've always bought pen eyeliner from Japan and Hong Kong, because they're the best. This didn't even come close to Dolly Wink or KissMe Heroine pen liner.",0
"My daughter had no reaction because she's older and her eczema isn't an open wound, but after reading the ingredients list which is on the mustela website and not the packaging I wouldn't have purchased it. The product is mostly preservatives and alcohols plus one distillated oil. I don't doubt the one star reviews regarding burning on open wounds. Skip this and try metaderm organic for eczema or psoriasis.  I wouldn't put this on an aggravated rash if they paid me.",0
"I know that RevitaLash asked us to wait a few weeks before posting a review of this item, but I noticed it start working almost instantly! My mascara has never gone on better in my life. I had no idea how much better this would make my lashes. Before, mascara went on, but it felt rough and my lashes clumped together. I thought it was the mascara's fault (well, it probably still is), but after using this conditioner, my lashes spread equally apart and mascara just glides on. I am so very impressed with this product I will most likely be purchasing it when my current supply runs out. Total game changer!",1
"Love this brand, good price.",1
"This one (Color= Mod About You) is not genuine OPI. The bottle is different than my others and when I went to color match it, it was NOT the same color. My 4yo asked me why I put 2 colors on my nails when he saw the one I test painted.
Not sure how it will hold up bit I am not happy to receive a false OPI",0
awesome !,1
Made no difference,0
"Glad I only bought the 2 oz size because it is too expensive.
2oz for $9.  is too much for a product that really isn't that
special.  Yes, the fragrance is nice.
I found it a bit drying and the ingredients are like so many other
face cleansers.  Maybe I paid for the name.",0
Helps with my puffy  eyes,1
I thought this was primer for makeup. Dummy me.,0
"I love this product the day I use it, but I must wash my hair the very next day. For that reason, I'm not a fan...sorry.",0
"I bought this to replace a blow dryer that literally was burning chunks of my hair out. It blows hard and drys my hair fast. So far, so good!",1
Great stuff,1
"These have such a high rating, but I asked a friend in the industry and he's never even heard of them.  The product is greasy, they give you a travel pack sized one for over 40 dollars.",0
Soooo not the Chi I know,0
"I am really disappointed withqoth this facial cleanser. It is so different with my last one was used. It facial cleanser is so bad, the smell like detergent and the liquid color is yellow. DON'T BUY IT",0
"ok, not sure if it works.  But smells good.",1
This stuff is great.  A little bit on my badger hair brush and a whole lotta creamy foam!  What a close shave.,1
Pricey but works.,1
"This man-wash makes a great gift, but probably doesn't make a whole lot of practical sense otherwise unless you have the money to spend on premium body wash.  I love it for the ingredients and the sort of whiskey-maple, musky smell.  It cleans head to toe -- hair and all (and I have a big bushy head of hair so am picky about shampoos) with great results.  The biggest downside is that it doesn't really lather up great, so I end up using quite a bit each shower session.  I would imagine that any whiskey-drinking, cigar-smoking manly man would love this wash as a gift.

The presentation of this product seems geared toward your average whisky-lover.  It looks like a bottle of bourbon and sort of reminds me of a good bourbon with the way it smells.  It's a sweet, musky smell that just oozes masculinity.  It's kind of what I imagine the Dos Equis 'Most Interesting Man in the World' to smell like.

The ingredient list is all natural, nourishing food based products like quinoa.  The texture is syrupy like that of thick maple.  It all feels really good and leaves my hair and body both clean an moisturized.  I sometimes get skin reactions like acne breakouts from certain soaps, but this product has just positive benefits for my skin it seems.

The biggest downside to this product is that it doesn't lather up particularly well, so I end up using quite a bit each shower session.  Coupled with the relatively high cost, it's difficult to justify as my personal body wash year round.  It's more of a luxury item.  And that makes it a fantastic gift.  I plan on getting one for my father and probably brother.  Don't tell.

Overall I really love this stuff and would recommend.",1
"I don't believe this is the ""REAL"" Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner. It leaves my hair extremely dry, like I'm applying a very cheap product. I would return had I not waited so long.",0
Product was damaged when I received it. The top was completely snapped off of the bottle and the product leaked out all over.,0
My husband has a spmewhat heavy beard and he likes this shave gel. He found IT gentle and soothing.  It ceratet an  adequate amount of fram and wholesome applied to the Facebook moisturized without leaving a greasy residue.,1
"I'm really sorry to leave a negative review for this product as it started out so promising. The first two weeks of use soothed my dry under eye area but within that second week my eyes started reacting negatively to the balm. It took me several days to realize that the balm was triggering the severe tearing and itching under my eyes and on my eyelids. After I stopped using the balm, it took days for the reaction to clear up. I did research on the product ingredients and discovered that some people may experience an allergic reaction to calendula which is obviously what happened to me. If you are sure you don't have a ragweed allergy (which is similar to calendula) then you most probably would be able to use this product.",0
I bought this for my sister for her birthday. It is a knockoff!! The scent only lasts for an hour. Wish she would of told me sooner so I couldve returned it.,0
"I have dry, very tight, curly African American hair. Normally conditioners will soften my hair and relax my curl pattern. I heard A LOT of amazing things about the nourishing and moisturizing properties of WEN and I've been excited to try it for sometime. I was put off by the price. $36 is the most I've ever paid for any hair care product. In any case this cleanser is not for my hair. The tingle felt good in the shower and my hair seem to be moisturized but the results don't last after the product is washed out. I did a leave in with the cleanser on wet hair, wrapped up for over an hour and I still didn't get any type of results. I practically used the entire bottle in just a week's time thinking I needed more for my hair type. I will not spend money on WEN again. The whole time I kept asking myself, ""WEN is this going to be worth it!?"" Don't steal my joke.",0
NOT IMPRESSED. The undertone is yellow. YUCK.,0
"I purchased this to try Julep products, and also because every time I have my nails shellac'ed they're damaged. No matter how I have the shellac removed it always makes my nails peel and break afterwards. I had my nails done with shellac for my wedding, and afterwards hoped this polish would help them get back to good health faster. The polish is a very milky pink-ish color. One coat kind of looks like your nails are cloudy. Two coats helps give the impression that there's actually a polish on your nails and they aren't just a weird color. It chips really quickly, and the chips aren't super noticeable as it's so close to my natural nail color anyway. I didn't notice any significant improvement from using this polish. Other than being a polish you can keep on your nails in between paint to help mask any peeling or rough damaged spots, I don't really like to use it.",0
I love the color and that the on/off switch is on the side and will not break off this time! These products are expensive and when you buy one that only lasts a year you become discouraged in the product. I purchased this one at a much more reasonable price and so far I love it!,1
Who knew this would work so well. Will have to order more.,1
"I've been using ""Vichy LiftActive Retinol HA Eyes"" for the past several days and though my fine facial lines have not disappeared (yeah, dream on), they do seem to be somewhat fainter.  I have used it on the crow's feet (actually, I don't have much of a problem with them yet), but also on some fine lines in the corners of my mouth.  Those seem to have gotten fainter.  I don't think this is a permanent thing, and would have to continue using this product or one like it to keep them at bay, but for review purposes I think it works at least a little bit.

You don't get much  - only half of one fluid oz for $42.00 (cost as of this review).  The delivery system is different but it seems to work o.k. if you don't press it down too hard.  I did that once and lost my wrinkle cream to the sink.  It goes on smoothly and seems to last for several hours as far as the moisturizing properties are concerned.  And it has little to no smell which is a very good thing.  I hate smelling perfumed lotions all day that I have applied to my face because they make me nauseous after a while.  The Vichy has no detectable scent.",1
Creates the perfect soft natural looking waves that are so in style now. I wish I had bought it years ago.,1
"Love the smell , but i found it to be a bit too oily for my hair.  It caused my hairline in the back to break out and itch......so i finished the bottle by just applying it to the ends of my hair and not the roots and rinsing well.  I did not feel it out did any of my regularly priced , locally bought products.  Quite pricey.",0
I normally use Paul Mitchell shampoo for my red hair but ran out. I decided to give this a try since I heard good things about it. That was a mistake. One use and it took the red right out of my hair and left it copper.,0
What is wrong with this conditioner? It smells like a mix of plastic and animal pee! Am I the only one with this issue?! Yuck!,0
"Ordered light blonde received what appeared to be light green, tried it twice and both times it looked terrible. I wasted my money but at least I ws smart enough to purchase the smallest trial size for less than $ 7.",0
"I was pleasantly surprised at the results.  It look a little longer than expected.  I didn't see results for about four weeks but once they started, it was amazing.",1
Quality of the polish is fine however the color is much darker than the image suggest and does not really look green at all.,0
"These are wonderful pads for the skin. I received them quickly after order.

BG Allen",1
"This product smells really good in my opinion, and it does exactly what it says. I would consider buying it again.",1
Wonderful product at a much better price than other sites!,1
"This is a good purchase, I have not had any issues with the scent being diluted or short-lived. It is of the same quality as the cologne I purchased from a department store, only much cheaper!",1
"I love trying new bath and body products.  Especially ones like this.  This Rituals The Ritual of Ayurveda Foaming Shower Gel, first of all it should have a cap on it.  Mine didn't.  The product is supposed to come out as a gel, and once added to water turn into a foam.  Mine actually came out as a foam, and it foams and foams!

This is supposed to smell like Indian Rose, whatever that is it is not related to the rose flower, and Sweet Almond Oil.  I didn't think it smells like that either.

I am trying to think of what it does smell like. For some reason I want to say sandalwood or musk, maybe a little beachy.  In any case to me it has a nice, warm, pleasant scent.  The scent, you can definitely smell it on your skin, but it's not overpowering, but I found myself wanting to smell it, so that's good.  I'd love to try more of this companies products.  This scent would make a nice hand soap or bar soap, candles, etc.  The firery red of the canister is different too.",1
"The text does not match the image.  The text says ""Vintage Cologne"" but then ""2.5 oz EDT Spray"" and the image is of ""Artisan Eau de Toilette"".  I have searched and searched but John Varvatos does NOT have Cologne fragrances just Eau de Toilette.",0
"This shampoo is great for my color-treated hair subjected to very hard water. I know with color-treated hair they say to avoid washing it too often, but I think using this shampoo is gentle enough that it's OK. Also it smells great. Really great even.

I do end up needing to use more of it than a normal shampoo, and I still need to use a clarifying shampoo maybe once a week to get that clean-clean feeling.",1
"Didn't like this scent at all. Way to strong and reminds me of ""old roses"" or that fake rose smell. The scent grandmothers would wear waaaaaay back in the day. It also gave me a headache as I've tried to wear it a few times. It's just to strong. The rosewater scent is much better and more natural. As for the formula...crabtree & evelyn never disappoint with their ultra moisturizing hand cream. It's one of the only ones that keeps my hand moisturized longer than any others I've tried. Not to mention that my hands stay extremely soft. Will not repurchase.",0
The best shea butter I've ever tried. It works wonders on chapped lips and dry skin!,1
I forgot to attach picture ...I received Nioxin System 2 and no return label.,0
"I really like this color.  I am very pale and it still looks good on me.  It is the exact same color as the bottle looks to me, and it went on perfectly. It is thick, but I like that. I can thin it down a lot easier than trying to put on 4 layers to get the thickness I want. It is really pretty.",1
"I have fine hair and had hoped that if I used just a real, tiny amount it would be okay, but not so at all.  No amount of this is small enough for fine hair, period.  I gave my bottle to a girl at the office who has a full head of thick medium length hair, and she really likes it, said even her husband likes it on his super long beard.  So it's a good product, obviously, just have to have the hair for it, which I do not.  Thanks!",0
Love this product,1
Most regrettable purchase ever. Most of the samples were just smears in a tiny paper packet and some were missing. Packaginging was there but no product.,0
It stopped work for no reason.,0
"I got this in June and it is already DEAD!  It lasted 3 months.  One morning it got REALLY hot and burnt some of my hair.  I looked at the twist dial and it was set at what it had always been set at.  I turned it down by half and waited for it to cool a little bit. Next morning, it would not heat up at all.",0
Would be a great sunscreen except the tint rubs off onto fabric,0
"The Proraso red produced the best shave I've had with Proraso products.  I've tried white and green, and for my sensitive face, this one is simply the best.  I love the smell, the lather is easy, and my skin feels great.  I may have previously reviewed green or white, I can't remember, but after having used this for a few weeks I am convinced that this is the best of the three that I've tried.  As a man, you simply cannot go wrong with sandalwood.",1
If you have sensitive skin you must beware of this product. This spray gave me a terrible irritation all over my scalp. Even after several washes it was so bumpy and itchy that I had to see a dermatologist who prescribed me with Flucinonide solution to make the irritation go away. I've never had this type of reaction to a hair product before.,0
"This is a great shampoo, leaves your hair feeling clean and blonde.",1
"All wearable scents come down to only two standards for quality.
The scent is ON POINT! And the Overall quality of duration is SUBPAR. Unless this is a knock off, but probably more likely cause its in body spray form rather cologne.",0
A friend recommended this to me and I am really happy with this product.  Isn't greasy for my skin and feels good on.,1
"I really like this product,  it smells divine!  Because of the price, I use it only on special occasions.",1
"Oil feels low-grade, and it gave me acne until I stopped using it.
I recommend looking elsewhere for higher quality face oils.",0
I was so excited to see Essie nail polish on amazon.... I thought I was ordering this barely purplish more reddish wine color as seen in the product pictures but it arrived as an undesired purple. I can't return it so I wasted $9 on this color that I will never wear. I want my money back. I always rave about Essie nail polish but this was a disappointment just because the photos aren't accurate. I guess I have to buy it in store from now on to be sure of the color.,0
"I am not sure if I got an old item or if this is the real deal but when I opened this, the brush was stiffed and it was hard to work on the color. I have bought several CND Shellac from other sellers before and none of it was like this. I should have checked the item as soon as I received ot bit being inside the box, i thought there was not going to be a problem. I am planning to contact seller if this is still eligible for exchange.",0
"One of my biggest concerns that I will never know the answer is, if this product is legitimate and if it comes from the original manufacture. I called the original manufacture and they said they don't allow third-party sellers and that they can't guarantee legitimacy of this product . ",0
I use to love their products until they changed and started causing sores on the scalp and hair loss.,0
"Scent doesn't hold at all, cannot be real Azzaro.",0
"Its cute for kids...but didn't expect it to break by a toddler so easily as its emphasized on ""flexible"".",0
Best hair gel I have had.  It keeps form throughout the day and doesn't flake.  Never had a bad JB product.,1
"It took over a week to get my product. When I finally received it in the mail, it was damaged. The box it came in was not damaged at all. So, that means someone in the packaging department of this manufacturer was not paying attention. I wanted the item replaced, but it seems like items can not be replaced, either with Amazon or this particular company. BOO-HOO!!!",0
"A pretty Quiet and light weight dryer for a great price.  Low isn't very powerful but It still drys the hair just fine and is very quiet.

I've been using this dryer at my salon since I received it in 2014, I like it but I wish were quieter and it had a medium heat setting, it has cool high, high and low HOT with a cool button.",1
"My girlfriend has been bugging me to get this hot tools curling iron for her. I bought the wrong kind the first time
""DOH!"" so this time I got the right one. She tells me it works great and doesn't burn her hair like some other ones. Heats up fast and all those good things. Can't complain! One thing I do recommend is buying direct from AMAZON. I accidentally bought from a third party and there some hints of counterfeiting. Product works good so I can't complain, but better safe than sorry.",1
"This product was extremely effective, I love how it gives you a natural look.",1
Smells really good and works well!,1
"The price is a bit steep, but definitely worth it. Its matte, so it looks very natural in my hair, but holds really well. I have really thick hair too, no problems with hold. Ill never use anything else in my hair.",1
Makes you skin very dry and itchy.  I wonder why they need to make men's products that are so overly masculine.  Get the shower oil.,0
"This is a fantastic, rich and smooth product....consistency somewhere between a serum and a cream.  Goes on easily.  A little goes a long way.  I dab it all over then smooth in.  Expensive yet a quality product.  I can't say I've seen a huge difference either way, although I don't use it every day and rotate between a few products. For the cost, a fairly small container and the glass of the jar itself is thick....takes up much of what you think is the container space for the product when you take off the lid....that's my only complaint.",1
Very fine beads.  works well.  Has  a nice scent...,1
"I love Jan Marini products. But, I now have a bottle that the pump does not dispense the product. How can I get this exchanged?",0
This makes a mess.  And be carefull if u buy the applicator that you are getting the correct size Toppik...mine was mini so now I have an applicator I can't use because I won't be buying this again,0
Works well if not used in excess.  Particles may ball up and show in certain conditions. Otherwise a welcome alternative.,1
Hate this product! Does nothing to your hair.,0
For fine hair this is a great conditioner,1
"After you use it to tie your hair for a while, the hair tie gets worn out and ends up not looking good and doesn't look how it looked originally (I know that it is normal for hair ties to lose their elasticity and strength, but this one occurs more faster than normal hair ties you buy at a cheaper price). It ends up looking like a ugly hair tie to be honest.",0
1 star because I couldn't give 0,0
"I was open to trying the smell, having read the reviews, but this stuff smells HORRIBLE.",0
"Strictly personal preference, I opened it and couldn't return.  Money wasted, hate that fragrant like walking in a nursing home.",0
"Love the product, even though it is rather pricey!",1
"I bought based on a friend recommendation, and I've been using the product daily for 6 weeks and I see no difference at all.",0
Not a miracle product that I was hoping for.  I hate cystic acne but due to genetics I get it often. Seems to work well.  I was going through rough patch with my skin and seemed to get rid of some cystic acne in couple of days.  I wasn't given anything for this review.  I really recommend using the mario badescu drying lotion with the buffering lotion.  I'm in my 30's and have sensitive and erratic skin. Usually get pimples around the nose and cheek area.  I've dried eating healthier and drinking more water.  No matter what though I usually get some cystic acne and it's big and ugly and hurts.  I'll put the buffering lotion and drying lotion on at night. I've also started using tea tree oil with my neutrogena sensitive skin wash at least once a day and that's been helping.,1
My new favorite - not too strong or perfumey.,1
"Felt sticky, made my hair tangle and really didn't hold my curl either.",0
"Because if I'd have paid full price elsewhere I'd be even more disappointed.  Curls don't hold, had the rollers in until cooled sprayed the curls they still fell flat.  Also for hair as long as mine, I probably need twice as many rollers, but even setting only half my hair at a time AND using a heat setting spray...flat in 10 min.",0
"I personally would not recommend to anyone. Came with three samples of perfumes (that I could have gotten for free at Macys). A lot of sample products with no instructions on how to use or what they even are. I was quite frankly disappointed with the Luxury Beauty Box, no make up of any sorts. I will not be purchasing again. It would be nice if Amazon included a list of products including their info, what they are and how to use them. This would have increased rating from me to a four star.",0
"I liked this cream--it does help a bit with crow's feet and fine lines. However, I did experience a little tingle/some stinging when I first started using it. And it was a little, well, thin (watery?) than I usually like. That's why I took off one star. It does work, though, but I caution you not to push the pump all the day down or you will have way too much cream to apply. I keep doing this by accident and end up using the excess on other parts of my face and even on the backs of my hands. ha, ha.

I like that it does not contain harsh or harmful chemicals and it does not have a strong, perfumey smell, which I also appreciate as I have allergies. For those looking for a more ""natural"" product that really works, I think this is an excellent option.",1
"I like this product alot. I agree with one of the other reviews written. I gives a great shine for the first day, after that it makes your hair a little greasy. As, long as you apply it wet, then dry & flat iron, you can't go wrong. It looks great every time.",1
"This hair dressing was recommended by my stylist, who sold it in her beauty shop at double the price I got it for on Amazon. The product leaves your hair soft and has a nice coconut smell. Be careful about how much you use. You only need a very small amount and massage in ends of hair first and work up, as it can leave your hair looking very oily if you don't distribute evenly and get too much on top.",1
"Love this mascara.
I have contacts and a lot of mascara bother my eyes. This does not at all.
I feel like you can't build the color in the same way as you can with other mascara, but oh well.
This doesn't smudge and lasts as long as you want. Plus, it's fun to remove!",1
Nice job and easy to apply,1
I loved this product! The curls were perfect with my long hair! If you have long hair this curl size is perfect and I highly recommend this curl size and product!,1
"After several weeks of use (about twice a week) I found this dry shampoo unimpressive. It's not horrible, but it's not great, especially considering the price. It did leave very, very subtle pinkish streaks to my hair which is blonde/white and not processed, which was, well, a little different. At least for my hair type, this product didn't do the trick, I prefer the Klorane dry shampoo much more, but if you're still searching for a dry shampoo for you, this one is worth a try.",0
Not authentic product - took forever to ship,0
"I Love this product,",1
"I have two life palettes (work and love life). I've been fairly happy with them. The color payoff is fair. It helps to have a good eye primer, and fallout is minimal. What I really like is the blush. I get a decent color payoff. I've used other blushes from BH cosmetics and the color payoff is greater but I have to use a very light hand to avoid looking like a clown. So the lack of payoff compared to BH is a bonus. As for reviews comparing to drugstore makeup is fair in regards to quality, but I must say if you buy four blushes, four eyeshadow quads from Loreal that would cost you about $56 dollars total. And that's four shadows to a quad and you get six with em plus lip gloss.

So if you are unsure to purchase a life palette well just think what you'd need to by at the drug store to accomplish a similar look.",1
gOOD.sTUFF,1
This is not as large as my favorite Living Proof shower cap but it is big enough to hold my fine long hair & it keeps water out.  It's still new at this point & it digs in my ears if I keep it in one spot for a 20min shower so I find myself shifting it around.  I do have a decent sized head so that may be part of the problem!,1
I used it every other shampoo...,1
"I don't have a dark skin, many girls I know with the same skin color used it and it worked.

When I first used it, it did not indicate that my skin color is not suitable for the machine. So I set the energy level to 1 and tried it, it did not hurt .. then I set it to level 4 and used it on my arm. I didn't feel anything and it didn't hurt, after I am done doing my right arm I started  feeling a severe burn, I found red spots on my hands :(  like I was burned with fire. After an hour of pain it started to turn brown.

Now it's been two weeks and I have many dark brown spots on my arm. I stopped wearing short sleeves and I am very disappointed and depressed.

I have no idea what went so wrong to get this terrible result. Is it my skin color? If so then why the indicator did not work and stopped the machine?",0
My wife loves it that's all that matters,1
"I like that it works just as I need it to, I don't like the extra limey smell though",1
"I couldn't disagree more with the other reviewer - I think this is a wonderful product. It looks very natural, goes on smoothly, has a light and natural coverage, and most of all is good for your skin. I wish it had SPF 30 instead of SPF 15, that's my only complaint. Try it!",1
They work exactly as intended.  I had the same pair for 6 years and I'm sure they'll show up soon as I get done unpacking from a move.,1
"It's hard to buy a perfume without testing it first, so try to test before purchase.  This Burberry fragrance is pleasantly feminine.  It is not sporty, not bright and light, and I don't think it would be a teenager's choice.  Maybe it's a bit too heavy?  It sure does last!  I found I like the fragrance better as it aged.  For instance, I sprayed it on my wrist, then put on a cardigan sweater.  Days later I could still catch a whiff of it on my sweater sleeve.

This eau de parfum is potent, and you will want to use it sparingly.  Which leads me to the observation that the spray bursts out of the nozzle in a wide and strong pattern.  I'm used to more delicate, shorter sprays.

The bottle is hefty and very impressive.  Comes in a pretty box for gifting.",1
I received this product as a gift from my Dermatologist Friend. My skin is a combination skin. In the past I have used from Prevage to OTC ones from CVS. This product did miracles on my skin. I got 2 jars for free and then I felt uncomfortable to keep asking my friend. Glad to see the product on Amazon for this price. I highly recommend this cream. I use this with Retin A. My skin has been blemish free and smooth and well balanced :-),1
"This is a great ""curling"" iron even though it doesn't really curl. I wanted something bigger so I wouldn't end up with such curly/wavy hair with my smaller one. This 2 inch iron does not curl hair but it does create a smooth, full bodied look with little waves/curls at the bottom. I love it because it looks like I just got a salon blowout with just using this curling iron. If you want something to create ringlets, this isn't for you. If you like the just blown out smooth salon look, this is for you!",1
"Tried it, it did not work!!!",0
"It doesn't seems to do a lot for my curly hair. I bought it bcs of th positieve reviews, but don't like it very mucht, cant really describe why.
Doesn't make my hair smooth or shiny, don't like the smell, don't really like any of it :)",0
"Wow, this is a nice complement to the Milk Shake shampoo! Finally found the answer to tangled fine tresses !!  I use this in the shower after shampooing with Milk Shake shampoo, and it works much like the Pantene spray leave in product I used to be able to find [HTF the kind that works now] This Incredible Milk makes my baby fine hair soft, silky and I have even gotten compliments on the ""sheen"" of my hair, esp. outside in the sunshine. So I am a definite followup customer, and will be a faithful user of this [as well as the milk shake shampoo] This also has the same incredible smell that the shampoo has !!  I think the bottle will last a long time, since you only need a few squirts on it each use. I now find myself sitting and twirling my hair around my fingers because it feels so good, and I haven't done that for years !!",1
Not worth your money!!!!!,0
"Love everything L'Occitane, especially this hand wash and its matching lotion. It smells wonderful as well.",1
sent back,0
Not worth the money at all. I honestly feel like this isn't even the tell product.,0
"After all the great reviews, I was really thinking i would love this product, but I was disappointed. It is drying and does not stay on long. I have had much better luck with 9 dollar drug store lipsticks. For the price, I was truly expecting better. The color was nice while it lasted (which was like an hour).",0
"I have a pixie cut that tends to flatten out the next morning after washing the day before.  With this stuff, now my hair actually looks better the second day!  It poofs right up.  It makes my short, fine hair very piecey, which is the look I am going for.  I cannot believe there is a product that finally really does what it claims.  This is the holy grail for piecey pixie cuts.",1
The Hairmax Lasercomb I recieved was defective.  I could not get comb to come on.  The case it came in was new and I also believe the comb I recieved wasn't new it was a refurish comb that why it didn't work.,0
Neither lotion was sealed. It smells like someone mixed cheap lotion with the perfume and repackaged it. Will be returning. It has a lot of parabens also.,0
Purchased this some time ago and have just recently run out. I do believe I will purchase this item again. It does seem to lighten up age spots or sun damage but it does take some time. It's a bit expensive but if you use sparingly it should last for several months. Anyone trying to reverse sun damage and age spots knows that it does take time. If I could do a regimen of microdermabrasion and other facials more frequently in addition to this serum I'm certain that would assist in the process of lightening up dark spots and sun damage much more quickly. I do like the product and will likely make this purchase again in the near future.,1
Thread began to corrode after 4-5 months of normal use be aware. Air dry after use and store in air tight container with any desiccant or you'll end up paying more later on. just my experience.,0
I purchased this product thinking it can help with controlling my scalp itching but it didn't work after one and a half months of continuous use.,0
"I've liked other Klorane products I've used in the past. I saw this shampoo everywhere when I visited it Rome, so I was curious to give it a try. My hair was not happy...curiously dry, but with oily roots at the same time. No. Just, no.",0
"I've bought the original Blinc mascara because I have severe dry eye.  I was able to use artificial tears, it didn't flake or cause me any problems.  I needed to replace it and saw this new ""amplified"" version so I bought it.  For a dry eye sufferer it was torture.  It constantly flaked (and I only used a light application), and when I used my artificial tears it softened so the product was coming off and getting into my eyes.",0
Was sent a smaller bottle than what i was sold online. very disappointed but i needed it for immediate use or i would have returned it.,0
Love the shampoo.  Fast delivery,1
I don't think it did anything beneficial for my skin type,0
great product,1
"I was very disappointed in the weakness of this particular bottle.  When I have purchased this previously, in a store, the aroma was much stronger.  This one seems very diluted and the fragrance is gone almost immediately.",0
"Every time I wear this I'm asked ""what are you wearing, you smell wonderful""??  This has become my new signature cologne.  I just smile and say thanks!  It lasts all day long and will get compliments from men as well as women.  Wonderful fragrance!
It's worth the higher price due to the longevity of the scent lasting and the compliments I get constantly!",1
"I've been using this for years,  I have hereditary hair loss and no one notices bc my hair always looks so full.  This product can be messy but it does work amazing. I would definitely put your head in the shower area to apply it bc it can get everywhere and afterwards just set it with some hair spray. I always buy it online but the price has gone up substantially lately so I went to Harmon Face Values,  and got the. 97 Oz size for $33 with a Bed, Bath,  and Beyond coupon.  I like the convenience of buying online,  but not when they raise the prices like this.",1
This shampoo is terrible. There is nothing hydrating about it. It dried out my hair so much. It seemed really watery too. I used to use Pureology and I think I might go back to that. I will not be repurchasing this product.,0
Quality of the polish is fine however the color is much darker than the image suggest and does not really look green at all.,0
I can't get this to work on my hair.,0
It's a great curler for someone with small eyes and short eyelashes. It was kind confusing to use but it's curls amazingly,1
Just what my daughter wanted.,1
"I like it very much, but, hair is still falling out, though,  probably not as much.  This treatment  alone make my hair feel thicker.
I will purchase again.  ( I have only used it about 4 times).  Thanks",1
I JUST RECEIVE T THIS MAKE UP REMOVER AND  THE ONLY THINK I LIKE IS: VERY GENTLE TO SKIN BUT DOES NOT REMOVE THE MASCARA EASY . I USED COTTON AND I USED THE PRODUCT DIRECTLY TO THE LASHES BUT I STILL HAVE MASCARA,0
The smell is nice but it is not super moisturizing. It is still necessary for me to apply lotion after showering.,1
"I'm sure it's my fault for choosing a color online that looked pretty. This color seems to have a neon orange base. It feels okay, but the color is a disaster . It's not worth the $$.",0
Great product arrived when it said it would and is great with my new short hair cut,1
I have been using profoundly effective A for almost 10 years and I loved it. I was so sad when I saw that that they had rebranded and not only changed the price of the product but added additional ingredients to it. I decided to try it anyway and have had terrible reactions from it. My skin has changed and I am breaking out everywhere.  I will now be switching to a different brand and I am very disappointed. I hope they bring the old one back.,0
"Did not like this cream, dried my skin out.",0
Great product! Face glows after use!,1
I R3CEIVED BEFORE I LOEFT TOWN AND I WAS LEAKY AND LEAKED ALL OVER PACKAGING  I CANNOT USE SOMETHING THAT WAS DAMAGED,0
"I have been using C&E's Summer Hill lotion for years, absolutely love the scent and feel of it.  This is NOT Summer Hill, probably not even Crabtree and Evelyn.  Completely different scent, different texture, even different color - see the photo and you can tell very clearly it's not the same lotion.  Will not buy this one again.",0
This really gives shine to my hair without weighing it down. Will buy again.,1
Too soft for me. Could not apply properly,0
to heavy for my hair.... greasy after a day,0
I had tried it some time ago when I noticed my hair loosing body. It works really well on me.,1
This product definitely volumizes but the texture it leaves on your finger tips from massaging it on your roots is terrible and if you don't wash your hands right away it dries them out.,1
The package is broken when I received it. And the other drying mask I ordered was produced two years ago...Speachless,0
I like this cleanser. Efficient but gentle.,1
"This seems fake, the pigments are horrible. I'm really disappointed!",0
I LOVE this stuff I work for a plastic surgoen who recommends this or teamine to all patients. I used teamine for two years but switched to this as its cheaper. It works great no puffiness anymore and it is light but moisturizes great and eye makeup does not run,1
I would recommend tarte tarteist clay paint liner. This  one is light not very thick very liquid-y and doesn't make a nice solid black line. I never really liked my eyeliner line with this and i never felt it applied well. Once I switched to Tarte all my problems with natural/low toxin eyeliner and mascara went away.,0
"This eye shadow is for YOUNG women, not older women with lines since it magnifies each and every one!  I like Urban Decay much better!",0
"Does not fit my babyliss hairdryer at all.
Now- I have to send it back!",0
what can I say wish it could last but it looks good and easy to use I ordered it again,1
"Not so good for my type of hair. I have thick, wavy hair and it just made it blah.",0
"South Korean beauty and skin care products are all the rage. But are they really worth the hype? This mud mask left me with mixed feelings. Using the patch technology so popular in administering medications, it features a two piece mask. The box contains four, each individually wrapped. I am not sure who they used as  model for these but one size most definitely does not fit all. If you have small eye, a long nose and a big mouth in an oblong face, well you are in business. Application is a bit tricky. The mud (actually volcanic ash) infused mesh fabric is covered on one side by white plastic and the other a clear plastic wrapper. Remove the white and place over the face. Then peel the clear side away, pressing into position. Once you separate the mesh for the backing, it goes pretty quickly. The mask has a light, pleasant lemony fragrance. Leave on at least ten minutes. I left it on for twenty so that it dried completely. Peeling it off was a snap. Then rinse face with warm water. There was not much residue and it rinsed off cleanly and easily. There was no tightness or dryness and I experienced no negative reaction from this product.

I must say that after a session my skin looked and felt terrific. Pores did seem minimized and my skin looked fresh, smooth and healthy. It felt
soft,moist and smooth. Frankly, I wish this stuff came in a jar. The mask itself was clunky and although I don't mind looking temporarily like one of those Gray aliens that abduct people for the sake of beauty, the mask need major alteration to fit  the contours of my face. I also wish they had an unscented version. That beings said, the ends justify the means and the results overcame my objections to the method. It is not perfect and you will most likely need to perform surgery on the mask and still some areas will remain untouched by the mud, but overall, it was effective.",1
"A good paste but the smell is a little strange. I was described that it would be like tobacco leaves. Like you were walking into a cigar shop. It smells similar, but off. Can't explain it really but the hold is great and exactly what I expected from a paste.",1
What can I say.....I really like the way it smells and have had many nice comments from the ladies. They love it!,1
"I started buying this about 3 years ago and love it so much the fragrance is unisex so less in my tub.
I noticed about 2 years ago my husband started using it as well in the shower and he doesn't bulk at the price even a little because he loves it so much. Just One Problem you need to sell the larger bottle 18 oz I believe..bought it on one of the home shopping networks but I haven't been able to find it since.",1
Im so disappointed. My Rapido arrived and when I called to verify the serial number it was FAKE!!! Do not make the mistake. Babyliss products have the serial number on the handle of the dryer itself not the box. BE AWARE!,0
it makes your face  sticky and gummy.  Will not buy again,0
It's Okay.,1
"thBalm makes wonderful products and this palette is no exception.  I love that you get bronzer, blush, and highlighter in one convenient product.  Each one has lots of pigmentation so I'm sure it will last awhile.  I am fair skinned and the colors look good on my skin; a little definitely goes a long way with the bronzer especially and the blush a little less so.  If I had to say a negative, I would say I'm not crazy about the highlighter.  It doesn't show up as well as other highlighters unless you put a lot on, which is different from the other highly pigmented shades.  Regardless, this is a good product that really is a cost-effective way of trying out three different products.",1
Baught the curling iron hoping it would work on my silky hair and was disappointed. Does not curl fine hair well!,0
"I have a professional manicure once a month. In between times, I do my own nails. My nails are well conditioned and the professional manicure keeps my nails in top notch condition.

I noticed years ago that my manicurist always applied a base coat that acts as a layer to receive the nail color I want. Some base layers are glossy, I prefer those that are not. This Opi base is perfect. I start by applying  one coat to my left hand and then by the time my right hand is done, the left is ready for the nail color. The base is a necessity for me, and keeps my manicure you'd for at least a week. I usually use only Opi and Essie products, so I do know that I am using quality products.

Recommended. prisrob 10-03-13",1
Love the color!  Doesn't make my lips feel dry. Smells nice. I want to try a different color!,1
I had one of these for two weeks. The battery died with in this time frame. Though I loved the clean it gave my skin I could not remove the screws thats covered where the battery was located. I contacted customer support via email and received a response 5 days later telling me to remove the screws I couldn't remove. A filler had been used to seal to screws in that prevented a screw driver from removing them. Ended up having to throw it away.,0
"This is a very thick cream that detangles like magic. I will continue to use it because, paired with the Leonor Greyl shampoo, nothing else gets tangles out of washed hair like this does. I recommend it for anyone with mad curly hair like mine. But I do wish it were not quite so thick.",1
Glad I didn't buy the full size.,0
I like it because its not greasy and feels light on the skin.,1
"Having used it for about a week now, I noticed that I was getting a skin rash everytime. Upon doing some research on Vitamin E, I found out that Vitamin E in the form of Tocopheryl Acetate, which is present in this product, has the possibility of causing skin rash. I don't recommend buying this one in particular, eventhough it leaves your skin soft after a nice smooth shave. The only downside is the skin rash. I ordered the Green Proraso Shaving Cream to see what it's like, since I liked Proraso product, despite the skin rash.",0
NOT THE GREATEST COLOR,0
not sure what it does but it smells good,1
"bought my dryer 2 months ago and it stopped working, goes on and off while drying.  contacted t3 and they will not replace it, well they will for almost 100.00, they say amazon is not an authorized dealer whatever that means, how would I know, and it is their dryer.  they are the worst when it comes to customer service.  I will throw this dryer away and never purchase their products again. All I wanted from them is a replacement.
they suck and do not deserve even one star",0
This is water. H2O. You can clean with it. You can drink it. But the only thing it will cure is thirst. Don't be a fool. Save your money and perhaps the big A should be chastised for allowing this scam to be sold on their site.,0
Using biolage for almost 20 years. Used before detangler. This one works also well. Great fragrance and gives volume to hair.,1
"This tool works ok, but not as well as advertised.  I gave it two stars because you cannot clean it.  The roller does not come off.  I have spent a lot of time picking off the debris that collects around each tooth with a metal dental tool.  I would not buy this item again.",0
Seen a lot of reviews about the product and it's very good quality can't wait to use it I need to shave already,1
"Butter LONDON makes nail polish in incredible colors so i'm always tempted to buy them. However, the polish itself is incredibly watery, needs several coats to look decent, chips like whoa, and (given all of that) is pretty expensive.

But, I really wanted to like Butter! So, I bought the Butter base coat and top coat to see if that would somehow affect the quality of the polish---nope, just more money wasted. The only time I've been happy with this nail polish is when I bring it into my nail salon and have a professional apply it.

Pros
-Gorgeous Colors

Cons
-Chips all the time
-Thin, watery polish consistency that needs multiple coats
-Expensive for the quality
-Using their base coat and top coat did not help the end result",0
"Fungusfix did nothing for my fungus
I was told you need to shop around and try different products in this department.
Some products work better than others attacking fungus
Next I will try Tree Tea Oil",0
"This extremely expensive alpha hydroxy cream is marketed as a skin brightener and, in that sense, I guess it kind of worked since my skin was bright after a single use  BRIGHT RED that is.

After only an hour or so of wear  all indoors, so no sun exposure -- I began to have a terrible blotchy red reaction, and I don't have extremely sensitive skin. (Have only ever had one slightly bad reaction before, to a ROC cream.)

Washed my face multiple times and applied extra moisturizer, cold cream and, eventually, dots of Benadryl cream to calm the blotches. It wasn't painful, but it looked terrible and scary and I cant imagine what would have happened had I gone in sunlight, as this product specifically and adamantly warns against, or used it twice daily, as the directions instruct.

Yikes. Never again.",0
"This saved my hair. I got my dark brown hair lightened blonde and after the procedure by ends were very gummy even after a hair cut. It didn't look damage nor dry, but when wet the ends felt awful. After using the kale version tonic for only 2 weeks my ends didn't feel gummy anymore. They were actually healthy. My hair is in great condition. I would definitely recommend!!!!",1
I've been wearing this scent for 8 years. The liquid has always been clear and the scent has always been cotton candy. This is caramel colored and has no scent at all.,0
"Using Redermic UV during the day and the Redermic C at night got me a nice unsolicited ""your skin looks great!"" from my husband.  THAT's  saying something!  I've been using it for a couple months now.  You'll definitely see a difference!",1
Best shaving cream I have ever found. I have been a regular purchaser online because I live in the US since 2003. This is all I use.,1
"I love this shampoo. I have been using it for over a year my hair has grown, its silky smooth and shiny.",1
I would find a spray.  if you touch your skin with this it looks like you've been bruised!,0
"Accidentally ordered this product instead of the moisturizing shampoo, it is awful. Doesn't lather, and my hair does not feel clean. Also has a fake floral scent. Tried to return but as it sat in my cupboard for too long while I finished my last bottle I lost my opportunity. Don't waste your money.",0
"I was disappointed. This is a pricey product, and I didn't see any difference after a few months. Maybe it works better for younger people, I am in my mid fifties. I find cheaper moisturizers  work just as well.",0
I returned the product. The coverage was not as good as advertised,0
Great stuff!!!,1
"I have terrible nails. Soft. They tear. Have splits. I have tried everything over the years. Finally spent several years with nice looking acrylic nails. However, constantly having to get fills. So I saw this product and ordered it. I don't have perfect nails but with this product I can have natural nails that I don't need to hide. I am thrilled to have found this product.  Truly",1
"not for me; it's silicone based, and it never blended with my water based moisturizer. it also left a significant white cast on me. however, I gave it to a friend and it works beautifully for her, so to each their own!",0
Seems to be the same product as at the salon but without the pink coloring.,1
It replenishes moisture around my eye's,1
I had high expectations for this brush.. I have cruly hair and my hair is 98 percent of the time straight wavy as I don't like my hair getting tangled when cruled. This brush is supposed to help you get body easily and help hair get dry faster well I was glad I didn't throw away my old brush cause I surely needed it.,0
Great product,1
"It feels like it had sand in it. Maybe old product, maybe damaged formula, it feels like rubbing sugar on your face.",0
Didn't really work that well for me. Had a bad smell to it.,0
I hate that the on /off and temp button is flat. Its difficult to turn on and off when I'm drying each section of my hair. Ive broken my nails every time I use it. The heat element is great but I wish there was a comb attachment.,0
I prefer Shellac to Gelish mainly because the removal takes far less time.  Faux Fur is a great fall/winter color ! I remove a star due to the product not being available in retail stores for consumers and the high mark up cost.,1
Not stay that long,0
I love Pevonia products. My spa recommends these and they are much less than what the sell them for. Although the Spa is now offering at a lower cost because of these Amazon offerings some are still much less than buying it through them.,1
"Not the real thing or just poorly made.  Be careful of replicas & it's not always the Sellers fault.  However, Beauty products sold wholesale or wholesale period, or from China always fake.  Think Seller? It also fell apart in 2 weeks.  It's gone in garbage many weeks ago. I should have returned.",0
The iron shuts off while using it. It does not remember where my last temp was set. Going to send it back.,0
"Somehow, this product gave me a headache, literally. I returned it.",0
"I bought 2 cans.  The first can was empty after only one use.  I figured it was either defective or I I pushed on the sprayer to hard or something.  When I used the next can I was very careful to press down lightly and only use a few squirts.  It was empty the next time I went to use it as well.  What a waste of money.

Update:
I wanted to update that I contacted the seller and was issued a full refund.",0
"I shave nearly everyday for work. I was looking for a new product that didn't break me out, or caused ingrown hair from pores clogging up. I was introduced to Jack Black years ago, and let's just say I've devoted to this line for the rest of my life. Get everything made by them because it is effective, and leaves your face smooth and fresh like fresh laundry out of the dryer.",1
For it to actually look gold you needed about 4 coats and it was very thin and too yellow looking.,0
"My hair stylist had to change the organic hair color in order for me to get a long lasting color. Yes, I spend more money with her to do this if instead I would color my own hair, but I don't want the hassle. Once she got the color brand I needed to get the longer life to color I wanted, I started to experiment with the Color Lover brand. Unbelievably for me, it allows me to go about 6 to 7 weeks before another coloring is needed. Now, I stopped washing my hair everyday years ago. Maybe it also has something to do with washing (and conditioning) once every 3 to 4 days, but Color Lover works for me. I love it.",1
"I usually get weekly manicures and by day five it is usually chipped or the edge of nails wore down. A manicurist used the CND Weekly Top coat and by the time of my next manicure I really did not need the manicure.  My manicure lasted and there was just slight wear at the tips of the nails, and the nail color (not CND brand)  stayed shiny all week from the CND Top Coat. At my job I have to wash my hands hourly and this made it through better than any other top coat I have tried. I did not buy from this seller and purchased it directly from the salon. Very impressed with this top coat.",1
"Buyer Beware!  I hardly ever write reviews and have never written a negative one...  However the pump on the bottle broke after the first use.  I emailed the company several times and never heard back.  Then I called several times and got the run around.  Then I called and I thought made progress.  The lady gave me a return code and said to send it back and they would replace it.  Well, I did several months ago and nothing has been sent back to me.  I spent $45 only to lose it. Lot of time lost and frustration.  Plus the loss of money.",0
"Wow... what is this, cosmetics wars? You have the 5 star reviews supposedly by the people who work for the product line, and then a load of 1 star reviews by people, who have a different problem - one of whom gives every product by this company 1 star, but still purchases the items the company offers, only to keep giving it 1 star. Now if I get something from a company that gets only 1 star, I probably won't be getting more of their products.
It just seems a little odd and a little hard to believe either of the 'camps' reviews. I also noticed that Vine reviewers, who are totally impartial, give their honest opinions and are 'voted down' because they are giving it 3 - 5 stars (not just 1 star) - in other words giving *honest reviews* and which are obviously not making some people happy.  Seriously??

Moving on: I got this product to review through the Amazon Vine program.  I love eye shadow palettes and was excited to try something new.  This palette is okay but definitely not worth the price.  It came with a travel compact as well (a small compact to put your choice of eye shadows, blush, lipstick in).

The Good:
- The eye shadows did appear to be packed well, I didn't have much trouble with fallout.
- The blush had decent staying power
- The lipstick went on nicely
- The case is very solid and includes a tool to swap the different trays between the large palette and the travel compact.

The Neutral:
- This is a mostly neutral eye shadow palette there are some greys and some mauves.  Two of the eye shadows have a very nice gold shimmer to them.
- Most of the eye shadows are glittery.  There are only a few matte shadows in here.  So if you are a big matte eye shadow fan this isn't the palette for you.

The Bad:
- The eye shadows do not have much pigmentation.  Not nearly as good as Urban Decay or even The Balm eye shadow palettes I have.
- The eye shadow brush included is better than the foam applicator included in most drugstore eye shadows but still not all that useful.  I used it once and then never used it again.
- The eye shadow trays are different sizes which is just weird, so you can only grab certain ones for your travel compact.
-  The blush isn't very pigmented (I love my Tarte Amazonian Clay blush much better).
- The two orange/brown colors in the blush were just off and looked really strange on (I have olive colored white skin)
- There really isn't a good way included to apply the lipstick so I applied with  my fingers
- The lipstick didn't have any staying power and it's not very portable so it isn't easy to reapply.  It also was very drying to my lips.
- The palette and travel compact are very heavy.
- The tool to change out the palette was hard to use and I kept dropping the trays on top of other trays (and denting the other eye shadows) when I tried to change them.
- The palette has only shallow grooves for the transfer tool and the included eye shadow brush, so they kept falling out whenever I picked up the palette to use it...it was sooo irritating.
- The travel compact has absolutely no place for a small eye shadow brush, this is really weird and makes it pretty much useless for throwing into your purse.

Overall I wouldn't recommend this palette.  I would recommend sticking to the better pigmented Urban Decay eye shadows.  If you do want a great eye shadow/blush palette The Balm's Balm Voyage palette is absolutely awesome and nearly half the cost of this one.",0
"I have ordered Toppik before and it must have been the real thing because it worked better. This one
is like dust and doesn't look like hair at all. I recommend trying another product on Amazon. Perhaps
the price has something to do with this but it is not the Toppik brand and does not work as well.",0
"Everthing okay, arrived in time, was good packed, how it should be, Im really satisfied with everything thanks for sure will buy on this side again",0
Love how this makes my hair look!  Like I've spent the day at the beach.,1
Nice curling iron for BIG curls!  Heats quickly and allows you to choose temperature.  It is a bit scary as it seems like it would be easy to fry your hair if you are not careful with the temperature settings!,1
This product has meet and exceeded expectations. Leaves skin lastingly soft. Smells wonderful as well. Will definitely purchase again in the future.,1
I didn't notice any difference will not try again,0
"I purchased the hairdryer for my up coming U.S
Trip,so I know it will be for straightening my curly hair!! BaByliss is a good brand.",1
This is my second safety razor. Its definitely a step up from the one that came with the starter set I purchased a few weeks back. Shaved with it just now and I'm very impressed with the way it felt and handled.,1
"I wanted Creative Nail Design, Gotcha #130, which is a beautiful shade of deep pink with a hint of shimmer.

You sent Creative Nail Design, Gotcha #116, which is a flat, dull and boring shade of ordinary pink.",0
"I do love NIA products.  I have used quite a few, but my favorite is Skin Strengthening Complex.  I have been using this for years under by makeup.  I am using this product as well, but use it for a night cream.",1
I bought this because of the good reviews. Didn't work for me at all. Left me with blurry vision. Other cleansing oils work far better and can be used for the entire face.,0
"Very thick, did not blend onto skin at all even with their brushes that I also purchased.",0
"good packaging and shipping.  great product, I have been using this gel for 10 years at least.  It is not sticky and gives the hold I need.",1
Excellent. Quick service & great product.,1
Bought it for my husband. it works really good.,1
Great blow dryer. Very quiet.,1
"old, streaky not opi product I know",0
The product does what it says it will.  Very happy with it and will buy again.  $$ but worth every penny.,1
Great pigmentation and long lasting quality.  I usually use the naked palette from Urban Decay and have been looking for an alternative. This palette has the perfect colors and the quality I expect.  The colors look darker than they apply.  The green isn't my favorite but looks nice blended.,1
Made my hair very frizzy. Did not work for me!,0
great gel,1
Love the subtle gold/bronze color - my new go to neutral.  Long lasting and came well packaged.,1
"This is my second bottle of the product.  My results have not been as good as many who wrote review.  But, as far as eye creams go, this one does go on smoothly, absorb cleanly, and moisturize pretty well.",1
"I ordered the Perfecter. Unfortunately it did not curl my hair and only created static.  I just missed the boat with returning it for a refund...fine, I can accept that.. I am now trying to stop the Achieve 10 that is being auto-delivered to my house monthly (that I did not order). I called customer svc and they told me it would stop and it has not! I just received another bottle today and my credit card will be charged another $19.99! I am also getting the ""free"" (for now) magazine subscription of 3 different magazines. I also told customer svc, I wanted that to stop too. They told me they could not find me in the system. I was given 5 different phone numbers and got no where. They have absolutely no one in customer svc that can assist me nor can I find an e-mail to write to someone at this point. I am concerned that at some point, I will start getting charged for these magazines that I do not want. If I am not in the system, then how am I receiving the magazines? Please get me out of this Achieve 10 and magazine subscription hell!",0
"I am very, very disappointed in this Borghese product.  I always used Rimini Rose Frost and it was the absolute best all the way around so I trusted Borghese products for many, many years.  The company does not make this color anymore and told me to mix to other colors, but did not do the trick.  My husband used to drive a 100 miles round trip for me to buy this product, he would always buy whatever amount the store had in stock.  O.K., well, back to the Peonia Peach, it has an old taste to it and I don't like it at all.....I will have to think twice before buying their lipsticks again.  They used to be the best you could buy, lasted all day even after eating, but no satisfaction now.",0
I like the Gold version better.,1
"I was nervous to buy this because so many of  the reviews said they had issues with their's being fake, but when I saw the Black Friday pricing I decided to take the risk. I love this flat iron, mine was a real babyliss, and it works great. I have very curly/ frizzy hair and it works so well and straightens my hair.",1
I really like this face wash. It works and I won't have to buy face wash for awhile. Woot woot!,1
"For those who are considering buying this item, make sure you notice the size of this Sunscreen stick. It is really small, but it fits pretty well in purse to carry around. I am giving a 4 start because the cream is a lot thicker than I expected, and sometime is a little hard to apply evenly on to the skin.",1
"love this, make hair shining, but still a little expesive",1
"My husband found the resulting shave to be very easy and smooth, with a  far superior result than he gets from his conventional  shaving foam. His skin felt very smooth and soft.  The  fragrance is subtle and not overwhelming and is very definitely Bulgarian Lavender ( I have a flight of Aromatherapy Lavender essential oils for comparison). While lavender oils are not the most expensive  oils the quality of the product does justify the cost.  This is a really nice product and would be a perfect gift  for a special occasion or a good personal care item.  My husband said it took very little product  to get a great shave. The set we received is the full size product and it should last a long time which makes it more affordable than we initially assumed. This is also a very good unisex product quite suitable for legs etc.  update June 2017, my spouse asked me to reorder the shaving cream because he is almost out of the original jar we got over 2 years ago, still the most comfortable shave ever and one jar lasted over 2years the cost for the cream is about what he was spending on foam shave  cream every other month.",1
"This thin watery product has no body at all and does not show up. I was very disappointed seeing it was what J Lo wears, but no way.",0
I was disappointed in this product after I saw their ingredients.  Nothing but bad chemicals and Formaldehyde!!!  I bought the DeLore Nails organic nail hardener and nail polish dryer.  So much better.  Cannot recommend this product and will not buy again.,0
"I have been using this for several weeks now and I honestly don't see any difference in my hair by using this product, in fact, my hair was better, shiner, & softer when I was using Suave( keratin infusion). I could have stocked up with a years supply of Suave for what I paid for this. Will not purchase again and I may ask for a refund as this stuff is way overpriced for what it does.",0
Beware!  Tjhe scent has been changed to an old lady floral scent.  NOTHING like the original fresh and clean scent from before.  I wish I had known because this stuff is not cheap.,0
I received it today and us it .... makes my hair soft and less tangled. .,1
This product does not heat up enough for me.  I returned it.,0
The container stopped pumping the retinol. It is stuck in the container.,0
Love this color!!,1
"Can I give this product 0 stars?
1. I have freckly skin with brown hair - apparently this product doesn't work for that color combo, and it doesn't say anywhere that it doesn't. I'm telling you if you have freckles, don't waste your time on this product. I have used it for 6 months, and still have to shave every 2.5 days. Same as the day I bought it.
2. Buyers on Amazon beware! They don't use the same return policy as buying it directly from TRIA, so you can't return it after 3 months for a refund if it doesn't work - I found that out the hard way. They just sent me a replacement. So I've used it for another 3 months, still no joy. Do I get a refund? NO. So what to do with this product that I can't refunded and doesn't work...",0
"Love this powder, it's my go to, but this one was supposed to be light like the label says but it's more like a medium.",0
"It doesn't work.  There is the pain, little else.",0
I love this mascara. I have oily skin and this is the only mascara that doesn't run all over my face by the end of the day...love it!,1
"totally orange color, yuk looks nothing like picture",0
Stays till the end of the day in the winter but doesn't do so well with humidity.,1
I've been using this liner for quite some time now.. Now my sisters and mom uses it!,1
This gave me. No color would not buy again,0
would have liked more color,0
"I live in Florida where sun exposure is a given. I'm not a big beach person, but v-neck t-shirts and tanks tops have been staples in my wardrobe on and off throughout my life here. Which means that skin between my shoulder blades has seen its share of sun--and I'm quite fair skinned.

So, I can't say that I've seen any real difference as far as eliminating creases in the area, but I would say I like this very much simply as a skin cream. It's thick, but soaks in quickly and doesn't leave a greasy feel at all, and a little goes a long way. The scent isn't my favorite--it reminds me of the scented powder my grandmother used to wear and I really don't want to smell like a grandmother in my 40s--but the scent also dissipates rather quickly. The amount of product you get for the price is pretty good as well. I'd say I recommend it as a nice skin cream, but don't expect miracles.",1
Great color!  Gets so many compliments !,1
"I love eyeshadows, especially sparkly ones and this one had a nice amount of sparkle. I do not wear a lot of makeup but I do love Clinique products so I will compare it to those.

I love the beige color on the top left ""Frost & found"". It enhances my eyes without making me look like I am wearing too much makeup. Again, I like the sparkly color. I noticed some other reviewers said it did not show up on their fair skin. I am a natural blond with green eyes and pale skin and I thought the color looked nice and I could definitely tell I was wearing eyeshadow.

The pink, top right, barely shows up at all unless you want to spackle it on. As subtle as the color is, it made me look like I had some sort of eye rash or pinkeye, which is not really the message I want to convey to anyone.

The brownish color bottom left, ""Mink it over"" is OK. I tried blending it with the beige color and it looked OK but I was not terribly taken with the color or the way it made my eyes look.

The darkest color, ""Time to un-wine"" is AWFUL. It does not go with the rest of the palette and is so dark I looked like a raccoon or I had lost 10 rounds with someone in a boxing ring. Even trying to blend it for a smoky look with another color still made me look like I had black eyes.

So overall, I would just like a larger version of the beige color as that seems to be the one that looked the best. I think this comes off fairly easily with a mild remover, which is nice. I don't think I would get this again though.",0
Does not seem to be the original nano.  Burns my hair and have to straighten my hair in very thin amounts at a time.  Very dissapointed with this purchase.,0
The items may be great for others but these products left my face extremely dry with scars on my face.  I now have to see a dermatologist to help clear.,0
Not original. Paid $60 for something I could bought for $20 on EBay. Smell last less than an hour. Unless you want to walk around with the cologne l,0
"I like the Ouidad Products,specially Deep Treatment Curl Restoration Therapy,but i can't say the same for the Shampoo curl Quencher.",0
"Terrible soap!  Does NOT lather whatsoever with a brush.  Enough said Don't bother.
On the other hand, it does smell excellent so it is a nice shower soap.",0
"I tried this for dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.  When I use this product at night, I see an increase in puffiness under my eyes in the morning.  I have tried this multiple times and I consistently wake up with eyes that look more swollen and puffy.  My eyes look better in the morning  when I don't use this product.  I get much better results with L'Oreal's Youth Code under eye cream (and that costs 20 dollars).",0
This product made my scalp break out and the seller never got back to me on how or where to return it for a refund. Never again,0
feel asthought gap is a bit small good for price.,1
I will keep buying this Sebastian product,1
"Great product, fast delivery.  Will buy again.",1
Excelente,1
This hand lotion does absolutely nothing that is claims to do.,0
Made me break out :( I think it is not the authentic product. Buy straight from the avene website instead.,0
"The best! I wear this everyday to take the place of wearing heavy foundation and get the sun protection. Also, put it on my daughter's face before swim lessons and she has never burned.",1
"great stuff, but maybe next they should be more careful...I received mine all dented.",0
I have pretty large pores and shrinking them is my next experiment after clearing up most of my acne. I really doubted that I would find a product that would help reduce the size of them...but this really has been working. The only bad thing is that it smells really bad... that's why there is minus one star.,1
I got some very uneven highlights and I got this spray to try to even them out. I've been using this spray everyday for 2 months. I'm outside everyday for lunch for a half hour. My hair is dark brown but I'm noticing some lighting it's  subtle. See the photos for before and after 2 months of use,1
"I bought this specifically to go with my Babyliss hairdryer. After a couple uses it MELTED! I only use the diffuser in the summer when the weather is humid, so I had bought this last year and just got it out for storage. I wish I could get a refund, but the return window has closed. This is poor customer service.",0
Nice conditioner that will make your scalp tingle and your hair well conditioned. I recommend.,1
"ordered for wife ,happy wife happy life works for me",1
Very dissatisfied. Smelled old and did not smell even close to the sugar bought previously in Sephora or Kohls. Ended up buying there after being disappointed,0
"I gave four stars because the box was  very battered, this was a gift and I was very disappointed with the box, but other than that everything else was good.",1
"Good product, leaves my face feeling clean. Just use a small amount for good results (morning and bedtime), no dryness or irritated skin. Has a light fresh scent.",1
Dryer stopped working in less than 5 months. Not impressed.,0
"I received this with a broken ""Paul Mitchell"" knob on the side which is unfortunate. Also, my package was shipped the day it said to be delivered. However, I have had it for 2 days and have enjoyed it!",0
"I wanted to switch brands and take a break from LiLash and see what else worked for a little cheaper. This worked some, but didn't take over from when I was using LiLash, so I had to wait a month before it even looked like my lashes were a bit longer. My lashes got a little longer but not thicker, and not half as long as LiLash did. For $85+ it wasn't worth it to me, I'm going back to LiLash.",0
I am allergic to this product.,0
Strong lemon smell.,0
"Great product to have personally or professionally. Also great for sensitive skin, eyes and stuuborn makeup",1
Not really as helpful as the Neuma products,0
Use if you have very oily skin!! Also if you have any broken skin it will hurt like hell!!! The only reason why I'm not giving this a five stars is because it really does overdry your skin if you're not having a severe breakout my suggestion is to bust a pimple first then put the lotion on the open-pore after you've gotten the pus out LOL not to be gross however the next morning when you wake up you will be zit free but only if you bust it first!! Btw it will hurt like hell and DO NOT SHAKE UP THE BOTTLE!! Dip a Q-til in the pink lotion and then pull it through the clear and immediately put on the pimples,1
I bought this straightener and the first time using it the light would turn off and it would shut off. Then I'd turn it back on and after a few minutes that same thing would happens. Now it won't stay on for more than a few seconds. I made the mistake of throwing the way the box after I opened it and now am stuck with a straightener that does not work at all.,0
burns  will never buy it again  some ingredient is too strong for my skin  do not like it,0
"Horrible, hazard, stay away, smells weird, fake!",0
"I love the color but after the third day, the polish starts to peel off.. I was very disappointed with this product.",0
"This is my least favorite of the XEN-TAN self tanners I have tried. It doesn't have the usual nasty faux tan smell, but I'm not crazy about the smell it does have. It is flowery and powdery in my estimation. Someone else may think it smells ok, but it's a scent that I like to avoid. The color was also somewhat darker than I prefer. I have used XEN-TAN dark tan creams and they have worked well for me, going on smoothly and subtly on my very light, white skin. But this one went on dark with a hint of orange. As I said, I'm very, very white, so someone with darker natural skin color may have an entirely different experience. I do think XEN-TAN makes the best self tanners available. I have been impressed with how different they are from even the St. Tropez and Clinique faux tanners that I used to like. My favorite XEN-TAN is the XEN-TAN Mousse Intense Weekly Tan, which has a wonderful vanilla scent, goes on ultra-smoothly, and gives a more subtle, buildable tan that lasts.",1
"The cap came with a crack in it.  Whenever I spray my hair, hairspray drips out and gets all over the floor.",0
Had a horrible chemical smell like ammonia or windex. None of the other items I purchased in this line had any odor. The top plunger part seemed like a different color from the bottle. Not sure if it was tampered with since you can screw off the plunger and the box was opened. Wouldn't purchase this item here again. Returning item for a refund. Will buy in stores to try item.,0
"This is not the real stuff. Either CHI has changed this product, or this is an imposter or bad run of the product. I have used CHI spray wax for more than a year and it usually smells delightful and holds curl beautifully without getting crunchy. This can, however, smells like straight alcohol and dries my hair like a cheap drugstore hair spray. Just terrible.",0
complete waste of money as the item came with a two prong plug and only works using 120voltage. would have cost more money to ship back. so bought a voltage converter for 36.00. AS SOON AS I PLUGED IN THE CURLERS IT COMPLETLEY BURNED OUT!! didn't even get the chance to curl a strand of hair. IT'S ALL GONE IN THE DUSTBIN. Gutted as they would have been great if i lived in the US.,0
"About 20 years ago (ugh feeling old), this was THE perfume/cologne that the cool kids wore. I decided recently that it still smells pretty darn good and wanted to go retro like the secret hipster that I am. Everyone in their 30s & 40s recognizes the scent even if they don't know exactly that it's CK1. My only complaint is that it can give me a headache. Worth it.",1
This is a fake. Bought the real item from my hairdresser after I paid to have my highlights redone because this shampoo stripped my hair. Showed the product to my stylist and she confirmed it is fake or has been tampered with. I have a prime membership and have enjoyed Amazon immensely until this past year. I do not have any suggestions for Amazon to deal with and stop this type of fraud. Feel like I lost a good friend.,0
"I chose this rating as the product was received very quickly, no fuss, no muss!  Color and quality of product is perfect.",1
"The reviews for this product are so all over the map and the cost quite pricey I had to think about this purchase for awhile - obviously I made the leap.

The fat girl slim cream that came with this is the only complaint I have - really does not work well in conjunction with the machine - after applying and beginning the use of the machine, the cream became sticky and gloopy.  I didn't even finish the tub (and it's a really, really small tub).  I am now using my favorite celullite cream, after applying this I do apply baby oil to help with the gliding of the machine.

Now on to the machine - it took me a bit to get use to holding it and using it on my area of treatment (my upper thighs and buttocks).  After a few uses I finally got the handle of it.  It really is now a breeze and I have slowly worked my way up to the higher suction settings.

Yes - the suction needs time to get use to - it pinches - I have a high tolerance for pain so can not agree with other reviewers.  My one piece of advice - stock up on some arnica cream - you will get bruises.  Not horrible, but enough that I was a bit embarrassed changing at the gym.  Not huge bruises, more like hickies.  Over time I no longer am bruising - why?  Cuz this machine delivers on it's promise.

I have been using this now for 2 months and have noticed a considerable difference in the appearance of my cellulite (about 40%) plus my skin really appears firmer.  Even my boyfriend has noticed the big difference.",1
Obviously an old product... sludge.,0
Good buy. This is one product to be tried definitely. Strong odor. Perfectly suitable men's spray!,1
"smells good, doesnt last long at all. no worth the $$. Get armor all deodorant, smells better, lasts longer and doesnt have aluminum in it and costs a fraction of this.",0
"I have this also in medium and it was very moisturizing but for some reason this was shade ivory and not moistirizing at all, actually drying. I would return but not worth it.  At least the ingredients are good for you...I like to mix both shades but this is too dry.",0
"I wanted to give it a 5 star, but held back.  I am very senior citizen with aging, thin skinned hands.  That means easy bruising by just hitting the tops of your hands on anything... regardless of how hard the contact.  I truly believe that the purple bruise spots have decreased a great deal.  I actually received the larger tube as a gift later this month... So yes, I say I am very pleased..",1
Great cream at about $20 a tube. Okay at best for $38!,0
look out ladies! my favorite for special occasions.,1
Infinite shine is terrible. Starts chipping within one or two days. Not shiny at all! :( don't waste your money!,0
This is my second time!!! Same problem again!! The top heater doesnt work after I used for few times,0
I have dry skin which was caused by a reaction from a popular anti aging company. Used topical steroids alternately with oral pills because of inflammation and swelling from reaction from products too used by esthetic peels and whatever process to help ease down my skin but nothing helped not Til I tried these line of products by Image. I used it since December and I am ok for now.,1
Worth it. I like the tube it comes in has no spf to clog my pores and doesn't have an awful smell.,1
"Chose product based on reviews. Yes ,very strong fragrance that lasted for hours. Personally, I found it offensive. After multiple attempts, it continues to leave a fine, powdery residue on my dark hair. Packaging was adequate and it shipped as stated. Unreturnable given product type and special handling. Expensive mistake.",0
just visited a dermatologist a few days ago. he said my face skin was really good. i give this credit to L'oocitane. my favorite skincare product.,1
First time out of the box it died after five minutes.  In this amount of time it got so hot it melted the tip. Hate to think what would have happened to my hair if I had actually used it.  Safety hazard in my opinion.  DO NOT BUY.,0
"After watching miss universe girls using this, I had to get it, I had great expectations seeing how easy it was. Well, it depends on your hairstyle! If you have straight thin hair, maybe yes. But if you have layered hair or thick hair, tough luck!

The clip is so short it doesn't clamp your hair properly, esp if you have layererd hair. I wanted it to work so badly & really didn't mind paying that mount coz it looked so idiot proof on tv. But wait, analyze  your hair type first before you buy. So I have to go back to my traditional babyliss (best brand of hair styling tools) curling wand with a full length clamp.",0
just doesn't work. expensive and has little nutrition. started taking biotin and hoping i have better results. my postpartum loss of hair is ridiculous!,0
"Great floral scent, but couldn't actually burn it. There was no wick to speak of, so it went out after a few seconds. Will try on a candle warmer. Very disappointing !!!",0
"Very disappointed. The cap on the polish had leaked and practically glued the square cap to the bottle. Just got it today and since I can't return it, I had to just throw it away.",0
Product did not work for me,0
"I really wanted to like this, and my most counts I do. The ingredients are not nearly as scary as some face creams and It does a great job of moisturizing while not feeling greasy in the least. I didn't really notice any ""correction"" on my fine lines, but honestly I didn't expect to since I keep my face well moisturized and use other, similar products. Well that and the fact that I couldn't make myself keep using it beyond a short trial period. I would continue to use this, but as my review title indicated...the smell. For a product touting that it is 93% natural, you would think they would have toned down the perfume, but nope. this stuff smells so strongly that I could smell it on the washcloth when I washed my face that night. I'm pretty sensitive to strong perfumes; they're a major migraine trigger for me, so I'm calling it quits with this correcting cream. There are plenty of other products out there that don't make my face smell like the scent isle at the dollar store.",1
"works great, alittle costly",1
Had it for a year and now it won't turn off unless you unplug it. Ridiculous for a $200 hair dryer.,0
"I have fine noticeably thinning hair so thought I would give System 2 a try.  The shampoo and scalp cond. are not bad; noticed that not as much hair falls out.  The scalp treatment.....I would definitely not recommend it.  It is a foam and the first time I used it, it left my hair dull, stiff, and sticky. When I tried to brush it out, large clumps of hair were in my brush.  Would recommend using the scalp treatment in System 3 - that works; it is a liquid spray.",1
"I tried to like this, but the smell was overwhelming.  It has a really strong pumpkin scent that seems like it never goes away.  I will be giving this away.",0
Smells good,1
Good product.,1
"Ahava is a good product, and leaves the hands soft and smooth.  I will order it again. It also works well as a foot ceam.",1
"It's really gooey, smells very strange.  I can feel tingling when I put it on, but do not see any immediate changes.  Would not buy again.",0
"Love these curling irons.  Effective, quality and reasonable price.",1
Have tried it for a month now and pretty disappointed.  Doesn't seem to work at an even pace no matter what i do.  Some parts of my skin feel like they are sucked in by the machine; other parts of skin nothing!  BTW I am fifty years old.,0
"Very happy with this model so far. I have very thick, straight hair and this babyliss keeps my hair shiny and free from fly aways.  Great color too",1
"does exactly what it says,  can't complain about that",1
"Continually use this stuff - I love it. Have determined that the way it makes the hair thicker is to separate out the strands more, creating the illusion of more coverage.

Originally I wasn't sure if that method would really be beneficial, especially having come from so many other methods that actually thicken the diameter of your hair itself, temporarily most often. I won't be switching back.

Leaves my hair very soft and seems to avoid leaving a residue behind. I couple it with the Paul Mitchell Awapui shampoo and am convinced that the combo cleans and visually thickens my hair better than any other method I've tried.

If you're a guy and really losing your hair and want an actual solution then ask your doc about Propecia. I love this conditioner but it would be worthless without the hair that Propecia regrew.",1
"I wanted to give this a 4.5 because its almost perfect.
Get if you do make up on the road or on location and need to clean your brushes quickly and don't have a bathroom to do it in, it's great.
Its get most of the old make up off the brushes and dries quickly. For $17 its a bit pricey for me, but I'll probably get it again if the occasion arises.",1

"Wait till you see the ingredient list when you get your package. You'll be like, ""What?!"" I was really disappointed, and didn't want to be. Full of siloxanes, parabens, lauryl sulfates, etc. The ingredient lists of the products are as thick as a script. And many of them are not good ingredients. If you want your face to feel like an irritated comedogenic, greasy/oily mess, then these products are for you. I used it once, and said, ""Eeek! Yuck!"" I returned it 2 days later. The foil chrome and labels will rub off the containers in a short time.

The cleanser alone has over 4 different types of lauryl sulfates in it :/  On the tv commercials Cindy and her Parisian  dermatologist friend go on and on about the melon extract in these products, however that ingredient is a salt and pepper dusted ingredient next to the plethora of questionable ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfate, a numerous amount of parabens, ammonium hydroxide, disodium edta, phenoxyethanol , ceteraryl ethohexonate, ethers, alcohols, etc, etc. Those types of substances make up the bulk of the ingredients for the serums, cleansers, motisturizers. It doesn't matter what it is, they all contain ""scary"" ingredients. Seriously, you could make your own skin care far better than this overpriced stuff

The problem probably isn't when you put them on your skin, but what happens when they're absorbed by the skin. What kind of effect are they having on your body. Many have been suspect of being endocrine disrupters and carcinogens. This is cheap drug store quality skin care sold at a premium price. And I just like stuff that is more natural. I'm the kind of person that picks aloe vera leaves from my garden and grinds them up for use later on my face and body

Some might say it is my fault I didn't ask for an ingredient list before I bought the stuff, but who would think to do that based on who is advertising this stuff and the emphasis they put on the botanical sources in the products from the tv commercials.

And I highly doubt that Cindy has remained youthful looking all these years because of this stuff that she sells over the airwaves. We all know what millionaires use. They certainly don't use stuff like this.

If you return this stuff, make sure you call the number on the label and don't ship it to the address you see on the package. That's the local fulfillment warehouse. They can't help you with crediting your account. You have to call and send it back to the main warehouse in the Midwest, then your account will get credited in a timely manner.",0
"I ordered this nail scrub based on the instruction on the CND website on how to apply Shellac.  It seems to work well; I just wonder if it is an absolutely necessary step of the process.  I wonder if just washing your hands in soap and water would be enough, or if it would leave a residue.",1
The box says my scalp should turn slightly red and tingle with use. I have nothing. There was talk in the reviews about counterfeit products being recieved. Im going to go purchase a bottle of the same stuff from a salon and do a little comparison. I hope I don't tingle or there will be hell to pay.,0
"Great product! I like this brand a lot and will continue buying it. One of these last me about a year, using it about 3 times a week to shave. Highly recommend. Nice scent.",1
it started working the very first time I took it. That burning sensation you get feels like your truly burning a lot of fat.,1
I use it occasionally to prevent acne from dead skin cell buildup and it works great.  I do wish they would put just a little more liquid in each jar so that the pads stay drenched down to the last one.,1
"Quick absorbing moisturizer that's great for summer.  Ahava can be a bit pricey, but I find that you always get what you pay for with their products.  I prefer oil over lotion for daily use when getting out of the shower - and this product fits the bill.  There is really no such thing as ""dry"" oil, so if you don't like oil- or find it a bit greesy- you will not like this oil- dry or not.  However, I have  tried  all of them... neutrogena, palmer's, Rite Aid and CVS's own brands of the various after shower oils.  It is a bit pricier than Neutrogena's sesame or  unscented oil (the closes comparable in my opinion), but Ahava does have the best fragrance.  And is easier to travel with (less chance of spillling all over your clothes)",1
Recieved the package and before even opening it I could smell it. The box was not sealed. After following directions to the T(I have been doing straightening systems for over ten years) it did nothing. My hair is still frizzy and just as curly,0

"this Cologne is difficult to find in the local department stores, however it is clean, fresh and doesn't have that ""sweet chemical"" odor that many of the more marketed brands have.  This is truly a unique fragrance.",1
This product is okay...It doesn't smell like apples though! It works like it says it does!,1
Just did not work well.  Product was blotchy and uneven.  I would not buy this again.,0
Amazing...I use it twice a day . Has made skin more even and lightened hyper-pigmentation and most importantly controls OIL production. Will always repurchase,1
Bought this curling iron at the recommendation from my hairdresser due to my thick hair.  It is awesome.  Gets very hot and makes creating curls and waves a breeze.  Can't beat the price either!,1
"I was trying to re-order A previous shimmer product that was more gold in tone.  I think it may be discontinued, because all I found now was this rose-gold one.  I liked the regular gold better - but it's ok.  It doesn't seem as shimmering as the true gold one.  Ah, well.",1

Absolutely love it on my naturally curly hair!,1
Leaves hair too stiff,0
"This is one of the better smelling products. As mentioned in other reviews I am not a fan of the scent of the American Crew Fiber. I have tried the dove sculpting paste, got2b wax and shiner gold clay. This and the shiner gold are the best smelling. This stuff goes in a little tuff, almost like a wax it tugs on the hair a little even when warming it between the hands but it washes out easily and doesn't leave that sticky wax residue afterwards.

I am not particularly fond of the high shine, I prefer the low shine look so I am going to try the fiber pomade or clay of Reuzel in the near future.",1
"I was very excited about the reviews and I like to buy the same line and follow the manufacturer`s instructions, so I bought the shampoo, the conditioner and the leave in. I used them all and my hair is sticky and without movement. I did not approve the purchase, but I will try one more time to make sure I still have to keep trying to find the best products for my curly-fine hair.",0
"I'd give it 0 stars if I could this is worse then cheap men's Gillette shaving cream. Did not even notice an orange smell and it dispensed into a thick shaving cream like lather not a luxurious Spa brand light and airy foam, all I smelled was the chemical propellant that releases it out of the bottle . It didn't even work well to shave my legs , I still feel dirty and it was drying to my skin as well as giving my legs major razor burn .it was so bad I even emailed the company. Save your 15 bucks and spend the 1.99 instead on drugstore brand shaving cream . That's all this is.",0
"Loved that it's the color as said,  says on but easy to wash off,  very easy to apply,  I'll will be buying this product AGAIN.",1
Amazing conditioner!  Made a huge difference in my hair.,1
Amazing product ...,1
"Privet Bloom's notes sound lovely, but it has an incredible biting sharpness I can't identify. It's neither galbanum nor citrus, and it has a very synthetic feeling to it. It has excellent longevity on me, being still noticeable on my skin 16 hours later! In this case, the longevity is a minus, alas. I've read some good reviews of it, so would suggest trying before buying a bottle so you can know whether it's good on you.",0
"Great color and long lasting.  My manicure lasted 6 days with no chipping.  Looks awesome alone or with the black, silver, or white shatter polishes.  Got lots of compliments on this one.",1
"Felt really good while on but did not notice any difference in the appearance of my skin at all.  Disappointing, but there is no such thing as a quick fix for age.",0
Nice color - but didn't last as long as I thought.  Thank you.,1
"This review is for the Beige color variety that is been seen to be combined with 11 more different types of Full Coverage Foundation Makeup Amazon shipped the product promptly and arrived safely. It was tested and I am pleased to report that my daughter likes it. The color was as expected, it was easy to apply and one application lasts the whole day. This product did not cause any skin irritation. The Full Coverage Foundation Makeup also includes a mirror and the plastic is sturdy and does not break easily. Rating with four stars!",1
These are very nice rollers and they were offered at s great price. I have shoulder length hair and they do a great job curling and yet leave the hair healthy looking and shiny.,1
Works perfect for me,1
"I really like this liquid foundation. It goes on well, it feels nice on my face, it smooths evenly, I think it looks good.
I didn't break out after using it either, as is often the case with new makeup.

The only problem I had with this is figuring out what color Im supposed to get. I typically get the 2nd-to-lightest color in a foundation spectrum. This one, Sand, is a 3, but Im not sure if that is 3rd lightest or 3rd darkest. (Their 1 is ivory so maybe 3rd lightest? But then their 5 looks lighter than the sand but then the large color swatches all look the same to me)
The color of the container is MUCH lighter than the actual liquid, which is more like yeah, sand. However, it looks darker when it comes out, its a bit lighter than that when you actually put it on. It works for me, as long as I blend into my hairline and my neck well, but I would have been better off with a lighter shade.",1
My son gave me some for my birthday and I love it. I won't use anything else on my beard!!,1
"My skin fluctuates from fair/cool undertones to tan/warm ones depending on if I tan (makeup is a nightmare). Pale or tan, this product gives a nice, natural, subtle tan. It goes on semi-transparent, not too heavy or opaque, and is easy to build on.",1
Ive been trying to like this product but it doesn't seem to be doing anything for my skin. I use it twice a week and have been for three months. I doesn't seem to make a difference in fact I keep getting little pimples when I do use it! So I feel I have given it a fair chance. It probably works great for others but not for me. I am 36 years old with fair skin. I just had a baby so maybe my skin is just hormonally messed up anyway!,0
It's OK,1
"I love T3 products, and these are good rollers. However, they are really too heavy to be contained by the included clips, and they get so hot hey burn the scalp. I have to put pieces of foam rubber under each. A lighter roller would be better with a better clip.",1
"Joan Collins was quoted a long time ago saying ""I wouldn't live without my Cellux serum"".  it does wonders, especially for scars.",1
This did not work for me.,0
This leave in leaves the worst texture to your hair. If you have any level of bleach or lightening do not use this product.,0
"I've tried most of the mascara brands at Sephora, plus several from the drugstore and department stores (30+ years of mascara and counting). The best I've found that works for me is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Benefit-They-re-Real-Mascara/dp/B00C89Z5KG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Benefit They're Real Mascara</a>, for the lengthening and volumizing of my lashes, plus no flaking/smudging/clumping and relative ease of removal. This mascara compares well, with a couple of caveats.

Pros:
- Lengthens well with one coat
- Doesn't smudge or flake on me
- Removes easily with cleanser and water, no harsh rubbing required
- Easy to get color down to the base of lashes (some fuller brushes make this harder and/or messier)
- Doesn't irritate my eyes at all

Cons
- Doesn't add volume. If you're looking for fuller lashes (not just longer), this may not be the right mascara. The bristles are really short, so application gets most of the color on the front of the lashes (plus the backs if I bother with that side). The sides of the lashes get almost nothing (see photo comparing this wand with Benefit's wand).
- It clumps on me. I guess because of the super-short bristles, the applicator ends up clumping color at times, even with just one coat. I wish it separated lashes better.

Overall, this is a good mascara for length, not so good for fullness (unless you count clumps!).",1
"The bottle of ""Nioxin"" that I received was very different than what I have received in the past.  It had a gold top (the photo had a bronze top) and said it was for treated hair where this shampoo started dying my hair lighter from the first applcation.  The shampoo itself also looked different - not as blue and more runny.  I had read reviews before I bought my first order that there was an alternate or imitation Nioxin being sold and to only get the bronze cap bottles.  So, I made sure that the photo and bottle looked correct when I reordered.  Alas, the product that arrived was very different and did not match my first order.",0
"This stuff Is pretty great. Smells Amazing.

Pros- the Hold isn't crunchy.
Woman Literally Drag my head down so they can smell my head. They seem to love this stuff.
Doesn't destroy my hair after I have used it.

Cons- Only holds for about 4-5 Hours. (Disclaimer: My hair generally has problems with products holding for longer than this. )",1
Love it.,1
"First, be aware that this bottle is TINY. I was picturing a normal-sized product bottle, but for one Alexander Hamilton you are buying a trial-size bottle. Second, for me at least (normal to fine hair, shoulder-length, slight wave, wash every other day), this does not work any better than the Suave brand dry shampoo that costs three bucks for six ounces. That's more than 40 times the price. Wow. Works OK, not great.",0
"Medium coverage formula. Made for sensitive, intolerant, allergy-prone skin. One ounce lasts a really long time. I have gotten away from brushless direct application foundation and enjoyed using this product at home. Instructions are to use after applying a facial moisturizer, SPF, and concealer, while i use the foundation then the concealer.

l'oral-answers/the-question-of-animal-testing: La Roche-Posay/L'Oral themselves do not test on animals anywhere in the world, nor does it delegate the task to others.  L'Oreal does sell  products to China, which may or may not test any given product on animals.",1
"I have been using the Shea butter milk scent bar soap from loccitane for years. I just opened my latest batch purchased from Amazon and the bars are tan in color and do not smell the same at all. Very disappointed in the change and will not be purchasing again, at least from a third party. Hopefully the bars from the actual Loccitane store are still the same white and clean smelling bars I have always purchased.",0
LOVE this color!,1
"While id love to actually review this product and not cheap... i was so excited to receive it, took it out of the box and saw it had a plastic square stand, thinking it was part of the packaging to keep the bottle upright, i went to pull it off and the bottle broke in my hand and product went everywhere. So i cant actually review the product but the packaging is awful. If the plastic stand that was attached is actual packaging, its stuck and the force caused the bottle to break, if its not part of packaging then ya may want to redesign the bottle and omit tht square base",0
"Bought this for my boyfriend since he's a royal soap snob (and is obsessed with the L'Occitane Bar soap). It has a cedar, woodsy smell that I'm sure isn't for everyone, but he absolutely loves. Will be buying again!",1
"I can't give half a star.
My Mum used it for years and it was like a drug. (she is ninty).
But with the new flavour and consistence - she is very unhappy.
Before it bright up her life a bit, but now it smells like a dry flower.
Sorry - I will not buy it for her anymore.",0
"I know this product and love it--this is a great price, so I thought I'd give it a try from Amazon. First time I purchased on Amazon was in January 2015-using that bottle now and the cleanser is very watered down.  I'm using it, but not happy with the consistency at all.  I just purchased another bottle this month, and tried it-it seems nice and thick, like I am used to.  Guess I just got a bad batch the first time.",0
"pretty color but it chips so quickly & easily... and they won't let me return it, even with Amazon Prime?",0
I used to buy this shampoo in the 90s. It had a distinctive good smell. I opened the bottle of this stuff and it doesn't smell the same. It seems really thin too. I'm scared of trying this fake on my hair. Other reviewers also note how the product is not the same.,0
Love it,1
I was trying to find something less expensive than Kinerase for my face. In the first couple of weeks this looked like it would do the trick.  About the third week my face started breaking out and I just couldn't get it to clear up.  I stopped and went back to Kinerase and sure enough within 3 weeks my face was back to clear.  While this may be a good product I definitely cannot use it on my face.,0
I usually don't write reviews but I feel like I have to warn you all that this eyeliner will dry up in about a week and a become a super watery grey mess.,0
It takes up to 4 weeks for results to show. I have only been using it for 1 week so far.,0
I love the product,1
I like the mascara and the color but it does dry up quickly.,1
Crappy. Mine broke or something...it would never gather the powder at the end and was a waste unfortunately.,0
"I tried the Molton Brown Re-Charge Black Pepper stick before settling on this one. It smells like clean linen air fresheners and I'm ok with that. I'm not a particularly sweaty guy but I will have armpit sweat on my shirt if it's hot outside and I'm moving a lot. Honestly the Molton Brown performs better as an antiperspirant, but the smell of this one is a lot less controversial. This does not irritate my skin and it lasts longer and performs better than the drug store brands.",1
"I received my product yesterday and must say I am deeply disappointed. The product arrived hard as a rock even though it's suppose to be a creamy texture. I have a teal liner I am still using after 2 years and it is still soft and creamy because I cover these things including mascaras. I simply need to get a good creamy teal/green liner before my current one is finish. For the cost, the shipped product should have been conducive to my needs. This is soooo wrong on all levels!! Never again!",0
"I liked the scent and simple ingredient list of this conditioner, but found it to leave my hair dull without enough moisture. I expected better results for the price. Will not purchase again.",0
"I really, really like this product, and hope they never discontinue it.  I have an aversion to saying I ""Love"" something like this, or I would give it 5 stars. This works, and if you don't inspect me too closely, makes me look younger by keeping the lipstick where it belongs.  It takes a VERY small amount to work, and it lasts most of the day.  By the time my lipstick no longer looks good, I'm back at home having a pre-dinner adult beverage.",1
"This light, water-based gel tint is one of my favorites. It's great for those days when I don't want a full coverage lipstick, but still want some color. What I love is how buildable the color is. My lips are naturally dark so the red just looks like a deep cherry stain. And yes, it is a stain. Apply the first coat and let dry for two to five minutes for staying power. After that, I apply either a gloss or balm and I'm set for the day. I love this stuff. Oh, and it makes a great base for lipstick as well.",1
"Wasn't what I expected. If you put it directly on your hair... It dumps into one spot causing clumps, and if you try to sprinkle it around... Too much product. Most recommended way is to sprinkle into your hand and emulsify it with both hands, and then applying. Defeats the whole purpose, might as well get a regular cream or paste. I was excited but was let down. Great idea, practical it is not.",0
"In just two weeks of use, I've noticed a significant difference in the new sunspots that have accumulated on my face over the summer. The serum goes on smooth and absorbs quickly, so there's no messy or sticky feeling, just smooth clean skin under it. Also I was glad to see I had no eye irritation with this as I've had with some other products. One thing I do have to say though is that sunscreen with this is an absolute must. The first day I used it and went outside without sunscreen, my face felt very sensitive and tingly but the next day when I did apply sunscreen, I had no such issues. Will continue to use it and see how it improves my older spots.",1
"I sprayed this perfume, smelled water down. Disappointed",0
I LIKE IT,1
first time I went to use this conditioner it slipped out of my hand and the top broke off. I think better design would eliminate that. I am not sure if it will help my old fried hair or not but will come back to report on that.,0
Great color.,1
Excelente,1
Will not turn on. Do not purchase from this seller.,0
The product does not strengthen nails. Do not spend money,0
The cap is broken. The bottle has dents.,0
I use this everyday! Price is a little expensive but its worth it plus is smells reallllllyyyy good. You really only need to use a little of it to make your hair look wild... in a good way!,1
"Really disappointed in this product. It managed to make my hair dry and greasy at the same time. I have fine thin hair and have tried many salt sprays out there. My favorite is the Davines one, followed by the Bumble and Bumble, but I thought I'd check this one out because I'd heard good things about it. While the packaging is nice and the spray provides an even mist, I did not get the same beachy texture that I've gotten from other sprays. It just left my hair flat and limp. The smell is also as bad as some of the other reviews mention. This may be a better option for people with thicker hair who don't mind strong fragrance in their hair products.",0
"Great cleansing. Face feels smoother. Makeup goes on more evenly. Comfortable vibrations relieve tension and are soothing. Easy to use.. like the different ""zones"" and intensities.",1
"My hairdresser uses this and I love it there, but  for some reason this seemed much stronger and too minty. It was not as soothing as the one I've used before. I returned it.",0
"St. Tropez is a much better product. This one has a more orange hue, and doesn't last nearly as long...except on all the wrong places(ankles/knees/etc)",0
"I have been using gel polish for a few months, but went to a new salon. After, I was desperate after a week of pain from a nail salon that drilled the top of my nails and then added a tip overlay, covered it with acrylic (pink and white powder and chemical) and topped it all off with gel polish. It was thick, and it was painful. I just wanted them off. I didn't want to deal with the salon, but in the end, that's where I should have gone. Instead, I bought these foil wrappers, extra strength lacquer polish remover, and they did very little! How can so many reviewers claim that it removes gel polish and acrylic nails????

I researched how to remove gel polish and acrylic nails, ordered Expert Touch Removal Wraps and Opi Expert Touch Lacquer Remover 4 oz from Amazon, and thought I would get this done quickly and without further harm to my nails.

Last night, I wrapped my nails in Extra strength lacquer polish remover with cotton soaked in the remover and then the foil wrap pads for an hour. MOST of the gel polish could then be scraped off with an orange stick, but not all - and certainly not the acrylic stuff underneath. By doing internet research, I understand this is called solar nails or pink and white powder. This has to be the worst stuff for your hands!

Today, I tried another hour with remover and foil wrap pads but only managed to soften one big nail and get part of the fake stuff off. By then my hands felt so damaged. So I went to a nearby salon  and asked - just take everything off, don't DRILL anything, don't PULL anything, just be gentle. After an hour of soaking in acetone warmed by warm water, and her alternately taking out one hand and gently using an emery board to get gently file off the acrylic crap - she had to do this multiple times because once the fingernail comes out of the acetone, whatever is on it begins hardening again and the nails had to go back in the acetone. Finally, it was all off and she put on the cuticle oil. The salon had a lady who could understand and speak English and she did the removal. She said, don't do anything to your nails for a month, they are very very weak now. NOTE, she did have to use the drill GENTLY to get off the remaining gel polish which hadn't come off but was very near the edge of my nails.

Because of the 2 hrs at home with nail polish remover and 1 hr at the salon with acetone, my hands and nails were very very dry. I came home and put olive oil on them but still the nails themselves feel dry. That's better than having them turn to mush if I had left that acrylic crap on any longer than a week.  The original reason I got the gel nails was because my nail had cracked all the way down past the white of the nail top and I was in severe pain. I met a cosmetologist who said don't use artificial nails NOTHING. She recommended a fiber nail polish and hardener, and even with that, to remove it every 2 weeks so my nails can breath.

To get it removed professionally cost me $10 plus $1 tip. I paid $3.24 for the Expert Touch Removal Wraps and $5.86 for the Opi Expert Touch Lacquer Remover 4 oz.  The salon was the better value! Sometimes you just can't do it yourself!

I want nail salons to have people who speak and understand English, and who do what the client asked. All I asked was for overlay tips and gel polish - not this solar nail crap!",0
this product works okay. might keep buying it until i find another brand.,1
"The smell of this dryer was horrible! My bathroom cabinet smelled like a tire store, yuck!. After 2 weeks and the smell didn't go away I sent it back.  The dryer was also a bit heavy, but its the first ceramic one I have ever purchased & don't know if that is normal with ceramic dryers",0
"Very nice!  I have shoulder-length fine hair that gets dried out in the winter.  Just one use of this conditioning mask left my hair moisturized and bouncy, with a pleasant scent.  The scent is almost fruity, but not quite -- but it's a light scent and not perfumey at all.  I plan to use this at least once a week, maybe twice, to keep my hair looking nice.",1
"I don't recommend this shampoo and conditioner.  It leaves my hair feeling like its got a weird residue on it, and makes my scalp itch.  I bought it hoping that it would compliment the effects I get from the deepshine phyto marine lusterizer, of which I'm a big fan, but was sadly disappointed.  My hair looked dull and flat.",0
I ordered this for a friend and she wasn't satisfied (yes the thirteen year olds can have fun with that sentence).  It doesn't adhere to her nails and peels off too easily.,0
"Everyone needs this color in their stash, it's a staple color.",1
This is the best CC cream that I have ever used and I have tried them all!. I get compliments all the time about how great my skin looks. Just the right amount of coverage and it blends perfectly.,1
"Easy to put on, I recommend the buying the mit. Got a little blotchy in some areas that could of easily been my fault.",1
Very conditioning,1
Anyone that pays $36 for for this 4 oz product is being robbed.,0
I saw this item in Essence Magazine and just had to have it.  Boy was I disappointed.  It doesn't match the color of my eyebrows and the filler stuff flakes off almost as soon as you put it on.  Don't buy this.  Stick to your trusty eyebrow pencils!,0
This foundation did not work for my skin at all. It broke up all around my face even after following the instructions perfectly.,0
I'm a fan of Hot Tools products but this one kind of let me down a bit. There was a slight flaw on the metal part of the barrel from manufacturing so it has a small bump (almost as if a piece of metal stuck to it during the gold painting process). It doesn't seem to snag hair but just looks a little cheap because of it. Other than that I was really pleased to see it came with two extra clamp springs. The reason I bought this was my old one had a broken clamp spring so this was a real bonus!,1
Item came Quick and on time for a Christmas gift for someone special. She loved the surprise and the fragrance.,1
"It smells good, goes on easily and one pump is enough for my shoulder-length hair. When I use the flat iron, my hair turns out beautifully straight, shiny and I'm confident the product is protecting it from the heat.",1
"This is a great portable product. The best color is the rose gold in the center. It is buttery smooth and applies easily. All three shades are good, though. You can easily do a complete eye look with just this palette. The one that looks so yellow in the picture is more of a cream shade and is good for the brow bone. The dark is great for the crease. I found these mattes to be easier to work with than the mattes in the new LORAC palette.

There is no applicator with this, so if you want to throw it in your bag for a trip, know that you will have to take a brush. I always apply over a primer, and it lasts all day.",1
An under-eye sunblock that doesn't make my sensitive eyes water! Yes!,1
"First, let me say this rating is from a purchase at another store. This order was marked delivered, but was not and arrived 2 days later, box opened and re-sealed. The Zirh lotion had been opened and used, so I returned the order. Also, it had a different color and smell from his original cream.

My son has used the Zirh Rejuvenating cream for about 6 months and feels it is a very good moisturizer and formulated for men. It soaks into the skin and moisturizes very nicely. It is not greasy and has a very light scent.",1
"I know they said mini.. but good lord.. this looks like something for a kids toy. It only has one setting, on/off. It does heat my wigs that well at all. After reading all the reviews i was very disappointed with this product.",0
"I was so anxious to receive this product. It had been years since I had been able to afford to treat myself to such an indulgence fragrance. I was shocked to see how large the bottle was for the price. I never expected it to be that large. It will last me a long time. I love the scent it reminds me of better times and being rich. Even if o.nly for a moment I can recall ths smell of abundance, its soooo sexy",1
This along with the serum works wonders. My wife's lashes look done up even without the mascara now and with the mascara they really pop.,1
I have natural wavy and course hair and this product does a very good job of cleaning my scalp while taming my hair.,1
ordered wig,0
Not bad but I have better product.,1
Love this stuff! So light and doesn't weigh your hair down! Just be careful not to spray so much or else it will get a bit sticky. Smells great!,1
Love the smell and the effect. This is such a great product line. Not easy to find but worth the hunt. I definitely recommend this scrub.,1
Arrived open with shampoo all over bottle...,0
I picked this up for the first time in Sephora. It worked so well I've been using it ever since. It's not sticky and it lasts a long time. I'm very pleased that saleswoman pointed me towards this product because I would never have found it otherwise.,1
"This is light weight wear every day moisturizer.  It goes on smooth and you can wear it alone or under makeup.  Its light scent fades quickly and is not offensive. This is a great product but there are a few down sides as well. The price, $10 for only .5 oz. It is actually more cost effective to by 4 of these tubes for $40 and get 2 full ounces then by the larger 1.7oz tub for $42. Also it suggest using a dime size amount, so you use a lot of it quickly if using it daily. And for some it might matter that it does not have an SPF so you would need to use something that did.",1
"I found that the clips do not hold securely and the curlers are so heavy that it is hard to get certain ones to stay.  When I can get them to stay, they curl just fine, and it heats up quickly.",0
"EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!! I had a hair transplant May 16, 2014 and this product adds a great deal of thickness to the fine hairs in my bald spot, all of the hairs look as if  they are coming out of my scalp.  Absolutely, nobody knows my secret :-)",1
I think the product may be past its date. Seems clumpy and odd when I opened the lid.,0
"This did not work for me, at all.  It irritated the rims of my eyes, made my eyes burn, and made my eyelids red, even though used as directed.  I figured I would try it on my eyebrows rather than throwing it away.  It even irritated the skin beneath my eyebrows!!  The skin felt irritated, turned pink and dry, then became scaly.  I am not THAT sensitive, so I can't understand why there are not a LOT more reviews saying that this product is causing a lot of burning, redness and irritation.  Done with this!",0
I've been using this product for 40 years!! They've changed the formula and now it is much thinner than it used to be!! Very disappointed and will not be buying it again!!,0
"Love the product, smell and makes my hair luminous. I have fine, wavy processed hair and does not leave my hair greasy at all.",1
I love solar oil.,1
"I bought this based on the great reviews and a friend's recommendation. It made my skin breakout, even on my cheeks where i never had any acne.",0
The ingredients in the picture don't match those on the bottle which didn't work for me because of allergies to The ingredients,0
"I used to wear Josie back in the mid 90's; Avon used to sell it.  I absolutely loved it!...but what happens when we love something????  They discontinue it.  A few years later I found a bottle on Ebay, and it still had the same effect; beautiful, soft fragrance.  After that, it was nowhere to be found.  I discovered this by sheer accident recently and had to buy it...I was so excited. It's difficult being sensitive to scents...I can't wear just anything.  It comes with a cute little pouch that has a little elastic holder inside.  The pouch is big enough to put other cosmetics in; even a cellphone - and it's a really big bottle.  Because I don't wear perfume that often, it doesnt make sense to buy a huge bottle, this will last me forever.  When it arrived I was like a desperate woman.. I put some on immediately.  First thing I noticed is that you may not want to roll the ball on your wrist (or maybe this is just me) because it distributes A LOT! I just tap it on one wrist and barely.  It doesn't smell like I remember, I was a bit, maybe more than a bit disappointed; but then again, sense of smell changes with age, body chemistry, etc.... but so does manufacturing :(  It's a bit strong, smells almost identical to D&G Lite Blue for men and that's not a bad thing because D&GLB for men smells good on us women.. in fact, it smells better than the womens fragrance.  It's just strong!  When it dissipates a bit it smells really good, but then it seems to wear off altogether or maybe I just get used to it because it's on me... either way, I'm keeping it - it doesn't make me sick...like I said, it's good in VERY small amounts it's just not the Josie it once was.  I probably will not order again... but only for that reason; personal preference.",1
"WARNING! This product is addictive!
The smell is refreshing and makes you want to spray it periodically throughout the day. I put it on first after cleansing the face followed by toner, serums, etc. I feel like it has improved my skin tone - my face just seems brighter when using this product. Try it, you'll love it. Don't waste your money on the little bottle because you'll be sorry you didn't order the big one! Hard to beat the price too!",1
"Goes on easy and stays on.  I have worn up to 10 days before changing.  Only 2 occasions of a minor chip, easily repaired.",1
Awesome product. I have thinning hair and this shampoo helps bring confidence again. Highly recommend.,1
"Convenient toner as you don't need separate cotton balls to apply toner, but is on the pricey side. May be cheaper to get regular toner and use something to apply with.",1
First time shaving with a safety razor. I bought these blades to start off with. Had no problem slicing through a 7 day growth of facial hair. I did not notice any tugging as others have said all seemed smooth and as the wife said smooth as a baby's bottom. Only nick I got was on a mole that resides on my chin. Which even the shaving systems do as well. But the price difference is substantially less,1
"This stuff works pretty well on my curly hair. While the scent is nice, it's a bit overwhelming. Haven't repurchased because of that.",1
"For blonde hair, this didn't work.  I know that the darker color does work because my sister uses it, this one, not so much!",0
Tried this but it does not do a good job cleaning and leads to clogged pores and breakouts. Loreal (youth code foaming gel) makes a great product which is cheaper and cleans much better. I would not recommend this product.,0
The brush vibration is very weak even after a full charge,0
"Until now I still can not use the machine, after examination found open switch, can not produce the laser.",0
Fabulous!!  I've been using it for years.  There is nothing as good as products from the Dead Sea.,1
"I'm normally a fan of the more solid concealers in stick or pot form since I can get heavy controlled coverage with those to hide the deep dark circles I've been getting under my eyes for the last year or two.  This was the first liquid concealer I've tried in a very long time that didn't become virtually translucent after patting it onto the spots I'm trying to hide.  It stayed nice and opaque and even after dabbing my liquid foundation over it, kept a nice bright base.  I was really pleasantly surprised by the results and since it is so smooth and creamy, I don't worry as much about tugging at that delicate under eye area to get coverage.",1
I love this product.  It really smooths out my face and gets rid of the intense acne I had in spots.,1
I don't find that this product gives any relief to my skin.,0
I love this product,1
"I recently ordered (and received) this hair dryer; I tried it out and don't like it AT ALL!! The way the controls are positioned makes no sense at all (the on/off switch is below the heat settings and very un-ergonomical to use!!) and makes using it for styling (where one needs to switch on and off all the time, rather than drying the whole head in one go, for which it would be acceptable) extremely inconvenient; also, the buttons have no grip whatsoever, it's very, very hard to slide them on and off!! As other reviewers have commented, it is quite heavy but that part I could live with - but its inconvenience of use is something I'm not willing to suffer on a daily basis!
Very disappointed and wondering why most people seem to be ok with this?? And did the people who designed this place never actually try it out???
Hoping the seller will take it back without creating problems. WAiting to hear back from them.

Summary: if you're looking for a device to style your hair with, rather than drying the whole lot in one go without having to use the switches, I strongly recommend against this dryer!!",0
This stuff is very dry. It comes out dry almost like clay. I have had to mix it with another cream in order to get a decent consistency to apply to my face. It also dries out my skin.,0
my wife seems to like it but it seems like water in a spray bottle to me. i tried it myself and my face got wet. hmmm....,1
"Haven't tried the mask yet. But when I received it, it is already opened and used definitely.",0
"I have been using this product for over a year , it smoothes out the fine lines under your eyes & eyelids , I love Revision Teamine eye complex ",1
Great quality,1
"I have dry, fine hair that frizzes easily in the summer and was looking for a vegan moisturizing product.  I have been using the Atlantis shampoo with success but this conditioner left my hair heavy and feeling like it had an oily coating. So just after I blowdry my hair it already feels dirty. I'll be returning this product.",0
This is my favorite color. By far. It really sucks that it's a limited edition thing. That makes me sad. I'd buy it again as soon as I'm out if I could find it again. This is the best nail polish brand I've ever used and surpasses OPI and all the others.,1
My son is using this for rather severe acne. I am seeing a difference.  It seems to be quite excellent.,1
"I have previously ordered this item directly from Indie Lee, and the product itself it wonderful, and has worked well in tandem with Indie Lee's Rosehip Cleanser to clear up some skin issues I've had. I decided to order from Amazon this time around so that I could utilize Prime 2-day shipping and get the item faster than ordering it from Indie Lee's website. When the item came in, I opened it and immediately noticed a slight motor oil like odor, which I had never noticed from the bottle I purchased direct from Indie Lee. I still have a little left in my previous bottle, so I compared the two, and wouldn't you know, there is absolutely no odor at all to original bottle, even though it is well over a year and a half old. I mean, I guess it's possible that the bottle I received from Amazon was very aged and had gone rancid, but it actually just kind of smelled like it had been tampered with or cut with something of lesser quality. In either case, I don't want to be putting it on my skin. Refund request is already in process.",0
"I really like the idea and how these work, but they're not durable.  I have tried two of these and neither stood up to use.  I learned from the 1st one (I thought) to not treat it like it's metal and press hard - it doesn't take much to curl - but the 2nd one broke the same way.  :(",0
Does not hold hair well. Curling / straightening iron blades with too big of space. My hair is not fine.,0
"I like its color,like candy,so cute!
And I apply it once a week, it makes my face smooth, and lightened.
Because the volume is too much for me, I give a half to my best friend.
She feels terrific with it, too.",1
Ok volumizer...prefer the thickening mist.,1
I love it! But carefully put it on and you'll look great,1
Love it!!!,1
Does not remove Lacquer.  A waste of money.,0
My manicurist uses this product on my nails. I absolutely love it. It smells wonderful and really works! I get compliments on my nails all the time.,1

My favorite liquid lip. Nude color with a touch of pink for lighter olive-toned skin!,1
Great product.,1
"I've returned the brush because the power cut off as the cord swiveled, so there was only power about half the time.  It's really cheaply made.  The plastic bristles do not grip hair at all, which is a problem for me because my hair is short.  I have fine, thinning  hair and a shortish A-line bob with a lot of layering, and need the brush to straighten and shape (add volume and turn the ends under).  This brush sort of worked as a hot comb, but not much more.  On high heat, the plastic smelled terrible.  I wouldn't want to wrap my hair tightly around such cheap plastic - I would be afraid of damage.  I'm going to try a more expensive brush with a ceramic barrel.  On the plus side, it was easier than my usual struggle with a brush and blow dryer.",0
Do not buy this - I took it to my nail salon & the nail polish would not dry,0
"the first time I used it I notice more volume on my hair. The mint smell can be a bit strong for some people, but I like it.",1
"Like SO MANY others have posted, I also purchased this item 2 months ago. Stopped turning on, won't charge and is rusted inside the head. I called Amazon and explained to them my case and they were happy to send me a return label so I can ship the item back and grant me a full refund. When is this scam artist going to be removed from Amazon?????",0
"This product did not work, at all. I took two capsules, twice a day until I finished the bag completely. My cystic acne and hormonal acne never got better, it got worse at times. I am not sure this is the real product that they ship you because there was no affect. My skin had no reaction at all.",0
"*Sample version* Not enough in there. I have a lot of hair and this was insufficient. I appreciate Amazon's feature of ordering samples and I'm even okay throwing a few bucks at finding the right hair care products, but there should be a minimum amount requirement so samplers can actually decide if the product is right for them. I will not be ordering a larger size because I don't actually know if this product would work in my hair.",0
"Been using since May. Don't see a difference in my skin. Smells nice, goes on easy, but does not l Iive up to the hipe! Disappointed, especially since it is not a cheap product.",0
Didnt work for me. Its overpriced,0
"Didn't work for me. My hair gets really frizzy, especially in the summer humidity. It did not stop the frizz or hold the curl.",0
This is my favorite hand wash to keep in my bathrooms.,1
It's the best for dry skin!,1
"Sooooo disappointed! I had such high hopes! It was great until part of the flat iron SNAPPED OFF mid use! I couldn't believe it. Completely useless now and with no warranty I'm out a lot of money. I spent so much time choosing the exact iron I wanted. Read hundreds of reviews and decided to spend my money here. I know I'm just ranting at this point, but I feel ripped off by the company and an inferior product.",0
I bought this eye pencil. It brakes a lot when I try to use a sharpener. End up with nothing left. Waste of money.,0
"Was very excited to receive this product, but upon the first night of using my skin was darker the following morning.  I continued using for three more days but the results were horrific!!
I will probable use it on my legs and arms as I think the reason for getting darker was because of my sensitive face!",0
very good shave,1
"COUNTERFEIT!
L'Occitane bottle, but a cheap counterfeit product inside - didn't even smell like almonds. Returned and ordered directly from L'Occitane website - no problems there and price was the same.

Hands down this is the best blow dryer you will ever find. It is worth every penny!! I can not believe how easy it is to do my hair and how good it looks. I plan on buying another one to keep at my beach house so that I do not have to cart it back and forth.,1
"I really had high expectations for this product based on the highly rated reviews, but I was very disappointed. Now I will let you know that I am an African American with natural hair (sister locks) and i have noticed my locs aren't as thick as they used to be so I wanted to see how this product would work. Well when I put it on, the color was a bit weird. Though I ordered black it was black greenish gray looking. Weird is all I can say. It kinda reminded of cigarette ashes or something and it just didn't adhere well to my scalp and between my locs. Thankfully, I found this product called Caboki (i think that is the spelling) and it's unbelievable how good this product works! It's amazing!!! I actually thought I would be disappointed with it like I was with the Toppik because usually these products are made for Caucasian type hair, but it worked miracles for my hair. My daughter is a hair stylist and I asked her to look at my hair and tell me if she noticed anything different. She just said my hair seemed thicker. When i showed her what it was I used on my hair, she was impressed. This stuff is literally like fine hair in a can or bottle or whatever the container is....that you can shake on your hair. The best part i found is that when I rub my scalp it doesn't come off and get all in my finger nails. Just an amazing product. Anyhow, in my opinion Toppik isn't the product for Ethnic (or at least natural ethnic) hair. I don't work for the Caboki company, but I wouldn't mind investing in the company because i will definitely be buying more of that particular product so I gave Toppik two stars because I would not have found that product on youtube had I not been searching for Toppik.",0
"I hate anything beauty related. I do it, but I'm always on the lookout for more efficient ways. For example, I have full makeup (with color correction and dramatic eyes) down to under 5 minutes. This extends to everything else, like hair and nails. I won't stop, but the less time I have to spend on it, the better. I read the reviews on this and got the impression that it would last a while, which is exactly what I needed. The verdict is now in: from the time of my first 2-layer application to the first chip, this polish lasted a solid 10 days. From the time I first applied it to the time it was so chipped I needed to remove the rest and re-apply was 15 days. Even then, 5 nails were in near-perfect condition. That's respectable.

Keep in mind that I don't do much strenuous with my hands that may otherwise affect this outcome. It works for me, though. It's not as long as I'd like, but I don't think any polish short of a tattoo would last as long as I'd like.",1
"I experienced extreme amounts of hair loss and an itchy scalp. I thought maybe I was just stressed out, then my head just kept getting itchy. It got so bad, I thought I had lice. After further research, it turns out that I am not the only one. Pureology contains Linalool and Limonene. They are used to mask fragrances and are used in insecticides and insect repellents. They are also known skin irritants. My acne also returned which I thought was odd. Not everyone reacts to these ingredients, but I wanted to put it out there in case anyone else has the same problem. I generally liked this product as it kept my hair from fading and cut back on the frizz... such a shame.",0
not worth the buy... its ok. but it makes my hair greasy i don't see any glass affect. just makes it gross def disapointed in the brand for this. i have used garnier products that work better.,0
"Although my wife was excited to try this product, she was disappointed upon opening the package.  The bottle was slightly open and half of the liquid fell out into the zip lock bag it was in and spilled out.",0
"Wow, this stuff is amazing! It has lasted SO much longer than I thought, almost a year. I use it every night before bed. Lots of other lip products dry my lips out but this is very nourishing and moisturizing.",1
"I can't stand the smell. It smells like cheap men's cologne and the smell does not go away. I had to wash the stuff off it was so bad. Granted, I am particular about scents and try to buy scent free whenever I can. I did smell this at a spa where I had a facial and they used this product line. I didn't think it smelled like this at the spa so I don't know if my senses were overwhelmed at the spa and I couldn't smell it right or if the batch I received is over scented or if this is not genuine. I cannot use it. Other than the smell it is probably fine. The consistency and absorption seemed good and I like the higher SPF level for a facial sunscreen.",0
"This Jouer creme eyeshadow was in my LeMatch box, and I was excited. But, much like their eyeshadow creme crayon it quickly turned to utter disappointment.
It's easy to apply, soft, and the shades are lovely. But, there is zero staying power. None. I have normal eyes, and no matter what primer, moisturizer, lack of moisturizer, I did, this would not stay on for more than about 10 minuets.
The only reason this is slightly better than the creme eyeshadow stick is that it didn't completely end up in my crease.
It didn't feel right, never dried, and for the price I expected so much better.",0
"I used this product for one month.  I thought if I kept using it that maybe it would eventually work.  It made my skin old looking.  I stopped using Strivectin.  Now I am using a cheap creme and my face is back to normal.

"I was extremely excited to finally receive this when it came to me in the mail. You should have been in my head to understand the excitement I felt reading all the amazing reviews, a new hairdo; a new outlook on life! Before my hair had sideswept bangs and one day I decided to part it with a more texturized elevated top. That day I did all my research on the best products for thick long-ish hair. Most of the sites I came up swore by this product and American Crew Fiber.

This product smells like licorice and looks like glue stick in my hair. I though it was maybe me or maybe it was something in the elements but no. Before this product arrived in the mail I went to Wal-Mart to try out American Crew Fiber and was stunned when my hair stayed up, parted and texturized THE WHOLE DAY. I was thinking whoah, I can only imagine what Baxters will do. Well it did nothing but cause me stress because I really wanted it to work on me. I wanted to believe the beautiful glass jar full of nutrients and licorice smell but nothing. My hair more or less looked dull and flat and I tried every combination to see what I could do. Damp with blowdryer, dry with fingers, dry with palms, using more of it and nothing it all looked the same. Not to mention it did not ""clump"" my hair into a texturized mold. Instead it look like a bunch of fly-aways hairs made up my scalp. I honestly can not recommend this product but MAYBE it will work for YOU. For the price and lack of reviews (yes 3 or 4 reviews sprinkled here and there should have warned me) I would go and just buy/try American Crew Fiber.

My hair looked dull for a while and I had not seen that beautiful dark brown color I once had and with two uses of American Crew Fiber it came back. It looked like I had a new weave in my hair and not to mention the fact of it's strong hold and texturizing paste like qualities without looking like I had anything in my hair.

My hair type is 3 inches on the top, thick not coarse black hair.

* Note: I spent double my money having to replace this product",0
perfect color,1
"The scent just doesn't work for me. I'd describe it like this: Take a pan of freshly prepared caramel, drizzle on a large helping of imitation vanilla, and then spritz with dollar store musk cologne. It doesn't smell very bad, but as others have noted, it does end up smelling like a cheap candle- one of those bath store candles aimed at women with a name like ""Summer Mood"" that doesn't actually describe any known smell in the universe.

So what you get is a container of mostly oversweet vanilla with undertones of cheap ""manly"" smells. If this was merely the first draft, as though these really were alcohol distillers and the first batch came out badly, then I'd say it has promise. As is I think this product is probably stuck where it is, so I'm not impressed.

The bath soap lathers just fine, but does NOT rinse well. The smell and an oily sensation clung to my body to the point that I wasn't sure when I would be done rinsing. So again, it feels cheap.

If this was something you could pick up at a dollar store, it might be a neat ""masculine"" gift. As it's not something I'd recommend unless you're buying it for the Axe crowd who aren't very discerning with scents to begin with. It certainly doesn't live up to its packaging.",0
Good stuff,1
After a few uses the sprayer got clogged.  Tried to clean (fix) and it did not work.,0
Broke after a few months,0
I love this curling iron. I only have to use the lowest setting and it makes a really nice curl that holds all day. I just use it as a wand and wrap my hair around the barrel and the clamp. It's super easy to use and works really well.,1
"After using the product a total of 5 times the color sensor has decided my sun deprived, padty white legs are too dark and will no longer work.  I am trying to decide between returning and trying a replacement or giving up and looking for a different product.

I have very fine hair and it is difficult to find a hairspray the holds my hair without being sticky but this spray does the trick (as much as possible!) yes it is pricey but it does work.,1
does nothing,0
I use this product as part of my everyday skin regimen. The best effect of the product is on the texture of my skin and the blackheads and whiteheads. It significantly reduces my whiteheads and blackheads leaving my skin extremely smooth. This product also diminishes my pores. I get great compliments on the smoothness and softness of my skin since using this product.,1
My hair dresser told me I don't ever need to worry about using to much of this product on my hair however in my first use I used just about two pumps and my hair was greasy and difficult to style. Might be doing something wrong on my end but this product wasn't as great as I was hoping it would be.,0
Was really wishing this would work even a little but didn't see an any kind of difference. Felt a little tingling and hope that meant it was working some magic but I was let down.,0
What moron spends 42 dollars on conditioner??? It's literally no different that the 2-3 doller crap!,0
I was surprised to receive RED nailpolish. This picture is deceiving. I was expecting a pink color. It shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate.,0
such a big one,1
"Great professional iron, gets very hot and makes beautiful curls! Definitely recommend purchasing one!!",1
"A few disclaimers:
1) no cream can cure aging
2) no cream can cure a wild night of partying or a bad lifestyle
3) If you have really bad bags under your eyes, you could have a sinus infection, see your doctor

Those things said, this cream is fantastic.  It has a cooling effect under the eye which does decrease puffiness.  There are a few things that I really like about this cream:
- it's odorless
- it's white but it goes on clear
- I can feel the coolness on my eyes

Overall, I'm very careful with what products I put around my eyes. Once I got a terrible puffy eye from putting regular lotion around my eye and I had to go to the doctor. Only put products you really trust around your eye and use only as directed.

I do trust Baxter in a product like this and it does help with puffiness & color.",1
Best face wash ever,1
Perfect nude color.  Goes on smoothly.  Dries pretty quickly.  Protects and lasts well.,1
"I would not recommend this product as a gel or paste-type styling agent. Hold is very poor. It also makes hair look shiny/greasy if used in moderate amounts. I mainly use it around the back and sides of my head to keep frizz/cowlick down. For any other use that involves styling and hold, I would recommend another product like Texture Dirt, which has much better hold and is much less visible in hair.",0
Please be carful. I used a product before with 8% glycolic acid about one a week and it was awesome. I bought this one thinking my skin could handle the higher concentration. I broke out with a terrible rash all over my face and neck. Im returning it and buying one that is not as intense.,0
"Works very well. A bit of a funky smell (which they market as lavender, but it's unlike any lavender I've ever smelled). Though that is the only negative. My skin has been insanely more moisturized and softer since using it.",1
"Expensive.

But I'm a sucker for the scale tingle, and the fragrant is nice. The tingle is stronger than others I've tried, and it last longer once you rinse it out.

The trick to twisting the pump! Another review mention using a pair of pliers. It is a good tip, but extreme. The trick is to tighten the cap down good. The inside lip will squeeze the pump mechanism. Once its on tight, just twist the pump head. Done. No need for pliers.",1

"I am not talented with curling irons. I have watched many YouTube tutorials and tried to imitate curls using hair irons, curling irons, and wands. This product truly made it easy for me to get the curled look. I love that it rotates my hair and that I can choose the direction. There are left/right buttons,speed control (fast/slow) for the rotation, heat control buttons, and an off and on switch. The only reason it got four stars is because the price is a little hefty but if you have a little extra to splurge and you struggle with regular irons, I would recommend purchasing.",1
"I shave alot. I shave my head every other day and I like the idea of using a pre-shave oil to help avoid irritation. I have used Kinexium from King of Shaves in the past and it is great other than the smell. The Art of Shaving Sandalwood Pre-Shave oil doesn't smell like sandalwood (unlike their Sandalwood AfterShave Balm, which smells good). It smells more like the carrier oils that are used. It is also way too sticky to the touch and it is very viscous. It will clog your razor in a pass or two and you have to work to get rid of the hair in between the razors. I threw it out.",0
"Love the name!  the color is a deep purple, but not as close to black as I thought it would be.",1
With long and thick hair it is hard to find a tool that actually provides the right waves and curls. Most curling irons don't heat up enough or only last a few uses before they have a short and no longer work. I have owned three different Hot Tools curling irons and they have lasted me quite a lot uses. I use this curling on my hair daily and achieve the right curls without having to use any product in my hair. It is great that it has a heat setting so that you can control the heat output. Most curling irons only have one setting although it claims to be multiple. Recommend this for anyone looking for the right curl.,1
"I was recommended this since I have oily skin but it did nothing for my face. My acne was still present even after two weeks of use. Normally it takes a product a month for my skin to get used to, but this product never showed any improvement. I have found something that works for my skin now though. It did smell nice and had a smooth application. I won't discourage anyone from buying this because everyone's skin is different. Just make sure you do your research on like the right product for your skin type.",0
"Haven't had the chance to use it, but I love the little box it comes in and the smell is heaven!",1

"This item did nothing for my hair.  It was a complete waste of money.  No shine, no nothing. I definitely would try another brand. I can't give up.",0
Just so so for me - I used this during my Kilimanjaro hike! I find it did not clean my hair very well. Probably will not repurchase in future.,0
"It's been 5 months and not a single hair has grown that wasn't my own before I bought this item.  I have doubted other reviews mostly by people selling the product used suggesting that they just gave up after a month or two of use. I have use this religiously for five months now, and although the manufacturer says six months of use is recommended, i've use this as directed and without any results. I'm not bald I simply have thinning hair in the front and would be considered a perfect candidate for this product.  I'll change my review if for some miraculous reason new hair, allegedly up to some 30 follicles per square inch, happen to appear!",0
"I am 42 years old and get compliments often when I reveal my age.  I am told people think I'm in my early 30's.  I use this eye Serum morning and night, concentrated under my eyes, and also on entire face.  Before it dries I apply Korres wild rose lotion on top.  I have sensitive skin and many products give me acne.  This does NOT.  It also goes on silky smooth and leaves my skin feeling dewy.  It helps minimize fine lines and hydrates all day without making my face look oily.  I also use make up, and my make up does not ball up when applied.  It goes on smoothly and helps it look more natural.  I have used this for years now and it is worth every penny.  I don't go anywhere without it and believe it is my secret weapon to fending off wrinkles.  I also have my husband using it and he has noticed results as well.",1
"I have fine, straight hair, but it's also thick. I was hoping this powder would help give my hair some body and lift so it doesn't look quite so flat. It worked a little bit right after a haircut when my hair was fairly short, but after about two weeks of growth, the powder seemed totally ineffective. I have tried different amounts of powder, and different levels of hair dryness, but just isn't working for me. I love their hairspray, but disappointed in this powder.",0
Made me break out.,0
"THank you the shipping was excellent, the directions easy to follow and here we go to see if the blonde, black, and brown will all come out of my hair!!!! yay THANKS",1
"This product really dried my skin out. I was hoping that I would see some positive change in my skin with this product, but unfortunately that didn't happen. It may just be my dry/ sensitive skin... I gave it to my Mom to try to see if it works for her.",0
My review of this is basically the same as the conditioner. Fragrance was way too overpowering. It dried out my hair and made my scalp itchy. Definitely not worth the money,0
"So the color was good but it was super clumpy. I personally don't like the thick clumpy look, I like it to look natural and clean. Was a little disappointed but I think its just a personal look choice. Product was good just not my look.",0

Great gel! I been using this gel for years.,1
"Gave my hair split ends, threw it in the garbage.",0
"I have tried other Vichy products; some I've liked and some I haven't. This one is not for me.

The product is a very light, white lotion. You dispense it by unscrewing the lid and waiting for a drop to fall off the dropper-like dispenser.  I tested it in the crook of my elbow first. It absorbed easily on first application, then it started burning. And burning. I don't have sensitive skin, but I had to go wash this off after 5 minutes. No way would I chance using this on my face.  It also has a very strong fragrance.

I'm disappointed that I can't use or recommend this serum.",0
"I like the refreshing feeling on my lips.  However, I think it is overpriced for the size.",1
"Pump was open, shampoo was spilled inside the bag and into the box. If it was $5 shampoo, fine, but it's $38. Not cool.",0
"It's okay. I usually use it and then find that it's not working very well so I end up just pulling my hair back into a bun. Some white residue when you use it, but brushing through helps.",0
Worked like the clear but with a little color.,1
It works and is so easy to use!,1
"Ive bought this product for a couple years - in salons, not via Amazon till now. Normally, the spray is colorless. The bottle I ordered from Amazon arrived translucent yellow and doesnt seem to have the same scent. Buyer beware.",0
Great price and top conditioner.,1
"I bought it because I read a lot of great review about the product. Before using it, I have done with Garnier Argan oil. Despite of the rave reviews of Moroccan oil, I found that one of the ingredients consist of dimethicone, which means silicone. I just disappointed why it doesn't consist of 100% moroccan oil.
I feel that this product is worse and overpriced. Because of the glass bottle, you also have to be extra careful to spill any oil and touch the bottle, very slippery. I broke the bottle and now I wasted more than a half left of it.",0
I like this product.  It stay on well.  It doesn't cause any eye irritation or skin irritation.  I have also used it as an eyeliner when I couldn't find mine.  It fills in eyebrows well.,1
"When I ordered BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA INVIGORATING BODY WASH, FLORA AND CASSIS SCENT, I did not realize that it was supposed to be a ""men's"" product.  But once the 10 oz bottle of BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA INVIGORATING BODY WASH, FLORA AND CASSIS SCENT arrived, we really did not care.  My husband, younger daught, and I all love it.

BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA INVIGORATING BODY WASH, FLORA AND CASSIS SCENT has quite a lovely smell.  It smells clean and fresh and light, not at all frou-frouy.  In my husband's words ""It gets me clean, doesn't make me smell like a girl, and washes away completely.""  In my 8 year old's words, ""I love it!  It smells nice and makes me feel pretty.""  Mom, here, likes the gentle, pleasant scent and how nice it lathers when I put it on my body puff.  And, a little bit of BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA INVIGORATING BODY WASH, FLORA AND CASSIS SCENT goes a long way. You really only need one pump from the bottle to clean an entire body.

The only reason to give BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA INVIGORATING BODY WASH, FLORA AND CASSIS SCENT 4 stars instead of 5 is because my family does not find it particularly ""invigorating."" Soothing and relaxing are better words.  But other that that, this family really loves BAXTER OF CALIFORNIA INVIGORATING BODY WASH, FLORA AND CASSIS SCENT.",1
love the gloss stick. hate the plastic lid.,1
"I purchased two sets of hair ties directly from the Emi-Jay website since I couldn't find the ones I wanted at Amazon.  They seemed fun to try out, but definitely pricey.

Cons

~ Hold
  They don't hold hair tight.  You cannot get any hair bump on top with these.  It's difficult to get the fabric to hold flat without it crunching and twisting as you wrap it around.

~ Usage
  They stretch too much with each use.  I can't see them lasting too long with regular use.

Pros

~ No Crease Line
  It is true that you don't get a wave or crease line in your hair after you use them, I think mainly because they don't hold tight.  The crease line doesn't bother me though.

~ Form
  They are cute and stylish and come in many colors.  I love the variety that is sold.

Solution
I realized that I need to use these for what they are... cute accessories.  So I use a regular band to put up the pony tail and hold hair tight, then add on the Emi-Jay tie over it.  This overall look of the pony tail with the fabric wrapped just once or twice is much better.  Plus the fabric stretch is minimal and can be re-used like it was new. I can also still use them as a bracelet too. I did add a little fabric glue to the cut edges to make sure that they don't fray.",1
I'm 48 years old and need to focus on taking care of my skin more. This produce makes my skin so soft and clean. The vibrations of the brush feels wonderful. Feels like I'm getting a sfacial treatment everyday.,1
good smell not crusty works as it should,1
did not like it at all. not sure how the smell is even close to Bergamot and Tobacco,0
"This made my hair stiff and feeling dirty. For what it cost I would of expected maybe a little bit of a wave.
I do have fine straight hair it did nothing, maybe if you have thick hair it may work better.
I would not recommend.",0
"This is nothing more than a bar of soap with Molton Brown labeling on it, what a waste of money.
I've been a loyal MB Black Peppercorn body wash user for years and thought I'd try this to take on a trip (no spillage) I should of saved the cost and used the soap in the hotel.",0
It's not working,0
"I have been using this product for almost 2 months now and only see a slight difference. This pack only lasted me 2 weeks but that is with me applying it on my thighs, butt, arms, and abs. The results were not great enough to persuade me to pay $90 each month for new lotions. I will stick will Nivea. At least I saw dramatic results after 2 weeks of using their product.",0
"I purchased this mirror due to its size and it is great to toss in my purse but the magnification is minimal. Not much different than the regular mirror. I was disappointed. I wanted this mirror to replace the 4"" magnification mirror I now carry but will not. I am surprised Xtreme Lashes would not have a better product  considering it is all about the eyelashes.",0
"Made my hair straight, lifeless, dry, and knotty.  My hair felt like it had a film on it.  It is a horrible product and it cannot be returned.  Had I known that I would have never purchased it.  Do not buy this product",0
"This item is JUNK!!! Never has worked right. They want $20.00 to replace it. Was too expensive to begin with, why would I want to pay anymore?",0
"2nd time Ive ordered this. Love the product, but second time the can has arrived cracked with product dripping out.",0
"smells nice but to me,it can almost be a unisex fragerance. its hard to describe and smells are subjective so hard to do a review.
I would say it has a bit of a sweet smell to it but still masculine but can also see a gal wearing this and pulling it off..",1
This TNS was old.  There was no white cream in it. I guess it was all dried up.,0
"This product promises to help prevent chipping and smudging.  It does NOT!!  In fact, I think it might actually make your nail polish more apt to chipping.  I applied the Butter London Base Coat - as directed.  Then I applied by color - as directed.  Then I applied this Butter London Top Coat - as directed.  After I knew it was completely dry, I went to bed.  The next morning - less than 8 hours after applying - one of my fingers was already chipping.  Once I got out of the shower, two more nails were chipped.  Within THREE DAYS every single one of my nails were chipped and peeling.  Complete waste of a hefty amount of money for what you get.",0
"Lashes definitely are longer,  but not thicker .  I will continue to use this product",1
Beautiful color and a great polish.,1
"It's a pretty color but when I think of a ""stain"" I think of something that last a lot longer.  This is off in minutes.",0
Haven't used long enough on me but my friends use it and their eyelashes look awesome,1
I bought this oil a few months ago and I'm pretty happy with it. It makes your hair nice and shiny and my hair seems to finish blow drying much quicker when I've used this product. I am in my forties and color my hair frequently so it often appears dull. This oil seems to be one of the few products that will really make it smooth and shiny and this it does really well. I don't notice my hair to be any easier to style or more bouncy or softer in texture and that is why I'm not giving it five stars. It seems to work more on the surface/appearance of my hair rather than penetrating the strands and changing the body or softness from within if that makes any sense. It is a good product and I will probably order it again unless I find some really great new hair product in the next few months. The bottle lasts quite a long time.,1
eh,1
"Pros:
Price! This is by far the best feature of this item. Blades are really really cheap and you can shave for pennies.
Weight: this razor has a nice feel
Less plastic thrown away
Safe: I have experienced very few nicks
2 sided blade means less rinsing
Cons
This shave will not match the Mach 5 ever! Others may disagree but it is reality.
Slower: you have to move slower and with greater care with this type of razor
Changing blades takes longer until you get the hang of it.",1
"Used faithfully twice a day as instructed. It's slightly greasy and my makeup would smudge. No noticeable improvement for me in skin texture, smoothness, tightness, hydration, or lightening dark circles. Big disappointment.",0
Just like other reviews it came broken. So disappointed.,0
As described. Promptly delivered.,1
"Product has a very pleasant fragrance, but only moderately effect in adding moisture to the skin. The price is fair.  Overall I give it 2 stars.",0
"I like that it directly targets the pores instead of just the overall facial area. To me, if it targets an area, it's formulated better to actually help instead of just trying to be a Jack of All Trades, Master of None. It goes on smoothly and ""feels"" like it's working (if you use masks, you know what that means haha).

I received a sample from PINCHme for free in exchange for review.",1
"The hand cream is great, but I was extremely unhappy that the pump applicator did not work.",1
"I have very dry skin.. and wrinkles. How could I  not accept the offer to try Juice Beauty Green Apple Age Defy Moisturizer? I gave this one 3 stars out of the box, because no animal testing is done. Star #4 was because it has natural products and no heavy fragrance. Also, it moisturizes. I began using it the morning it arrived and have been using it morning and night for several days.

Here is what i think. No product on the planet really makes wrinkles unwrinkle. There are a lot of products out there and some disappoint me because i find out that they use animal testing in the production of the product. Not necessary. In my particular case, I am sensitive to all sorts of environmental chemicals and drugs, so I like to stay as natural as possible with all of the products that I use in my home and on my person.

This product feels light to the touch and absorbs quickly into the skin with no greasy feel to it. I am able to apply make up immediately, with no wait time. Nothing makes wrinkles go away, but this does soften the skin and does away with flakiness. I would like to say that i will certainly buy this product again, but the price is a little high for my budget. What I will say is that I would like to be able to do so, and in fact would love to try their entire product line.",1
I love this product. I have dry skin but work in the restaurant setting and get lots of oils on my face but with this product I was able to maintain my face clean before going to bed and I felt refreshed and dos not feel my face dried out like other cleansers. Love this product and will continue to buy it,1
"I bought this product based on advice from a few websites but it doesn't seem to do anything, clumps up and does apply well and generally seems to be a waste of money.",0
"For me, this not not last very long and I got sunburned :(",0
Not impressed... doesn't seem to work,0
"I so wanted to love this sunblock. I tried the matte version of it in Hawaii and liked the feeling on the skin. I decided to get a classic one because according to reviews the other one gave people ""white mask"" effect. My first impression was - the pump is not working. It was very hard to get the cream through that pump. Once I managed to get some and applied, the cream had a very nice consistency and smelled nice too. I disregarded the pump and started falling in love with the cream. BUT in the evening I noticed that my face started to itch. The next morning I woke up with an almost completely shut from swelling left eye with extreme redness and itchy little bumps on the skin around both my eyes, on cheeks, and on the chin. I looked like someone hit me with their boots in the face. Gosh... I was so embarrassed to go to work that day. I put a huge layer of makeup to cover it all up but the swelling was hard to hide. So, needless to say I returned the cream and won't buy it again. I gave it 2 stars only because it's very natural supposedly and it felt on the skin like anything else before. But all that goodness was not for me, unfortunately.",0
"I have five other shellac, but this one bubbles up under the uv light...",0
"When I told my husband that I received a free bottle of this $71 product, he said, ""What if you like it?"" At that point, a week ago, I was highly skeptical,  and replied I doubted it would be an issue.

I'm in my fifties, and frankly, there's been no ""miracle beauty cure"" that I've thought has done a thing for my skin. Getting enough sleep, eating a good diet, protecting my skin from the sun,and washing my face with high quality mostly natural products has been my strategy. I was blessed with a good complexion and tight pores.

I think it would be bizarre to be my age and have no visible signs of aging. To want for that seems ridiculous, in my estimation. But, of course, I want to look my best, as we all do. My skin is fairly dry, has some age spots and lines, and the skin has become less taut. So, with great skepticism, I tried this. I've used neem oil in the past, as it's been used in India for a long, long time. I prefer oil to moisturizer, as I dislike the feeling of product sitting on one's face. Neem and coconut oil both are excellent moisturizers, but they both left my skin too greasy.

Much to my surprise, this Nia 24 really made my skin look and feel great upon the first application. It can be used alone or with another product. I used it alone first; three drops were plenty for my entire face. My skin felt moisturized without any greasiness and stayed that way through the day. I didn't make my skin red or tingly, as some others report. In addition, I was quite pleased that this product has a nice natural smell of citrus. A few minutes after application, I no longer noticed the smell, which is unusual these days with most skin care products. Very nice indeed!

As the week progressed, my skin really did look more healthy. I kept asking myself, ""Is it because you know this is pricey?"" Considering my extreme skepticism about any beauty products, I think the answer is no. I like how my skin feels and looks, and the sheerness of this product. As for the age spots, I have not noticed a difference, but if I do, I'll come back and give this five stars. Honestly, the only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that I can't really believe that $71 is a reasonable price. I know there are more expensive products out there, but there are also less, and I'm guessing someone is making a tidy profit. Of course, that's what companies do, but at this price, it's just a luxury that most people would have to think more than twice about. Sure, it's less than a shot of Botox, but that's not a great thing to compare it to. Still, I can't say anything else bad about this product other than the price is too high for this shopper. If it were less, I would definitely purchase it, though. I love the way my skin feels!

I used the product with some under-eye product and this worked really nicely.",1
"This dried out my hair and left it sticky.  I thought it was the same product I had purchased from a salon, and
was disappointed .",0
"I have used Elemis Soothing Chamomile Cleanser for several years, but the product I received had been watered down. Very disappointed as this is otherwise a quality product.",0
It does a worse job then regular toothbrush. My child did not like it. Did not clean well.,0
"This shampoo does feel harsh and it actually left my hair feeling drier than ever. I see all these great reviews and I'm really puzzled, it's not a good product for moisturizing hair.",0
"I've been a big Colorscience fan for at least 10 years. I love the way Wild to Mild feels on my skin! I use this on a daily basis in combination with the California Girl loose powder, or I'll use the Medium shade of the SPF 50 loose powder. I've been wearing ""heavier"" foundations (Giorgio Armani) a lot more, because it does give better coverage, but I've realized that I don't need that much when I'm not wearing a lot of makeup (special occasions)",1
It is hard to hold it because it is heavy for one hand only and I have been using it every other day for a couple of weeks now but still didn't see any changes. It is only good to use in the legs. Not so good for stomach and not made to use in arms and butty;),0
It is good. Better than L'Oreal products which left my face very dry.,1
I will continue to use for consistent change,1
I have been using this cream for a few months. I find that it does nothing to reduce under eye puffiness. I won't buy again,0
My dermatologist recommended I go to a sunscreen of 50 for my face.  I tried 2 other cheaper brands and they made my face feel hot and sweaty.  This is very light and does't burn.,1
"I just open the package today and I found the container looks really ""be used"", and this make me feel so uncomfortable",0
After 3 weeks of use some pimples appeared. So I am not using as much I was..,0
"Although I buy everything fragrance free that I can, I have a large and well-loved collection of rare, vintage, and high-end niche perfumes. I remember experiencing some other NUXE product and found it pleasant. I had a Shiseido Relaxing Water years ago that was really quite lovely, like you had just been in a room where Japanese incense had been burning. This: a potentially head-ache inducing (if you are susceptible to headaches; it might just make you lash out at some someone if politeness is your weak link, or trigger an asthma attack) brew is bad. Why? Why was it created? It's just an overpriced bottle of strong chemicals that you should never wear around infants. If you must wear it (I will try to extend tolerance), ONE spritz is enough! Well, actually too much. The scent is an insulting clich&eacute;, with notes of baby powder, plastic toy pony, fruit Twizzler and musk scratch-n-sniff. Frighteningly bad.",0
The pigment gradually gets into the contact lenses and makes it blurly -- returned it,0
"This oil came in open and squashed box, it was not sealed, I am not certain that it's authentic.",0
"I don't know what it's made of, but it seriously does not wash off of anything.

I had to throw my comb away because it wouldn't wash off of it. I washed the comb several times with soap, and I even let it soak in very hot soapy water. No matter what I did, it just wouldn't come off the comb. It created a permanent waxy residue.

It is also nearly impossible to wash this stuff out of your hair in one wash. It took more than several washings to get most of it out of my hair to the point where my hair didn't feel stiff and sticky.

And forget about getting your hands clean after you've styled your hair. Be prepared to have at least some residue stuck to your hands throughout the day.

Save your money. I promise you will use this product one time and then throw it away.",0
"This is the best body wash for anyone with keratosis pilaris. I have tried pretty much every drug store body wash and specialty high end body wash for my severe case of this skin condition. I have spent hundreds maybe even thousands to get rid of the bumps and dry skin. Nothing that I've tried has worked as well as the Glytone body wash and lotion. I use the body wash everyday and my skin has never been smoother. If you don't have keratosis pilaris,  I would recommend using every couple of days because the acid may be a little harsh but if you have a severe case like mine, I would definitely try it. It is the only body wash I've found that is actually worth it's price tag.",1
"Have had my Clarisonic for 2 years.  Have bought brush head replacements, and they have been great!
The first brush lasted about 3 weeks, the second one not that long.
I didn't initiate the return soon enough, glad these were cheap!  Perhaps that is why they disintegrated!",0
"I chose this rate because the product complies with the request exatamete.
I like the timeliness of the delivery date.
and highly recommend this produto and shop",1
"Love this product, specially in Florida, a lot of humidity.",1
Necessary staple,1
"It is very thick, and the viscosity keeps it from easily spreading.  I find it is either too thick or too thin on my face and difficult to peel off.",0
I am not sure why people rave over this stuff. It chips off just as quickly as any other nail polish. I have very thin nails and I need polish on them to keep them from splitting and breaking. I'm always looking for something that will last longer than a day. This was not that product.,0
Loved the color n gloss but brush for gloss broke off after 1st use had to use my finger to apply the gloss.  For such an expensive product expected better.,0
Product is as advertised and doesn't cause any skin irritation. Good addition to bronzers and blushers.,1
"My order arrived on time but it came all leaky and looked unsanitary. So I requested a new bottle from amazon. They shipped it to me in 4 days and the second bottle was perfect. The smell is very very light and pleasant. I use it after washing my face before bed. It keeps me moist during the night. Considering that it is hot where I live, I do sweat and get a little greasy at night so I only spray a little. In the winter I think I'll use something before the spray thou. I read online that this spray is bad for the skin and that it contained ingredients unnecessary for the skin but my skin has been doing really well with it. I noticed that there is a glow on my face in the morning after I wash my face and i din't get irritated or break out from it so i'll keep using it.",1
"$10 toothpaste is a luxury considering how much you can purchase regular toothpaste for. However, one tube of toothpaste does last for quite a long time, and if you grew up hating brushing your teeth because of the taste like I did, this stuff is perfect. I find I actually spend time properly brushing my teeth instead of trying to get it over with as quickly as possible, so for me this is money well spent.

Onto the problems:

Marvis is supposed to come sealed. Full-sized or travel-sized, there should be a seal inside the cap. If you received unsealed toothpaste like I did, contact customer service!",1
Great intense moisturizer! Exactly what my skin needed.,1
Wonderful fragrance!  Second to none !,1
"Bought it for myself, but my wife grabbed it and hasn't let go. Seriously, we both think it's great. Greaseless and does the job.",1
Soooo not the Chi I know,0
After a day or two of using this product I thought it was gonna be great but I was wrong. Within one week I started getting cystic pimples on my temples and cheek. I continued using it for two weeks total and nothing changed. Definitely not worth the price if it causes cystic pimples which I have not had in 2 years,0
I don't see what the hype is all about,0
Stayed on only for a day or so,0
If you are looking forward to one of the best hair straighners don't purchase this one. Its totaly fake. I received this product and automatically returned it when i opened it. i am going to buy an actual titanuim hair straightner at a beauty sypply . Trsut me tis isn't worth the price at all ,0
Totally not worth the money.  Nothing special about it.,0
"Scam,scam,scam and DON'T waste your money!!!!!! It does not do a single thing to wrinkles and how they promise you that it does is all bogus!!! None of these wrinkle reducers are absolutely not strong enough to even touch a wrinkle and only surgery or Botox can fix these type of problems!",0
Used all of product without any change noticeable AT ALL,0
I bought this because I realized I never put sunscreen under my eyes and that's not good! Your under eye skin is extremely delicate and sensitive and this product does an awesome job of protecting it! I don't have much under eye darkness but this helps the little that I do. I am also very pale so the white sheen this product can create doesn't bother me.,1
"Used it for years, best styling product for a light/medium hold out there",1
Smells heavily of old lady perfume scent. I would love to enjoy the benefits of this soap but I can not get past the smell. Smaller than a standard bar of soap.,0
"This is a terrible eyeliner. I havdn't seen anything like this before. It is like plastic, coming off in pieces, very annoying.",0
The color was supposed to be natural. It is a light coral disappointed.,0
"I have sensitive skin and this retinol formula is supposed to be irritation free or at least minimally irritating.  I started out using it twice a week and then when absolutely nothing happened, I stepped it up to every night.  I did this for three weeks and nothing happened.  My skin didn't look any different.  I know this is a mild formula but surely I would have seen some positive change during this time.  I definitely think I received a fake, either that or this formula is so mild that it isn't effective at all.  I'm sorely disappointed in this product, which was not cheap by any means.  I'm going to order the 1% formula directly from the Avene website and that way I'll be assured that it's the authentic product.  They don't even sell the .5% formula on the company site, so that should have told me something.  I guess they don't make it anymore.  Obviously I received a fake or an expired product because I would have expected some positive change after 3 weeks of use and zero happened.  I wouldn't waste your money on this product.  If you want a mild retinol that's suitable for sensitive skin, order the 1% formula directly from the company.  I discovered this brand in Bazaar magazine, which had an article written by a dermatologist in which this sensitive skin retinol formula was touted by the author as being a sensitive skin formula.  I always thought I couldn't use retinol at all because I had a bad reaction to Retin A years ago as well as a severe reaction to a Philosophy retinol serum I tried two years ago.  I want the benefits of retinol but my skin cannot handle the irritation, I break out in angry red patches and my eyes swell shut.  I thought this mild formula was the answer to my prayers.  However, I spent a significant sum of money only to be duped.  This formula did nothing, nada.  I'm going to order the 1% formula directly from Avene.  I'm sure it will be a great product because the doctor who mentioned it is quite well know and the article gave the company website as the place to purchase.  I will not order another skin care product from Amazon.  This is the second or third time I've been duped.  I've learned an expensive lesson.  If you want to try this product, don't get it here.  I definitely do not recommend whatever is in this bottle.  I think it's just some greasy cream and whoever sells it has been able to dupe a fancy bottle and pump.",0
"One of the main reasons I use it is because it smells soooo good. I think it's been making my hair softer but it's not like a miracle-worker or anything; if it is making a difference, it's not a huge difference. Still, I'd recommend it",1
there is nothing special about this shampoo. I wouldn't buy it again.,0
love it leaves my hair smooth and silky protects the hair from Heat Damage,1
"I use it everyday twice, it keeps my skin protected and doesnt feel sticky and doesnt smell. I recommend this product.",1
Nice nighttime moisturizer!,1
"The product is good and works pretty well, however I was guaranteed a shipping date of two days after I ordered and it took 7 for me to receive it! I would say Greta product but seller not so much!",0
"A very beautiful nail polish. It dries fast and lasts long.
Love the texture and the color goes with everything.",1
I took bath with this and went to bed in the night it had the worst smell. It was very suffocating. This is not for everyone.,0
"This is a leave-in conditioner is recommended for damaged, weakened hair.  My color treated and heat styled hair can be a bit on the damaged side so I thought I would test this out.  This conditioner is recommended for medium to coarse hair and i found I had to be careful not to add too much to my medium hair or it would get weighed down.  The scent on this was light and pleasant.  I found my hair seemed soft and more manageable.  Overall, a good product but probably best for thick to coarse hair.",1
"Great product, does not make my combination skin break out and keeps it soft and bright throughout the winter days.",1
"I used it consistently, as directed, on my face and underarms. On my underarms I did notice a reduction in hair thickness several weeks after using the device. However, this effect was temporary and all of the hairs grew back the same thickness as before after a couple of months. It had no effect on my upper lip, chin and neck. And I actually am seeing new hair growth on my neck that I never had previously. I don't know whether this is due to the Silk'n or not, but it is very odd and I am unhappy about it.",0
I have very little eyebrow hair so did not work for me,0
"god product, little overpriced",1
Adds texture to hair,1
works as expected,1
old product,0
good product.,1
Makes my dry hair soft and silky...smells good too,1
This is a GREAT product for adding body to your hair. LOVE it!,1
Not happy with the smell - almost smells like vomit. Conditioner is not so great - doesn't do anything for detangling. Shampoo does ok with the hard water issue.,0
Nothing special.  Not worth the money.,0
So disappointed! The box basically contains items you could pick up for free at cosmetic counters.,0
"Scent is spicy, masculine, and overpowering. Do not purchase if you are sensitive to scents. Lotion would be great if they made an unscented version.",0
"My dermatologist recommend me this product, and I love it, I have use it for more than a year and a half and I won't change it.",1
This curling iron is so disappointing to me based on all the great reviews. First thing I noticed was it didn't he and hold the curl as good as I thought it would secondly it nearly burns your thumb and lastly the cord it's a tangled mess. And no auto off switch really?? Would not buy again,0
I needed shampoo but instead I got conditioner my bad god bless,0
"I ordered this product to give it a try.  So far it seems  to work okay.
It's kind of hard to put it on the bck of my head,but I will keep using it.

I do have to say that my daughter ordered and she loves it.",1
"My go to hair product. Easy to work in, and great matte finish. The hold is so-so, I just put a bit of hair spray to finish it and hold it in place longer.",1
"I've been eyeing this polish for a long time, and I finally decided to give in and try it the other day when I was a Nordstrom. It obviously isn't cheap at $14 for .4 fl oz, but it is definitely worth the money. I still have very weak nails from getting acrylic nails for a special occasion a couple of months ago, so usually when I paint them with three coats and a base and top coat they still tend to chip rather fast. I used this product in the color ""Union Jack Black"" yesterday, and today I ran a bunch of errands that normally would cause the paint to chip. To my surprise, my manicure is still as immaculate as it was yesterday!!

I would give this product five stars, but I dislike the brush (I prefer flat brushes) and I had to use 4 coats of polish to cover completely. Also, it took a while to dry.",1
Son loved it!,1
Bought it for my fiance and she loves it - they're really expensive in stores.,1
"This dry shampoo or actually powder is the best I have tried. I have normal to oily hair and this gets me through about a half a day of feeling I don't need my hair washed, which is all I wanted it for. I tried this a few months ago ran out and tried a few different over the counter spray dry shampoos and none of them worked so I went back to this product.",1
"I guess you get what you pay for.
It's not horrible but it's not as thorough as my mom's $150 babyliss.",0
"Has worked pretty well, but not perfectly. 4 stars",1
Great price. Quick shipping.,1
I was beyond excited to receive this in the mail as I have used Footlogix in my career as a salon receptionist and have been convinced that Footlogix products are hands down the best for your feet! Upon receiving the file I noticed it is a bit smaller than the professional one but it works AMAZINGLY! I ordered the Callus Softener spray and let it sit for about 5 minutes before filing my calluses away and my feet feel better than when I go for a pedicure at a salon! So amazing and I am so satisfied with my purchase! Will recommend to everyone!,1
"This is my all time favorite eyeshadow.  The color is very natural looking but it still gives the eye a nice definition.  This is a good base color
for the daytime look.",1
"I thoroughly enjoy CND Vinylux polish and top coat, as it is as long lasting as is advertised. The only reason I did not give the Top Coat five stars
is because it is packaged in a solid black bottle, not allowing me to see how much is left! This is a packaging issue of practical implications, which can be easily remedied.",1
The pink part was like 1/3 the bottle Im not sure if thats normal but 1 tip dip for 7 day cut that on half doesnt seem like it will last long.,0
"IDK that it really gets hot enough to straighten my hairs at first pass - which, considering the brand, it really should be high-quality enough to do.",1
It does help my nail polish last longer. I had it before some years ago and i was satisfied as well. Also it lasts me 4- 6 months using it 2 times per week,1
Overly perfumed. Disappointed in this product that is targeted towards men. Smell doesn't wear off easily which is actually a negative.,0
"you can't return it, if you don't like it.",0
I bought this mask because of the (healthy) ingredients. But the mask that arrived contains parabens and carrageenan - so the opposite.,0
This is a very good shampoo for dry hair.  I use it along with  Exquisite Conditioner and my hair is ever so soft and shiny. I don't end up with the tangles I get with other expensive salon type products. It's well worth the money.,1
"I don't know why, but the peeling in my fingernails is drastically worse than when I first started using this product. I initially was usuing the regular nail envy, which was great. I figured this would help with my *specific* problem of layers of my nail peeling away. Nope. Not only is this a very poor base coat (the polish on top chips and peels within a couple of days), but no matter how many or few coats, how thick or thin, my nails were peeling worse. Instead of just occasionally peeling when they were long, now 9/10 nails are peeling, 4 of which are peeling at 3-5 mm from the top. The abosolute worst part? I can't return to Amazon, because it's 'hazardous.'

If you're going to use this, I HIGHLY suggest buying it in-store first to see if it works, then buying it online. Otherwise, you're stuck with a 10 dollar bottle of crap to throw in the trash.",0
I didn't like this product. It turned my part line yellow. I got a refund.,0
It is as it is described! It is just a good finishing touch,1
"This is a great Mist! I really really like it. I wish it had some SPF but you can't have everything in life can you?
Smells delicious and my face feels really refreshed after I spray it.",1
"I liked the feel and texture of this product and the fact that it is a mineral sunscreen with a high SPF protection  However it was way too dark for me  I had purchased  this product intending to use it as an all in one treatment, primer and make up  I would recommend this product if it were available in more options than just a medium skin tone  Should be available in light and dark as well as medium skin tones",1
SOooooo....this product did work well at keeping the neonatal acne at bay....but dried out baby's skin too much so stopped using it. Not for us. Maybe when he's older,0
Great brush,1
"I really like this palette, the quality is good and it came packaged nicely the only flaw I saw was I didn't know the whole feeling naughty/feeling nice thing so I didn't know the packaging changed.",1
Don't destroy your nails with this product. It's horrible!!,0
"The results of use seem to be modest and temporary, but real. The thing we noticed was that while the ingredients may be organic, that doesn't mean they can't be irritating to sensitive skin. For example, soluble aspirin is part of the formula (salicylic acid from willow bark) so if you are sensitive to that, this may not be for you.",1
Helps with setting curls.,0
It leave my hair hard like hair spray,0
The bristles are very hard and not flexable. I purchased this to use in the shower and it was painful on my scalp.,0
Strong smell and gave me a rash and turned me red as soon as i put it on on belly. I have sensitive skin- this is not for me.,0
"This item was advertised as being tinted and even stated ""tinted"" on the bottom of the box. However, it is NOT tinted.",0
"Really not impressed with this product, very high in price for the amount/size. I wouldn't buy it again. Wouldn't waste the money..seriously overpriced ineffective",0
"This stuff is very gentle. I can't tell if it is working Bc I added it to a broader skin routine. That said, it's very expensive so I don't plan to buy it again given that I can't see a definite difference.",0
great lather  I don't like the smell,1
LOVE!!!! Pink with microglitter. Bought 2 bottles!,1
I usually do not comment on things but I figured I would give it a shot considering that I read reviews before purchasing an item. The product received great reviews therefore I bought it. I have facial acne and I was using panoxyl for months with other topicals that controlled my outbreaks. I ran out of panoxyl and since it is so hard to come by I tried this for only 2 weeks. Needless to say it didn't work for me. I went back to my original regimen.,0
"I was hesitant to purchase this at my local drug store because of the price tag but I purchased the little sample size, and to my surprise this product was perfect. It's very gentle to the skin and removes my make-up very well. A lot of other people complain about it not removing eye make-up well but I find that it works fine. I just hold my cotton pad on my eyelid for a few seconds and then gently wipe off, or if it isn't enough I just use another eye make-up remover although I usually don't need to. I wear eyeshadow, mascara, and a gel liner everyday and it removes everything alright for me.",1
I believe this is a fake OPI. The bottle I got looks different from the ones I buy from the store. And after one day my nails were all chipped.,0
"I have had this product for a day.  I have applied it over light make-up...and after my shower. My skin feels incredible. I can't get over this true product that actually delivers. I am a sceptical person...personal experience has made me that way. Don't know how, but this is a youth spritz. My skin feels so nice",1
Irritates the skin and not as easy to remove the makeup as it claims,0
"Love, love, love this hair dryer. I have medium to thick hair. This will dry my hair on average in 3 minutes. A lot of power, and very quiet by hair dryer standards. An added plus is that it is very light weight and the controls are on the side of the hand grip. No more turning it off while trying to dry or style my hair. It has a heavy duty cord that is 9 ft. long very nice as well.",1
"this came partially frozen , 2 weeks late, and barlely dispenses,  I am very displeased.

after using it for a month with a new bottle , i love it!",1
This is my first time using this product. It made all my lashes clump together and made my false and real lashes fall out. I wold not recommend it.,0
"I'm pleased with this conditioner.  Some reviewers complained about it leaving their hair dry but I didn't find that to be true.  My hair is very fine which may account for the different experiences.  I cannot use heavy conditioners because they weigh my hair down.  I gave this four stars because there's nothing truly unique about it that I can tell.  I gave the shampoo five stars because of the interesting, luxurious texture.",1
"I have used this product for the past several years and it is flawless. I learned after using the first tub of it that the price one pays is ABSOLUTEY worth it. Used properly, one tub lasts a long time. The shaving experience renders an extremely smooth shave with a good feel afterwards. Also, I have skin allergies and this unscented shaving cream meets my needs perfectly. I highly recommend it.",1
"I'm a fan of Dermablend--great concealers and powders, but this foundation wasn't my favorite. For one, it's a lot cooler (pink) than I was expecting (I got the shade 30w Yellow Beige).  It doesn't feel heavy on the skin, but it looked very mask-like. It did last on me all day and it was very full coverage, but it didn't look good.",0
Love it!,1
"Decided to try this after reading previous reviews. Omg, it is my favorite facial moisturizer ever. Even though I am in my mid 50's I still have combination skin and this is the perfect light daytime moisturizer for my skin. Creamy, moisturizing and soaks in wonderfully not leaving behind an oily shine to my skin. It is a creamy, slightly gel type consistency. Makes my skin look and feel wonderfully after using. I do not wear make-up base, only use this day time moisturizer, a little powder and blush and my skin looks and feels radiant. Excellent product! I am also using the Ahava Hand & Foot Cream, equally satisfied.",1
Love Butter Londen! Manicure lasts a week w/o chips if I am careful and wear gloves while doing dishes.,1
It did not repair my skin pigmentation problem!,0
Thick and mask-like.  I was looking for a more natural finish.,0
smells great,1
It was basically just black powder? I expected little hair follicles like the Hair Illusion brand..,0
"The make up clearly not  fresh. The foundation is separating apart not only in tube, but also on my face.",0
"Used this on my toddler and infant who both suffer from dry skin and eczema. When I used it on my toddler he initially cried and said it burned. I figured it was a little cool on his skin so I made sure to warm it up in my hands, no help. Same with the infant. She became very fussy and squirmy when I rubbed her body down with the lotion. Tried it again the next day, but made sure my toddler didn't see it just in case he recognized it from the night before, and still the same. They both cried and seemed to be very uncomfortable.",0
Awesome color pallette. Daytime and evening looks.,1
Thanks,1
I am so glad I switched to a Mercur Safety Razor! I used Gillette for years and it irritates my neck so badly. With the Mercur I get a way better shave at a way better price. It takes a month to get used to but it works great. Highly recommended!,1
too light,0
"When you click on the link, you'll see an eau de perfume, not a body lotion, thats why I bought this item, and what my surprise when I received the ""wrong item"".  Amazon has to be careful about this.  Problem is when you click at the 6.8oz, at the product presentation, at this time, picture has to be refreshed showing the right picture (a body lotion).",0
pretty,1
Horrible,0
"I'm going to go through this point by point because I really wanted to like this product but found it lacking in several areas.

First, the applicator. You push up on a ""button"" at the bottom to get the product onto the brush. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't - as in you get nothing, or you get too much, or if you're lucky it's just right.''

Second, the color. It looks much darker than it is, and once applied it gives a *tiny* bit of shimmer if you use enough, but not much more than that. Additionally, when I put it on over my makeup, it basically 'washed' my makeup off. When I tried to put it on first and then put makeup over it (both options are suggested on the product's box, by the way), my makeup, which is very light in terms of coverage, hid what little ""illumination"" this product offered.

Third, I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned that it made their skin feel tight. It wasn't the most unpleasant sensation ever, but it also isn't the way I want my skin to feel after applying a product that is supposed to soothe it.",0
It is light but crazy loud. Should have passed on this one.,0
"Really nice product & I love this color in particular...the applicator is a bit weird & hard to start, but eventually, you get used to it, because it's worth it. I usually apply early in the day and, if I'm going out in the evening, once more.",1
"overall, CND vinylux is the best polish I've ever used.  Love the polish, just not this color.  Although it says no bottom coat needed, maybe that's what this color needs",0
"Economical, handy, effective. Tears easily.",1
"I am not going to waist my money on this product based on the reviews none of them seem to be boasting about it, I like most oribe shampoos and masques but the signature shampoo I found left my hair greasy.",0
"This has evolved into my favorite hair conditioner.  My hair is dry, dry, dry and the highlights don't help.  Pureology Anti-Fade Conditioner seems to keep my hair healthy.  I particularily like that it doesn't take me forever to rinse enough of it out of my hair to reach a  point where it feels clean, not gooey.  There is a strong scent, but I love it.",1
Good lather. Strong sandalwood smell I was not a fan of but got used to it now. I prefer JM Fraser's smell.,1
I tried this product recently with high hopes. I wanted to use it for mild redness especially on and around the nose. I was surprised. I applied it sparingly. Then I applied my makeup. About 5 minutes later I looked in a mirror to discover my face had turned chalk white. I could hardly believe my eyes. I was as white as snow. My foundation is not a porcelain color. This stuff turns my makeup ghost white! I find I can make some use of it with just a drop spread over my nose. But I do not use it anywhere else on the face. I won't buy it again.,0
This is a good moisturizer no matter what your skin type. It absorbs in the skin quickly and softens it.,1
Its ok.,1
"This makes my hair smell awesome, feel fuller and softer! GREAT product for dry, bleached blonde hair.",1
"Goes on smoothly with no tug.  Not as much glitz as you might think, a nice sheen that peeks up your eyes.  Does not stay on/last as long as similar products by Makeup Forever.",1
"Purchased from SkinCareRX. I took photos for myself before using this product and again after. They were closeups at multiple angles. I took new ones yesterday and since using this product, fine lines have TRIPLED. Literally, there are 3 deep lines under my eye, where there used to be 1.

I don't know why it didn't work for me or why my skin reacted this way, but I'm very disappointed. I would request a refund if it had been within 30 days, but I started using it in February (seven months of continuous use).",0
Used once and woke up with red burnt eyelids where I applied it! There must be something bad in this stuff. Latisse didn't do this to me.,0
Didn't find a sharpener to be able to use it once the tip is gone.,0
"great color, a good summer go-to shade",1
Great for fine hair. Only a tiny amount is needed for fullness.,1
The creams are old and smell awful!  What a waste of time and money it is to buy from providers that don't sell what they advertise.,0
I have to rub my face pretty hard to clean off the makeup. And after that my skin gets irritation from non-alcoholic toner and lotion that's I regularly use that didn't give me problems.,0
"Unfortunately I don't like this product. A friend loves this and recommended it to me. I am the person applying it and then walking away and coming back to mirror to notice I look the same. My darker blonde/light brown roots look as noticeable as before applying the product. After watching videos of the blonde and darker colors they often, I have to admit it looks like the darker colors work easier to cover a and blend. Overall I find the blonde color to NOT BE EFFECTIVE at covering a few grays or darker roots growing out.",0
Made my KP worse actually. I moisturized as followed but the redness in my skin was worse than before. Seems to be a little harsh on the skin even though the exfoliating texture is light.,0
"Great fall color, can not wait to wear it.  Love CND products, have several of their colors in my collection.",1
Smells amazing but buy in store. It leaked all over...half of the bottle is empty!! I opened it to the box soaked in perfume and the bottle half gone before I ever took the cap off. Sad and waste of money,0
This is simply the best shampoo out there for me. Now I can just refill my travel sized containers.,1
"I have used this sunscreen before so I know what it should smell like.  The sunscreen I received had a lousy smell and I believe it was old.  Amazon let me return it and it was a fast process.  I then ordered the same sunscreen directly from the manufacturer.  It showed up in a different bottle and had the nice smell I'm used to.  So... it's a great product but don't order it through Amazon's seller, order it direct.",0
"I've purchased this cologne two years in a row as a present for my best friend and each time I got exactly the product in perfect condition. It's packaged well, he loves it, and it's a decent price for me. Win-win-win. 5 stars.",1
The expiration date will be by the end of 2018.,0
Love it!,1
"I really loved this dryer.... at first. but just after 6 months of use it has died. very disappointed for the money that was spent. I am giving it 2 stars because it is light and quiet as advertised, just wish it lasted longer. I will not be purchasing another....",0
"The smell is just to intense and perfume-y for me.  I've been using it on and off for a month now.  The first day I used it, I was really bothered by the smell; it almost made me feel a little sick because I couldn't get away from it!  Yesterday I lay down next to my partner in the evening (after using the product in the morning) and she said, ""Eeew, you smell like perfume.""  So I'm done with it now.  Shopping for something else.

Also... the texture is VERY thick.  I really need to rub the balm a lot to warm it up and get some on my fingers, and then I have to really rub my fingers together a lot to keep getting it soft enough to apply to my beard.  It tugs at my beard a fair bit to get it evenly applied, but once it is on it does give a lot of body to my beard.

If the scent works for you, then it would be fine.  I prefer more 'earthy', 'piney', sandalwood types of scents.

For comparison... I have also used ""Honest Amish Beard Balm.""  The texture of that was softer, creamier, and a little bit more oily(in a good way.)  I give it a thumbs up for texture.  However the smell of Honest Amish didn't work too well for me either - but it was not too strong, and it faded after application.  It almost had a hint of 'vaseline' odor to it.  It didn't bother me, but it didn't please me.  So I am still searching.",0
"I lost it on my first use, and for that reason I would want my money back, please.",0
"It is kind of hard to rate a face cream/serum, but I think this is is definitely worth using. Since I got it, I have noticed that the fine lines under my eyes are slightly less obvious. I was a little disappointed that it did not have any impact upon some small, red cars that I have (Vit E seems to work best for those) but it does help with flaky skin or fine little wrinkles. Just for fun and to test this further, I put a little on the ""crepey"" skin on the backs of my hands and also on a rough/flaky bruised spot under my knee that I developed from kneeling while putting in a new floor. One day (yes, one day) after I used it on the spot under my knee, the skin was no longer flaky and looked much healthier. The backs of my hands also looked smoother and less ""crepey"". Why did I do those things with a face serum? If you regularly use face cream, it can be really hard to see if one cream does a lot better than another and I wanted a way to see if it was actually doing something (or if it was my imagination or residual from other creams).

The bottom line is that I think it does work, although it didn't seem to have much impact on old scars. Also, by the end of the day, those fine lines are back, so it's not a permanent solution. It helps and really, that's what a face serium is all about.",1
"It has a unique smell to it that's a bit annoying. But it's very easy to apply and it lasts for a couple days, which makes it superior to the drug store brands.",1
"This seemed like a great idea, but just didn't work out for me.  It feels like I have sheetrock dust stuck in my hair.",0
"Easy to use, the only concern was that the temperature cannot be lower than 325.",1
To do all over again WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT.  Is it suppose to do anything but spray your face because you can do that with cool water & save $$,0
Wonderful sunscreen,1
I like that this product is both tinted and a sunscreen.  Over it I brush on Physicians face powder as I have dark age spots.  The combination works well.,1
Not the most moisturizing. But it smells good and isn't sticky or prone to leave residue.,1
I have been using BareMinerals for years but this relief powder really covers up my red adult acne spots and helps to cover the mistakes of my skin great. I do NOT know if it really reduces redness but it covers great for sure!!! I highly recommend trying it! The only reason I gave 4 stars because it can make the skin and under my eyes look dry if I don't use enough moisturizer.,1
Doesnt work,0
"Poor quality, didn't work for me. I am not convinced it's an authentic L'Occitane product. Ended up giving it away.",0
Very expensive for a hand creme that has shown me no difference.  Bought other products in this line and like just can't say much good for this handcreme,0
This product is rather worthless--doesn't do anything.  I would not recommend or purchase again.,0
"I took this because I am very pale and need sunscreen daily. I am not impressed. I let this warm up in my bathroom for 8 hours before I tried it ( it was cold coming in from the mail). I almost could not get it out of the tube, it was so thick. It did not apply easily with a make up sponge so I used my fingers. My skin looked uniform but uniformly chalky.

I am not sure who the intended market is for this product but I ended up with an unpleasant orange tone to my skin. Unless I followed this with a lot of foundation, I could never wear it to work or out. I might take it with me on a camping vacation where no one will really see me. Overall I did not like the thick consistency nor the color tone. It would be helpful for customers to get a sense of how deep the color is of this product....perhaps a color swatch? Had I known the depth of the color I'd have never chosen this.",0
"Really dried out my skin.  I'm really happy with the rest of my Cellex-C products, but I switched back to Cetephil for my regular cleanser to use along with the other items.  I returned this product.",0
"I bought this after reading reviews hoping it would help my breakable, fine, straight hair. It smells awesome, and it feels great when I put it on in the shower. However, it doesn't seem to do much for me. I don't see or feel any difference after I dry my hair. It doesn't do anything for my hair. I'm going to have to find  new product.",0
"This color looks more raspberry in the photo, but was a true red when I received it.  It was disappointing.  What was worse was that the color was very thick.  I could not apply thin layers, and the polish took longer to cure than I expected it would.  I don't know whether to send it back or not, because I don't know how to thin the color, or if it would be helpful to do that.",0
"The lather is really good, and the aroma is pleasant and light.  It doesn't last as long as others I've tried, but it feels good and doesn't clog the razor like some gels and shaving soaps.  Leaves me feeling clean.",1
It was so small.  I guess I didn't realize how little I was getting for the price.,0
"This didn't work for me at all. By midday I was sweaty and smelled bad, no matter what temperature it was outside. I had to stop using it.",0
Not suitable for people with med to dark skin completions. And the pigments are very muted and grey looking pin the skin. The lip gloss is ok,0
Really like this stuff.,1
"OPI needs to reformulate this nail treatment to exclude formaldehyde, which is a known carcinogen! I would advise you to skip on this product and try a formaldehyde-free nail strengthener. Orly makes one and I've seen a few other brands that specifically say ""formaldehyde-free.""",0
"UPSET that the bottle arrived half empty!!! Goes to show you never know through Amazon. Love this perfume, but will never purchase through Amazon again.",1
"I'm not sure what the praise is about because this definitely does not help to make the polish last for even 1 day. My polish chipped after 5 hours of regular activities. The only upside is, it helps your polish dry VERY quickly.",0
"I'm a bit of shave geek, so I was really happy to receive these products via the Vine program.  The kit includes a spritzer bottle of pre/post shave and a tube of after shave balm.  I've applied the pre-shave both by the suggested method of a hot cloth and by spraying directly on my face and working it in.  Honestly, I don't detect much difference when using it or not, but it does feel nice on my skin.  The after shave balm is absolutely heavenly.  My face feels and smells great after applying just a small amount after shaving and stays moisturized all day.  I'll purchase the balm again, but probably pass on the pre-shave.",1
Very nice.  A little light in color.,1
"First, about my skin: I have combination, acne-prone skin. My T-zone is oily, the rest of my face is normal to dry. I have issues with hormonal acne on my cheeks, chin and jawline. My forehead and nose are clear with just an occasional pimple. I have acne scars and want to prevent future ones, so I need to wear sunscreen every day, and this was one of many I've tried.

The texture is slippery. Other reviewers said this and I wasn't sure what that meant until I tried it. The word for it is definitely ""slippery."" Because of the texture and how thick it is, it's difficult to use the full recommended 1/4 tsp. of sunscreen (anyone who is saying you only need to use a little bit of this isn't applying enough) as it is hard to rub in. It never fully absorbed, just sat on my skin and felt heavy all day. It did not, however, make me look greasy, and I did see the ""blurring"" effect another reviewer mentioned - my scars and pimples were a bit less noticeable.

But it gave me tons of closed comedones on my forehead after only 2 days of wear. I'm assuming I must be sensitive to all the silicones.

As with any skincare product, YMMV. But this didn't work for me.",0
Love this stuff!! Very natural and good for your hair. A bit expensive but worth it!,1
"This will only work if you are very pale and have avoided the sun...which I have been doing. The effect is a nice glow- not a dark tan. I used to sun, but now avoid sun and use SPF everyday. My skin has become pale and some redness is creeping through.  I have some sun damage from my youth and hoped this would blend in...

-Update: I've noticed that the glow is nice- however, any decent toner will clean it off your face. I have put this on my face to get a nice glow and one pass with a decent toner removed it with a bunch of pretty golden stain on a pad. Too bad. I really wanted to love this. If you have high quality products, this will not last. Also it has a sesame seed oil or something smelly that lingers with some residue on your face. It's kind of gross.",0
The perfect amout of tint when you need a little smoothing out.,1
Best product I've come across to use when blow drying my hair straight.  Helps speed the process and give it a great shine all while protecting it from heat,1
"Great shampoo that deep cleans and keeps my medium blond color lasting longer, yet still leaving my hair feeling soft and shiny. You only need about a quarter size every time you shampoo, it lasts over 6 months. A hairdresser friend recommended when I complained about my towns water.  It was leaving my hair copper toned after 2 weeks of color treatment.",1
"I like the scent a lot and the bowl makes it easy to brush on.  It also lasts a long time, I shave my head every day and this little bowl lasted me about 5 months before I needed to replace it.",1
Great moisturizer .,1
I've bought this hairspray twice. Both times the can stopped spraying after just one use. Can't do anything to make it keep spraying. These bottles appear to be defective...I do not recommend buying unless you want to get stuck with a can of expensive hairspray that you can't use.,0
"I've used this product for the past 8 - 10 years.  I am very fair skinned and prone to precancerous skin lesions.  365 days a year, this is my facial moisturizer and skin protection.  I can't imagine using anything else.",1
"I'm so happy to find this product available on Amazon. I used to get it from my esthetician, then at Ulta and have not been able to find it in any retail stores. This is a fantastic gentle peel. It takes some practice, though. You cannot let this product get completely dry and you cannot lather it on thickly. Once you realize the right timing for rubbing it off, you'll love the results. Stay close to the sink because there is a lot of product that comes off, and definitely follow this with a thick warm washcloth.",1
I was excited to try this since it is smudge & waterproof.  It is smudge proof provided it doesn't get wet.  Since it washes off with water if you sweat & rub your eyes off it comes.  Additionally it does nothing in the way of thickening & since it dries quickly you really can't get good lengthening either.  This mascara really does not perform as promised.,0
"I am experienced with makeup having at least 10 years of experience on myself and others, but for some reason, these blushes don't last as long on me as even drugstore brands. I need a cream blush to make these stay, and even then, these emphasize pores and acne, which is crazy because these are matte. I do have oily skin with a solid skin care routine, so the fact these move around so much is disappointing. This color particularly was a different undertone than I was expecting, and is not flattering on my dark tan NC 42 skin, while other light pinks are flattering on me. I would return this, but I can't return it due to Amazon policy, so I will see if I can give these blushes to my sister.",0
"The item pictured is a .4 ounce size but the actual product sent was .21 ounce.  I thought I was getting a larger size and that is why I paid the extra money.  That is not the case.

"I don't know what the deal is, but this isn't the same kind you get from a beauty supply store.... My hair felt so dry.... I gave it a couple weeks and still am disappointed.",0
"I bought this from my local salon.  It smells great, but it never makes me feel clean after. I always have gunky sticky hair with this.  I wouldn't recommend it nor purchase again.

If you like 2nd or 3rd day hair.  This might be for you!",0
"Instead I got a hot pink one with grey lid that says Silk Infusion, but doesn't have the same signature scent that I love. In fact, this version actually stinks to me. I will be on the search for the one i wanted and thought I ordered -  somewhere else in the future.",0
"I don't understand the good reviews here. I owned a Hot Tools titanium curling iron that just went bust on me and thought what can go wrong with getting the same brand. Well...there is a big difference in how this handles compared to the previous one. The clamp handle is high and difficult to push down with one finger as the spring is tough, which leads to jerky hand movements when trying to run this through strands to create a curl. In spite of the strong spring, when you reach the end of your strand one of two things happen: the hair just slides out of clamp and you have to start the curl all over again; or, the hair just snags at the base of the clamp in the spring and you just have to tug and unravel the curl to set it loose and start again.
I got extremely frustrated trying to curl my hair several times and just did not get a good smooth experience. It is heavier than my previous curling iron and more cumbersome to operate. If you are looking for a basic curling iron and don't mind getting clamp creases and having hand cramps from trying to open and close that clamp, only to have your strands sliding out as your trying to get the curl set....then get this one. I will return it and look for another one.",0
Love this product! It works so good. Your pimples and whiteheads will disappear the next day!,1
It's my second one and I love it.  Will never use another brand,1
if you have freckles-it makes them darker,0
I cant write a review because can is broken.  When I went to use it today it doesnt spray out it just pours out of top of sprayer. I guess Ill need to return it.,0
More sheer that appears in pic but still pretty & very natural.  Did 2 coats so next time I will try 3. Lasted almost 2 weeks!  Thrilled and am buying more colors.,1
This can't be Zoya. I got a refund because it was thin (3 coats applied) still wet after 12 hours & chipped the next day! Will buy from Zoya site from now on!!,0
.It made my hair feel like a rats nest after shampooing. Had to use a lot of creme rinse to even it back out. I guess I was expecting a more gentle shampoo for this kind of money. Not happy at all.,0
"I've tried other brands but have found the Toppik brand to work best for me. Although it would be very nice if it could be less messing when applying, I have a white bathroom. All in all, a good product- I don't leave home with out.",1
can't get it to refill.,0
"Perfect love it have two daughters and well it takes so little time to go from wet,wet to dry has some good RPM LOL and then again it isn't that loud eihter so yeah i give it a 5 star and also price not bad compared to other pro ones hope it helps you on your search",1
"The dryer is a nice dryer with good settings of cool shot, warm and hot as well as high and low speeds. The cons are that the handle gets too hot sometimes even after a short while using it. Also the buttons are placed on the handle and it becomes a bit annoying because when holding the dryer you tend to shut them off at times. Cord isn't the greatest. Cord broke as of 9/16/2017 from average use, not even twisting it up around the dryer as most people do. Almost electricuted me while I was drying my hair.",0
Smells and works great,1
"I normally buy this at my salon but I was in a time crunch and reluctantly decided to replace it via Amazon Prime. I love Oribe products and the real version of this conditioner is wonderful. However, what I received in the mail was not the same Oribe that I buy from my salon. At first, it smelled pretty close but after I rinsed the conditioner out of my hair, it smelled like gasoline/metallic. Yuck! It also does not condition- at all!  Don't buy it here. Go to a salon.",0
"Legend Intense hits the nose in a sweet and spicy way that really pleases.  It smells fantastic, especially after the alcohol dissipates and you really can smell the fragrance.  Unfortunately, intense and endurance isn't one and the same because, on me at least, after about four hours it doesn't seem to be...well, intense any more.  You pay a lot more for Jo Malone or Creed fragrances, but I must say they usually have an uncanny way of lasting which for the non-chemist that I am must mean they're more essential oil and less alcohols.  Still, rarely have I smelled anything that I find any better smelling than Mont Blanc Intense.  In fact, spray it on and just see what happens...it's almost comical (in a good way)!.  If it would last a whole day this one would be perfect.",1
"Disappointing Product
Do Not Buy This Product!!!!! I have a small dark spot on the left side on my upper lip and have felt self conscious about it because it wasn't going away after a month. I went to a dermatologist and she told me about this product. I purchased it and it has ruined my life at the moment. My dermatologist told me to only apply it at night because the formula is strong so I applied only a small think layer with a Q-Tip on the dark spot and after it dried I hydrated it. The next morning I woke up with the dark spot soooo DARK. I went to my dermatologist after work and she told me to. It apply it anymore and to let a week go by. However, the spot seems to have turned into a small thin blister and when I went to clean my face with only water a small piece rubbed off and now you can see my flesh. This product has too many things it shouldn't be sold.",0
"Purchased this spray after reading many positive reviews; it had a nice light scent and was generally effective. But it was difficult to get the spray out of the canister. Not sure if this was just a defective item but with no option of return and for the price paid, I wouldn't order this product online again.",0
"I have used Lanza Leave In Conditioner for over 20 years.  I continue to use it because it is the absolute best Leave In Conditioner on the market, and believe me, I have tried every single one you can buy!  You only need a small amount to do the trick.  I have a extremely thick long hair, and I only use an amount slightly larger than a quarter!  Just rub it between my palms, then thru my hair and the tangles immediately come out! There is no heavy residue left in your hair, just soft and manageable. Even though I only wash my hair every 3-4 days, I use it every day as I wet my hair every day to style it. Never does it leave my hair feeling heavy or dull.  Sometimes I even use it as a styling cream. This is the greatest stuff on earth, especially for thick hair that is hard to rinse out cream rinse.  I'm so glad to find it on Amazon, as it is only sold in salon's that sell Lanza products and seems increasingly difficult to find.  If Lanza ever stops making this stuff I'll have to shave my head as nothing else would ever be a good.",1
"oily, smells terrible",0
"If you have thick hair pay the extra $10 for a curling iron that gets hotter. This one doesnt hold the curls for very long. Just traded this one in for the babyliss pro. I'm giving this one away to my sister, who has thinner hair. Hope it works for her!",0
It was not the real stuff I have always used. Very disappointed. Had to throw it away and get the real stuff from the store.,0
"The first time I used this the polish went on perfectly smooth, no lumps.  The second time I used it the color went on all lumpy and gloppy...I hated it so much I took the polish off right then and redid my nails cuz I thought I had done something wrong.  Nope, came out all lumpy & gloppy again.  I read some other reviews where this happened to other people.  I threw the bottle out then.  So I got one good manicure out of it.  Pretty expensive manicure!",0
Great,1
neck wrinkle is lesser,1
I bout this and received it July 13 2017 its no 10/22/2017 and it is broken!! I have never dropped it and it worked until recently I went to charge it and it won't charge its dead I am so disappointed I spent so much on something to have it break not even a year of using it ;(,0
"I love Pur Minerals powder foundation and I was excited to try this one hoping for more full coverage for nights out etc.  I didn't really like this foundation and won't be repurchasing.  It is a strange consistency.  I found that the included puff which looks like a powder puff didn't really do a good job of applying the product to my face.  I immediately switched to a foundation stippling brush.  This did a decent job but the product still seemed a bit dry and not very easy to distribute evenly on my face.  Also, I ordered the color, Light, I normally wear the shade Light in my Pur Minerals 4 in 1 powder foundation and it is the perfect color for my fairly pale skin.  This foundation in Light, however, was too dark for me.  I could possibly wear it now that it is summer but the somewhat thick and dry consistency of the product leaves me not wanting use it.  I wore it out a couple of times.  I did not seem to get a good coverage.  By the time I had it applied, I seemed to have spots with a ton of foundation and other areas with not as much.  It just doesn't go on evenly.  Also, it made me feel like I was wearing foundation.  You know the feeling of stage type cream makeup?  Thats the feeling I had with this on.  This is going in the trash and I'm going back to my powder mineral foundation.",0
"sticky and clumpy, returned it",0
Didn't really do anything.  No curl defining and minimal to nonexistent hold.  The only positive I have is that the scent was nice.,0
I am very happy with this product. I used it to take out the redness when I have my eyebrows  threaded or waxed. It takes the irritation away.,1
"so far it seems to be working. when you buy replacement bulbs, find the ones with double pulses. This unit was chosen for the reviews and the larger working area.",1
"Behalf of my wife Product is not made for Indian skin , it's to much oily whenever  I use this I feel like I got pimples on my face or if I have already then it increase the size of them..",0
It has not met my expectations,0
After doing a considerable amount of research I chose this straightener. VERY happy with the results. I have damage from over processing and getting highlights for years. My hair is medium thin.,1
"The one I received was a cheap knock off. Too bad, guess this is a case of if too good to be true. Returned.",0
"I have hard to manage hair, and this stuff is awesome. It really does add moisture and help smooth it out. It can make your hair to soft, so maybe every other day usage is best.",1
"Light weight, doesn't leave oily residue. Fast shipping",1
I like the smell and it doesn't stain my white clothes with those pit marks. It's not a strong antiperspirant but I think it does its job as a deodorant.,1
quite satisfactory and reasonably priced.,1
"I'd been watching the infomercial with Jane Seymour for quite awhile so I was excited to try this. I've noticed crepey skin in my d&eacute;collet&eacute; area when leaning over. I've used this consistently the past 2 weeks and have noticed no change at all in my skin. This product has an obnoxious scent that makes me cough, is a lot of work that needs to be kept up. I think that my d&eacute;collet&eacute; area looks even drier now than it did when I was using a simple inexpensive facial moisturizer in that area. The same results can probably be obtained by buying a gentle drugstore exfoliator along with a moisturizer for a lot less cost.",0
I like that it is self-contained. I used an old container to store my used blades. The smell is good and it doesn't irritate my face at all.,1
Fairly timely delivery works good according to my wife,1
"You can't beat the ingredients in this formula...it's oh so natural and has nothing remotely toxic in it. However, that plus seems to always come with a price. I have yet to find a natural formula that stays on all day. That said, my eyelids tend to get a little oily, so if you have drier skin on your eyelids, this eyeliner may have better staying power for you.

It glides on nicely and gives you a nice controlled line--from super skinny to thicker, and it smudges well too. The black is nicely pigmented and a good neutral black. However, I found that I had to reapply within a few hours. So I'm definitely going to have to use primer underneath this one, which I prefer not to do (the fewer the products for me, the better). But it's great to know this eyeliner is gentle and even good for my skin. It won't be my go-to, but it's definitely a quality natural eyeliner that's worth trying out if you care about ingredients.",1
"Not even close to making any difference. I think the menthol is added in there to make you think something's happenings, but it's just an ingredient. This product is just crap with a fancy name.",0
"I used this on my lips, cuticles, feet, arms, legs, etc... I've even used a tiny amount to smooth down my after-rain hair frizz. Used it on my nephew's horrible diaper rash and it was like a miracle cure. I used it on my dog's really dry skin with great results. Actually, my dog LOVES this stuff and tries to lick it off of me. I made the mistake of forgetting to put the lid back on one morning, and when I came home, she had licked out all the shea butter. I'm happy to report that she had no gastrointestinal distress from this, thank the lords of kobol. This stuff is so smooth, and a little goes a long way for sure. It leaves a greasy residue on your phone/ipad screen if you use them right after applying this stuff, but it never feels greasy or gross on my skin. I haven't used any other lotion or moisturizer since purchasing this shea butter and I will never go back.",1
"Made my eyes after use ,puffy.",0
"I know this got good reviews but honesty it didn't do much with my hair. It may have lightened the red tone a bit, but after 2 treatments it's not much different.",0
"Is this truely the real product? I used a sample from a salon and thought it to be unreal! But I used this stuff and noticed an odor that I didn't notice to much before from sample.... please is this the real procudt? I spend so much money on my hair to get colored and conditioned I would hate to put some chemical that is not what I purchased, that's fraud.",0
"This is a good curling iron; I have used this brand for many years. It would have been rated great except that the spring does occasionally pop out (after the warranty expires)and contrary to what the description says it is not easy to replace.  You cannot get fingers or tools in the opening to do the job. It is not worth the money to get it repaired professionally.  However, I still buy this product as it really does the job. It usually sells for #36 in beauty supply stores in my area so you save a lot buying on-line.  It is worth it in the long run. I haven't found any other product that works as well as Hot Tools.  Just be aware of the  spring problem.",1
Seems to be alright. I am happy with it :),1
"This goes on very easy; however I have allergies with watering eyes so it is difficult to
find something that stays on for hours.  This is good for the upper lid but I am not
happy with it for the lower lid.",1
My mascara was completely dry. Even rubbing it on my hand hardly made a mark. I would not buy this. I'm returning mine.,0
This is my favorite perfume!  My daughter and I both wear it and love it!  We get compliments all the time but don't like telling anyone what it is because we don't want EVERYONE smelling the same as us!  LOL :D,1
Smells pine and synthetic. House of Burberry has this acent accord that gives me a headache of I smell too long. Ill save for Christmas time and try on a cold day/evening.,0
Good product,1
Smelled OLD and AWFUL,0
Had exacat same experience.,0
"Bought this to replace my Andis dryer that wore out after many years.  This Hot Tools is terrible:  hose is way too short, unit tips over VERY easily, hose attachment is as cheap as it comes - won't stay attached unless you twist the hose before you attach it so it's trying to unwind and is in the bonnet real tight, I have short hair in back so it burns the back of my neck even on low setting - have to use cool setting only - never even got to medium or high. Buying an Andis & putting this one in closet for emergencies.  Will never purchase this brand again.",0
"Purchased for my mother, easy to apply, just the right shade :)",1
"The curling iron fell off of the counter and for one brief quarter of a second, bumped against my right ankle, resulting in second degree burns.  It's been two weeks and the burn is still blistered and trying to heal.  I must say, it curls the hair nicely, but it's not worth the health risks.  Please, be careful!  Pics uploaded in customer images.",0
"I used to love this stuff, but then they doubled the price. NOT HAPPY. I was buying it faithfully every few months and now I will look around for something not so expensive.",0
"When I wear my hair naturally which is curly, it seems to keep it softer and more control.",1
Didn't hold my hair as well as I was hoping.,0
I really wanted to like this product. I use several other Davines products and usually love this product line. The smell is AWFUL and doesn't go away when rinsing.  Although my hair felt great in the shower it was dry and frizzy afterwards. I have long thin hair (mid back) and it was very tangled afterwards as well. I would skip this product and go for the nounou masque instead. It smells and works great.,0
"Since I love Davines Nourishing Shampoo so much, I thought this would be a sure bet. I used it a couple of times, and honestly, I felt like it left my hair feeling worse after than it was before! Might work for others, but I now have an entire jar of this that I will never use.",0
"I received this product in exchange for an honest review.  I think this product is way overpriced for what you get, a very small amount. I think most of the cost is for the case it comes in. This goes on as a gel, and the built in brush is to distribute the gel. The look is ok, but for the money I can find a gel that is a better value.",0
"Not greasy, works great, and smells nice. What else can I say. I do a lot of outdoor work and at the end of the day I look forward to putting this on my hands",1
the product itself is great but it is 1 oz...not 5oz...very misleading...i feel i should be compensated for the other 4 oz.,0
"Whenever I use this product my makeup lasts the entire day!  My trick is, after using moisturizer I spray this on my face, THEN apply my foundation.  I found that applying makeup, and spraying afterwards didn't work as well. ;)",1
"need more slim dispenser on this product than hole bottle at once, yet with a smaller size of application with same economy of scale.",0
"very good,pricy",1
nice deep conditioner,1
no specification that is a travel size,0
Not planning to buy this again.  No hold whatsoever.,0
order goes away fast doesn't lastlong,0
"This is a great idea for reapplying sunscreen; however, the powder goes on very thick, the color is very dark and looks like you over did it with facial bronzer.  Also, it dumps out lots of powder when you apply it and I ended up with tan colored powder all over my clothes.  Might be good in a translucent color, but I still think there were will be more powder on my clothes than my face.  Too much product waste for the money.",0
Has weird scent,0
So disappointed in this polish.  It says apply two thin coats.  I have applied three and I still have brush marks and spotty coverage. It definitely doesn't look like a gel polish.  I went out and bought a cheap drug store variety and it has much better coverage.  I am not sure this is really OPI.  Beware!!,0
"I've tried several different primers over the years and until I came across this one none delivered what it promised...
This one does! It's silicon free and keeps your face shine free for hours & makes your makeup look good & fresh all day long.
Highly recommend!!!",1
"There's nothing blissful or particularly poetic about my experience with Bliss' blue wax extravaganza. Melting the wax is relatively easy, albeit time consuming and gooey. Applying the wax is simple but messy. Ripping patches of blue wax off? You have to scratch enough of the wax up to get a good grip before yanking the hairs out. Oh, you want to remove all the hair simultaneously? Good luck! Because it won't happen. Rogue hairs will remain amidst the bald patches. Then what? Do you shave? Tweeze? Apply more wax? The only certainty: you won't win. Particularly irksome are the thin patches of blue sludge that need to be picked at like a four day old scab. Pick, pick, pick. Scratch, scratch, scratch. Your skin will be pink and grumpy. An hour after waxing my leg is still tingling with hot rage. I managed to do about 1/4 of my calf before giving up.

Side note: Everything in this kit smells like roses- but not in a good way. If President Snow's genetically engineered roses were a real thing, they would smell just like this wax.",0
Love this fragrance its smooth and a soft sent,1
I purchased this product hoping to be able to reduce my colorings.  I didn't find it easy to apply.  It is sticky and I would want to wash my hair everyday after using this product.  In the summer at my employment it is quite warm.  I was concerned that it may melt and drip.  I think I would be more likely to use this product on my eyebrows than on my hair.  I would use it in an emergency if I had a special engagement.,0
"I love this hair conditioner. My hair is soft and shiny and maintains body throughout the day. A dime size amount is all it takes, and it is gentle on color treated hair as well.",1
This face wash is a great manly product. Keeps your skin clean and non-oily. Came across this brand while working at the Hard Rock of all places! Guys have to get it! Great price too.,1
Developed a reaction to this product within a week of use,0
"Not the best smelling soap, but I love using it for my sensitive skin.",1
"I was not impressed with this product at all.  I would not purchase it again. I have some sun spots I was hoping it would cover , but did not work unless I caked it on.",0
"This is my favorite lip balm, my husband loves it too! It heals chapped lips faster than any other product I've tried and it's long lasting. It's not sticky, and it feels amazing on my lips. I've bought several tubes over the years for my husband and myself. 100% recommend.",1

Smells so good!,1
"I used my friends rod several times before finally splurging to get my own. I read the reviews about it not getting hot anymore after just a few months but knew my friend had hers for years, so figured that was just the rare occurrence. Nope, after 7 months and maybe 20-25 uses, it got cold in the middle of me doing my hair and hasn't gotten hot since. I registered my rod and have contacted customer support before writing this review, but have yet to hear back.",0
"When I first heard about these products, I though that they were just water in a spray can.  But after trying it, I now realize that it is so much more than that.  This Avene Thermal Spring Water is now one of my staples.  I have dry skin that is prone to irritation.  This product is intended for sensitive skin and has not caused any irritation.  It leaves my skin soft and supple.  This spray bottle releases a fine mist of the spring water which is full of minerals.  I use it both before and after moisturizing, and sometimes during my day just as a refresher.  Before using moisturizer, I spritz with this spray just to moisten my face a little and then add my moisturizer.  I find that it helps my moisturizer to penetrate a little better.",1
This was a gift  was a reasonable price and shipped really fast good product. It's smells wonderful  love it it,1
"Box was torn open. Haven't tried it yet but it seemed used...

Update: the tan is somewhat ""orangy"" which is not an excellent color. Wouldn't buy it again.",0
Doesn't last long. Need to spray again in the afternoon,0
"This shaving cream is the best!  It give my husband a fabulous, smooth shave...and no problem for his sensitive skin.  The whole line of The Art of Shaving is wonderful.",1
"I didn't expect much and I got less than expected.
Just hype for sagging skin.  Used another product and see excellent results.  You get what you pay for.",0
This is not the hydra source conditioner I have purchased in the past. It may still be a Biolage product but not the one that should be in this bottle.,0
Too expensive and no better than a .50 tube of lip gloss,0
"I am still losing my hair, but at the same time I see growth. It is about a month that I have been using it!",0
Best body bronzer! Smells great and is streak free!,1

"After a year of flawless use the threaded post that screws into handle snapped clean off in mid shaving stroke. Unfortunately when I tried to contact anyone (merkur) to see if the part could be replaced they kept claiming that the water or soap I used may have eroded the metal, not the best endorsement for their product.",0
The best sunscreen/cover up there is! I love it. I combine the fair and medium colors because I'm somewhere in between.,1

Love it!,1
I recieved a sample of this after a facial.  It is 78.00 dollars in salons and other web sites!!!!! Super moisturizer but Can be a little heavy.  It sinks right into your skin and leaves your face soft and well moisturizer.  4 stars because I did have 1 or 2 pimples pop up and I have never had any issues with pimples.  I am 48.  I was using the moisturizer 2 x a day but cut it to 1 x daily and it's fine.  Lasts a good 2-3 months.,1
"The Nioxin System seems to work for my mom.  She says, that she is not loosing as much hair and the hair seems stronger and thicker.",1
Still snags a bit but has made a huge difference in the flow of my hair.  I have wavy hair that turns curly in humidity,1
"I'm a professional hairdresser, and this is NOT a professional product.  Though lightweight, it feels cheap. The cord is quite short, and the motor is EXTREMELY LOUD.",0
"I am not giving this 5 stars for only one reason....it was way too dark for my skin.  That is not the fault of La Roche-Posay but is entirely the fault of me choosing the wrong color.  I just wanted to bring to others the fact that the dark beige is really dark.  I am a senior citizen with silver hair but I was so anxious to try this I didn't pay enough attention.

I recently fell and bruised my arm, very dark bruise, in fact.  I figured I would try it on that bruise since it was too dark for my face.  Covered the bruise just fine, still darker than my skin but better than purple.  The concealer itself seemed a little pricey but I went ahead and ordered the ""Light Beige"" and hope it comes soon.  The pen is small but easy to work.  How much is actually inside the pen is anybody's guess.  After I try the lighter color, I shall come back and revise this review.  I feel sure, though, that the other will work fine.",1
"Meh. There is nothing special about this curling iron, but it works fine. What I don't like that there is a red light on when it's plugged in (when it's turned off), and what I REALLY don't like it the annoying wire stand. The better models have a solid built in piece set back from the barrel that holds it off the counter - so you don't have to move it to curl your hair or to set it down again. Would not purchase anything with this kind of stand again.",0
"I've been using this ""body polish""  for a week or so and I can report that it does a fair job smoothing and moisturizing the skin.  I have mostly used it on my neck and decolletage, as well as my arms.  While I don't  have thin crepe-like skin, I did find this product to make a positive difference in the texture and hydration of my skin in these areas.  Everything feels softer and smoother.  I'm rather impressed by the difference, actually.  Every thing is much more touchable - softer - and yes, even polished.  I haven't experienced any redness or irritation from frequent use.

It's easy to dispense too much.  The formulation is on the thin side and you don't need a large amount to cover the areas I mentioned.  Since it's a rather costly investment, I would suggest experimenting with smaller amounts to find your ideal application.  The fragrance is a very pleasant citrus that doesn't linger.

It's almost beach season here in NWFL.  After a very short winter, I'm ready to get a pedicure and go out and enjoy the sunshine.  This smoothing polish is just the thing to wake up the skin on my legs and feet.  It doesn't take daily use to get results.  A few consecutive days of use jump started my skin and now a bit of maintenance once or twice a week is all I really need.",1
"Had to return this one. If you are getting an Elchim, make sure u get one that is ""high pressure.",0
Oh so pretty,1
"This is not an authentic Davines product. Packaging is exact but if you have ever had the real deal Davines Nounou you will know the difference after use. This product is lighter in color, not as thick and smells real at first sniff (real Nounou has a very strong perfume musk fragrance) but then smells like harsh chemicals after you massage it in and rinse. After first use I noticed from the chemical smell it wasn't real Davines product. Unfortunately I had to use it for a few days until my order came from the Davines website. After a week of use I noticed when brushing my hair out after use, there was a lot more hair in the brush. It caused a noticeable amount if gair loss for me. I had a real Davines container so I compared the ingredients. Identical except for ""Creatine"" is an ingredient in the fake...which can cause hair loss. Don't be fooled by the decent price and fast shipping...spend the extra 6 dollars and get the real product.",0
good product,1
"Doesn't do much, but it smells good, and moisturises my skin quite nicely.",1
If you're new to DE shaving try a variety of blades.  These are alright for a beginner who is afraid of slicing their face up but after the first few shaves you can tell the are middle of the road blades and the amazon price is a bit steep compared to what you can find on shaving supply websites.  Each face and safety razor will have it's own blade.  2 star rating more because of the price (especially if you include shipping!).,0
"Love the color. Beautiful nude with a slight pinkish tint. The polish is a but in the thicker side, so it tends to streak a bit. Two coats usually takes care of it though.",1
Love this! My face feels and clean doesn't make me break out. I have very sensitive skin! Really love it!,1
"didnt' work at all
battery got stuck in side",0
Like this new design,1
"I've been using this mascara for a long time, and it's great, but the one I ordered here was defective, the brush fell off inside the mascara and I cannot get it out.  Trying to figure out how to return it.",0
"WOW!  I keep hearing how fabulous Seche Vite is, but honestly, I don't want to deal with the shrinkage issue, plus, it has to be applied to wet nails.  So, when I read a review of CND Super Shiny, I ordered it immediately - and took a chance on the larger size.  This stuff is awesome!  I actually just couldn't 't wait for my order to arrive from Amazon,so I found CND at Ulta (smaller size), and hurried home to apply to my two day old home mani.  It was a frosted bronze polish, and I had applied gold glitter on the tips.  OMG!  The CND Super Shiny absolutely made the glitter tips just pop, it was stunning.  I literally could not stop looking at my nails with this topcoat on.  And in the sunlight, all I can say is BUY this now!!!!!! You will not be disappointed.  Today I redid my nails with a blue glitter (Across the Universe), and it's beautiful, but the CND Super Shiny just makes every little piece of glitter sparkle.  And unlike SV, this topcoat can be reapplied to freshen up your nails.  I'm in heaven.  Super glossy, goes on smoothly, not too strong smelling, performs just as promised.  It is NOT quick drying, but I always use a low setting on an old blow dryer, and have yet to ruin my nails with any smudging, etc.

Again, this topcoat is perfect!  In the past I had used SH Big Shiny Topcoat (very good) and also had OPI topcoat recommended to me, which was just okay.  But the CND knocks out any other contenders.  Try it, I don't think you will be disappointed.  Also, I experienced NO chips with it, but again, I did have glitter on my nail tips, so that could have helped not make any chips as noticeable, if they existed.  I LOVE the shine it gives.  Now, I can't wait to try it over a black polish, Licorice, but find that I can't get off the glitter polishes!!!!!",1

Exactly what I wanted,1
It doesn't really keep the color on your lips. All stains kind of dry out your lips but this really dries your lips.,0
Worth the Money....perfect for the pre-shave lather up and go. Smells great...just don't get it in your eye...ooch.,1
Love the product but the light brown side crumbled in my makeup drawer in less than two weeks. It was expensive and I won't buy it again. Too bad I love the product but it turned into powder.,0

"After dealing with one too many flimsy nail clipper that would bend or leave a ragged nail edge, I decided it was time to get a clipper that was well-constructed and would retain its edge. The Henckels Ultra-Slim Nail Clipper fits that bill perfectly. It is very well engineered with few parts, solid steel, and great fit and finish. It is sharp enough that it leaves a clean nail edge without any additional filing. It looks stylish (strange as that may be to say about nail clippers) and also fold down to a ridiculously small size with the cutting edge safely closed.

The folding mechanism is clever although I initially didn't realize how it worked. My first attempt at cutting resulted in scoring rather than cutting. Then I realized that you need to open the clipper and push the top into place. Once engaged properly, the cutting action is quite solid.

Aside from my own user error, I only have two minor issues. First, the file is pretty useless. Fortunately, it's really unnecessary so it's not a big deal. Second, the spring action that opens that cutting edges is compressed when the clipper is folded (stored) and I worry it may fail or weaken over time. Again, probably not something I really have to worry about, but someone who's had it longer may be able to chime in.

Minor nitpicks aside, I am very satisfied with this clipper and were I to lose them, I would get the same one. It provides a clean cut in a well engineered, compact form factor.",1
Good for all hair types,1
"Love it, love it!!!! Its my go to hot tool. Its perfect for everyday use whether you are looking to create a fun style or if you just need to quickly straighten your hair.",1
love this,1
Works great! Very light but effective!,1
"If you are looking for shave cream this is not It,
I opened the jar and it was like plaster & all dried out.
Apparently this was a reject from Italy so they sent it to the good old USA where I had to remove it and mix it with water like I was making chip dip.",0
Stopped working. Lights go on. Doesn't work.,0
"I'm the type of person where my manicure chips in less than 24 hours. I'm going on 4 days and they still look great. I was very careful not to get any on my skin when polishing, and I think this may help. I love this color...it's a great staple color for winter.",1
"I'm using a number of therapies (along with jessner's peels, exfoliation, brightening serum, etc.) to minimize a large patch of hyperpigmentation on my forehead, and this seems to be helping speed along the process.

I feel like the change has been more dramatic after getting this product than before.",1
A must for me,1
Great setting spray! Does not water my makeup!,1
"I bought this item Sept 12 2014 it's Nov 19 and the tip has broke off and I can't return the item. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!
Do not buy this is junk!",0
Great price!!!,1
Terrible product; greesy and a complete waste of money. I don't recommend it at all.,0
I'm not even sure what I recieved is the real thing or a fake. It doesn't get very hot and takes forever to blow dry. It does the same job as a blow dryer from cvs. Go to a shop and buy it so you know exactly what your getting. My blowdryer says made in Italy and the cord says China used it for months and all it did was make my hair look frizzy. I bought a baby pro ceramic and such a diffrence it made. I do not recommend this junk . Waste of money,0
"It's a great product, we have used it for years",1
"This product did not work for me at all. I have long hair and hoped that I could have that slick straight salon hair results with this. Unfortunately,  the brush was disappointing. it just didn't do much for me. I was able to straighten my hair but it still looked puffy no matter how many times I went over the same strand of hair.  I had to return it for the amount of money it costs. I purchased another product which I am liking and I can straighten my hair right out of the shower and it cost less!

"New out of the box and the power indicator light does not work. The iron did begin to heat, which is quite dangerous as it is not possible to tell by looking at it whether it is on or not. It has the feel of a cheap knock off of a salon quality iron, and given the price I guess that should have been obvious. At least Amazon makes the return process relatively painless.",0
This product is really awful.  The wells are TINY - you could maybe use them for lipstick but I'm not sure if a full tube would fit.  The middle divider ripped within 2 minutes of use.  The palette is super messy and doesn't close fully.  Amazon gave me a really tough time about returning it as well.  Don't bother!,0
This is amazing - it really covers well without feeling sticky or heavy. Easy to apply.,1
"Sadly, I have to join the dissenters who HATE this product. Not because of the texture (it's an OIL, I expected it to be OILY) or the amount of sun protection, but because of the horrible allergic reaction I had to the product. I do not have sensitive skin, and this is the only product I have EVER had a reaction to. I sprayed it on my arms, chest, upper back, and rubbed some onto the back of my neck and up behind my ears (places I get incidental sun but don't use my regular face & neck sunscreen on), and within 24 hours I was covered in tiny itchy red bumps.

I used more of the product on my arms than anywhere else, and while the rash on the other areas hardly itched at all and the bumps were very small, on my arms they ranged from tiny spider-bite sized bumps to large hives, and itched so terribly I was ready to tear my skin off. OTC topical treatments didn't help (cortisone cream, oatmeal baths, etc.), and after nearly 2 weeks I was ready to suck it up and go to the dermatologist (I only put it off b/c I really can't afford it) when it finally started to clear up. Another week or so later and the active rash is gone, but my arms are now covered in spots that are scarring and I still have itching. Closest thing I can compare this to was having chicken pox as a kid, but luckily this was concentrated mostly on my arms - I may have literally gone insane if I'd had it all over.

I have not been able to determine what ingredient caused the reaction, as I have used all the active sunscreen ingredients in this product before - in fact, I have tried every other product in the Supergoop line with no reaction whatsoever, and my daily face sunscreen is the City Serum which I LOVE. None of the inactive ingredients jumped out as something that would cause any irritation, either, and most of them were things I know I've used before. If I ever get insurance that actually has decent coverage for a derm visit, I'll bring it in and see if my doctor can figure it out.

Since most of the reviews for this product are favorable, I would just warn that if you do try this product, be VERY cautious and do a small test patch BEFORE applying the product to a larger area. My second biggest regret (first is getting anywhere near the product) is that I didn't take pictures of the different stages of the reaction to send to the company, as I think they should definitely be aware of what an allergic reaction to this product can do to the skin. Being very fair, the scars dotting both arms are extremely obvious, especially since they're accompanied by hyperpigmentation, and will probably require several chemical peels to diminish them as they could take years to completely fade on their own. Luckily, fall is on it's way, since being unable to wear short sleeves in the 90+ degree heat is not exactly pleasant, either.",0
It has flattened my hair and seems leave my perm less curly. I prefer Pantene over this product. I use it on my dogs now just to use it up didn't want to throw it away because it's so expensive.,0
"I love love this product . But what happened!??
The formula has totally changed . It used to smell so good and was great for my sensitive skin. I just received my item a few minutes ago. Sprayed it once. My face is now irritated  not to mention it smells completely horrible . I never leave bad reviews but if I could I would give it 0 stars:/",0
Product came leaking and the product is still in plastic.,0
This worked extremely well. I purchased for a trip to Disneyland and it did the trick. I have extremely sensitive skin because of health issues. So was great to reapply sunscreen on my face over my makeup after my original sunscreen wore off. It has a light fragrance but mild to me and Im sensitive to smells. A great purchase.,1
"This has a light, pleasant scent that is perfect for applying right out of the shower, and the scent lasts for quite a while. My son really likes the scent and the large bottle size makes it a good value for the price.",1
Good product. Keeps it under control and not too drying. Just don't go changing the formulation!,1
I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS HAIR STRAIGHTENER AT ALL. I GOING BACK TO MY CHI.  It lasted for over a year,0
This lip balm felt sort of weird and waxy to me.  Nice mint tingle but I returned it.,0
"After I sprayed the product, my hair was full of little dandruff like particles.",0
"love it ,first got it in Dr,""S  office  at a much higher cost  . It is light ,cleans all your make up plus eye without  burning .",1
This was purchased as a birthday gift.  My best friend received it and told me one of the rubber stoppers from one of the bottles of perfume was removed and the entire bottle was empty.  She believes the bottle was tampered with prior to shipment because all the other bottles were in tact.,0
"Wish I had known this product only works on dark hair prior to using it.

Also, DO NOT USE ON TATTOOS! It burns like a sonuvagun!!",0
This the best product I have ever used. I will continue to buy this product as well as recommend it to my friends.,1
I have used the old formula in the gray and purple tube for years. This new formula with keratin in the black tube makes my hair feel and look too stiff.,0
Love this Shampoo and conditioner.  The mint tingles on my scalp and the packaging is great and very user friendly.,1
Product changed after in used it the old way for years.,0
"I've heard very good things about this brand, and was excited to try this cleanser. I'm at the nuisance age of enjoying periodic acne along with mild wrinkles, so I keep looking for solutions for the former that don't exacerbate the latter (dry skin makes the wrinkles look worse, for those not yet familiar with the pattern). This cleanser is not going to stay in my arsenal.

Pros:
1. Only need to use a small amount, which should make the very small bottle last longer
2. Rinses clean, without residue
3. Doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin
4. Doesn't seem to strip my skin, but leaves it feeling clean
5. Doesn't dry my skin to make the wrinkles look worse

Cons:
1. Doesn't do much other than clean. I didn't notice any effect other than the mental one from the ""cooling action"" of the menthol. I got zero benefit from using this other than the ""cleansing"" part.
2. Not suitable for removing makeup. This is definitely a cleanser to be used strictly for a makeup-free face. Even when I used it after removing my makeup (with Neutrogena wipes, which are the best I've found so far), I still needed another cleanser for traces of eye makeup since I'm not putting menthol around my eyes.
3. Doesn't foam. It's more of a watery gel, like inexpensive liquid hand soap. That means it's also kind of runny, so applying it in the shower meant it ran into my eyes if I wasn't careful. Note that this is only because I let it sit on my skin for several seconds to try to get some benefit from the salicylic acid. This approach is NOT suggested on the packaging, so I can't fault Obagi for it. I do wish it had a thicker consistency, though, so the salicylic acid could sit and have time to do something.
4. Expensive. Considering the tiny bottle size and minimal effects (and the need for something else to remove makeup), the price tag seems very high. I've used drug store cleansers that were on par with this one for a fraction of the cost. If I'm spending more, I'd rather invest in Algenist or La Mer cleansers, which don't claim to do anything for acne, but do clean my skin beautifully (including eye makeup).

Overall, I'm sad to say I can't recommend this cleanser.",0
Only lotion my hubby will use.  He loves it!,1
"This goes on easily and smooth.  The pump gives you the ability to control the amount dispensed.  My face feels hydrated and since it has an SPR of 25, I am not worried about sun aging.  The only issue I have is it is a bit pricy.",1
"Love this organic natural lip color.  I like to keep my makeup very natural looking and go for the very natural looking lip colors.  This is a pink color, I add their gloss over it.  What I do love is how conditioned my lips feel when using this, and it stays for a long time- which is hard to find in a product that isn't a stain.  Most important is this makeup is natural- what we put on our skin is very important and so I'm now using all natural organic products on the skin, as well as what I eat!

Love this lip color- and you will too!",1
"I really wanted this to work. I'm fair with dark hair, so the perfect candidate (I thought). I used the setting on max & barely felt any pain. At the same time I bought this, I also started getting professional laser removal on my bikini, underarms & legs (which is REALLY expensive -- but is working). I bought this to see if I could achieve similar results & same some $$ for my arms. Alas, it didn't work for me. FULL DISCLOSURE - I did not follow the instructions perfectly - so this may work for you. Also, everyone's hair/skin is different -- so you can give it a try. But I think to avoid lawsuits, the company has it at a really low power-setting (the professional ones really hurt, cause skin irritation & probably can permanently scar you). This device takes a lot of time, doesn't hurt your skin at all & doesn't seem to really impact the body hair either.

It is almost impossible to cover a large area with the device because its aperture is so small -- so I figured I would concentrate on 3 dark, thick hairs on my neck and chin. I zapped and zapped and zapped several times in a session, multiple times in a week, and several weeks in a row for months (this use is NOT per instructions - you are supposed to treat 1x every 2 weeks - and I also plucked them out after the zapping because it would drive me nuts to have those hairs on my face (which is also against instructions)). What I achieved was a slowing of growth of those hairs + they got somewhat finer. I haven't seen any difference in the hair on my arms (but I wasn't a precision user to cover the area perfectly & I can't say I did it with the same amount of frequency/ferocity as with the hairs on my chin). I wasn't expecting great results -- but I was hoping to achieve some thinning of hair on my arms & permanent removal of the hairs on my face/neck. I could have justified the expense if it got rid of the dark hairs on my face, but I can't recommend this product given my outcome.

This is a 2-star review, not a 1-star review because I didn't follow the instructions. But I don't think many people do - so I'm not willing to give it a 3-star either. I also wish I had read a review like this in the first place, because I think I wasted my money on this product (which I will still be using in the hope that with repeated zapping, I can at least get rid of these three hairs. If I ever do, I will update this review & will give it another star). Hope springs eternal!",0
"Did not make a difference for my natural hair. Wanted to like it, but did not really see a change.",0
"I was really disappointed in the color of this polish.  It doesn't look anything in real life like it did on the computer.  The other two colors I ordered were much closer to what was depicted, and to what I wanted.  I don't know if there's a way to exchange it or not.",0
"I have used this product for several years due to the hold and the lack of scent, but recently I have had problems with the spray nozzle and the cost is getting prohibitive. I am searching for an alternative.",1
"I bought this lip gloss looking for something that would last as long as a lip stain. The application isn't that bad (twist and wait), and the taste isn't bad, but as soon as I put it on, it's gone 30 minutes later. I put it on and it's goopy and sticky because it's a gloss, but after I wait for it to set, it still comes off within 30 minutes. And I'm not obsessively licking or chewing my lips or anything! Honestly, both cheap lipstick and lipstain from the drugstore last 10 times as long as this (and are MUCH cheaper.) Don't waste your time with this. It doesn't last and I find it ridiculously expensive.",0
Barely any product on the bruch.  And if it gets in your eye it is amazingly painful.  Waste of money,0
Works well on redness due to rosacea.,1
"I really like this product. It makes my skin glow & appears to plump or soften my eye lines. Con: face may look greasy with too much, does not tighten skin, & sun block percentage very low.",1
I ordered 2 of the OP! nail polish but only received one. Please ship the other one very soon. Thank you,1
Makes your eyelashes crunchy. Had to apply mascara when they are stiff,0
Good.,1
"This is one of the best mascaras available. It goes on beautifully, never clumps, thickens without making lashes spikey. The agate brown color is a rich true brown, not blackish, which works great for color enhancement. One application works well but a second one goes on fine without the caking that a lot of brands create. A quality product. No hype, just delivers.",1
The holder is different and a cheap one that keeps coming out.......Bronzer is OK....,0
Product doesn't smell so great.,0
to thick paste ??,0
I was not pleased with Dermablend loose powder. It is lacked for light and fair complexion but the color is to dark for my light complexion. Also I find it does not cover as stated yet it is more expensive than most loose powders.,0
This tan mitt does not protect hands from self tan lotion staining. It does work to smooth out the lotion if you wear plastic gloves and have already put on the lotion and rubbed it in first.,0
This is my absolute favorite OPI color. Glad it is no longer discontinued.,1
Doesn't work as well as the one I bought in the salon.,0
Helps and seems to be a good product. Not overly harsh on the skin.,1
Cannot compare to eff ctven as of Latisse.,0
Fast delivery. I Love this perfume but I'm wondering if the Company changed it's scent..it doesn't smell like before this was my number 1 perfume. It has absolutely no staying power. Maybe I got a bad batch.,0
"I used to buy the previous version of this product that was in a white jar. The pads in the current jar are too dry. They aren't wet, but damp. UPDATE: only the first couple of pads were drier. The rest are as normal.",1
"I have thick hair that tends to frizz and pouf up with humidity. I prefer using a cream to sprays when styling but many creams leave a shiny gel like finish which I dislike. I've used this cream on wet and dry hair and it has performed well in both situations.

The Obliphica gives you a gentle hold with a lot of bounce still left. While it has a very light hold, it does make a big difference.  It adds a light sheen to your hair but does not look greasy by the end of the day. It is lightly scented but it is not a strong fragrance and I did not find it bothersome.

The cream is, oddly enough, orange! But it works well at reducing frizz, does not weigh down the hair or leave noticeable residue and so I am quite happy with it.",1

I really love this primer for giving me an overall smooth surface to work with and it also fills in my pores a bit!,1
I think this is for young children. Not for people with thick hair. Can barely wrap around twice with my thick hair. If your pony tail is the width of a coin then this is for you. My pony tail is the width of a toilet paper roll so it's needs something sturdier. This product was not for me.,0
Really liked this product.,1
This is almost magical i cant believe how this fits me.,1
I work on Cruise Ship and we have a duty free shop and they sell this perfume also but its bit expensive then amazon.

I do not know if it is really old stock or what ? but i am not satisfy with this product.,0

Excellent subdued color and OPI quality.,1

"I decided to get into wet shaving in efforts to reduce shaving irritation, save money and because I like doing things the ""old fashioned"" way even as a young person. This is my first DE razor, and I couldn't be more pleased. There are adjustments you must make in your technique if you are new to DE razors or nicks will happen. However, this is an easy razor to get used to. This is a quality made product, and I feel it will last many years if properly taken care of. It is machined well, and the fit and finish is excellent. The long handle makes it easy to hold, even with wet hands. It is very heavy, which makes shaving easier. The only negative I can find is the handle. It is plastic, although it looks heavy and durable. I thought it was some type of finished metal, like anodized aluminum. That is very picky and doesn't affect the shave quality at all. I have a fairly heavy beard, and have routinely put off shaving because I hate(d) it so much. This razor changed all of that, because of the superior shave and the satisfaction of a job well done. I would recommend this to anyone who is a DE razor beginner or seasoned veteran.

Update: After closer inspection, I saw that I was wrong about the handle. It is indeed metal, I assume steel albeit finished so well that it is hard to tell unless you look close enough to see the ""MERKUR"" roll marked into it.",1
Use it everyday and it replaced my hair breaking gel! My hair is thinning and it's an awesome alternative!,1
First one I received came completely in pieces but I sent it back and got a new one very easily and very fast. The new one works great!,1
"This is my first time using this sunscreen and even tinted sunscreen. It is not thick lotion, and a little seems to go a long way. I've been using it for about a month now and I find myself mixing it with regular face sunscreen to lessen the tint. I personally don't think I like tinted sunscreen. Note that I am very pale. Next I will buy Image without the tint!",1
Smells so unique,1
"This soap has a good lather.  It is not as rich as TABAC.  Maybe a little less rich than MWF.  I really like the scent.  I switched to this away from Proraso's traditional scent.  I do not care for the new formulation.  The sandalwood scent stays on all day which is good if you like it, but not if you do not enjoy it.  The scent is not overpowering.  Much better lather than any of the glycerin soaps.  I like to switch soaps from day to day.  This is in my regular rotation.",1
"Had it for a couple of months.  It was great, then stopped working.  Liquid stopped coming out. Very disappointing.",0
Review is for mix up in delivery product is great,0
"I had used this product the first time after purchasing it at Costco a year or so ago.  It's no longer carried there, of course, so I found a close-enough replacement at Amazon.  A couple of reviewers mentioned how difficult it is to open, and that's correct. To open it, you have to push the button on the bottom front of the case, while finding the narrow opening (a mere crack) in which you can wedge a fingernail and pull up. It should have been designed to pop open when you push the button or have a small bump on the top half to push up on while pushing down on the button to release the lid. The material the compact is made of looks cheap too.  I will continue to use the bronzer, though, because the product inside is excellent.",1
This is my everyday hand cream. Great brand and great quality. My hands are always dry and this cream helps a lot. I love the fact that it is not tested on animals and uses good ingredients. I worked at the manufacturing plant in France for a while and they make awesome products !,1
