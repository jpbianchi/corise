review,label
very smooth over a moisturizer. I like the coverage.,1
Noticeable improvement to how my hair looks after a month+ of use. I am in my late 20's and my hair began to thin a bit. Using this cleanser has helped.,1
"no doubt the best thing I have used on my thick colored dry hair. winter dry hair is no longer a problem, no more tons of conditioner and running out of hot water trying to get it out. the spray treatment it the best way to apply too.",1
"I have used Surface Trinity Protein Cream on my hair for several years.  I find it really helps to keep my frizzy hair under better control than other products I have used (note that it is not a miracle product).  This cream also keeps your hair soft, not stiff like other control products.  If your hair needs a little help later in the day, just spray it with water and the product keeps working.  I find the cream too thick so I add water (1 part water to one part cream) and mix in a separate pump bottle (a small hand soap pump bottle).",1
The nail polish remover does not remove the Lacquer nails as easily as it says. I still had to let the sides lift and scrape it off.,1
returned,0
Perfect,1
This travel size dryer is powerful and the flat iron really works! I have tried other small flat irons and they just haven't gotten hot. This one does.,1
Not really a clarifying shampoo which the name made me think it was :(. I also didn't care for the scent. I oredered Rusk Clarity (or clarify-light purple color) and loved it!,0
Love this straightener!  Has many heat settings and is easy to handle.,1
"When you find your skin dull and lifeless, pull out this handy little piece of makeup, which will brighten and lighten the skin around the eyes. Recommended!",1
Seller changed package.  The cost is the same or more yet there is much less powder.,0
"I like Biolage products they work great. This isn't what I really wanted. I wanted the conditioner that you leave in your hair.
This conditioner works great.",1
"I just tried this once, but it seems to be a great fragrance per that first time that I tried it.",1
My nails chipped more while using this. Disappointing.,0
"This product was theoretically supposed to replace the original Fioravanti vinegar rinse. Why, oh why did they feel the need to change something that was such a great product?",0
An estatician recommended this product.  I feel it is worth having.  I was glad to be able to purchase it through Amazon.,1
Im not a pro.  It does the job for me.,1
I love this mask! It makes my skin feel super soft and doesn't seem to cause any breakouts or irritation after.,1
"I'm giving it 2 stars since when it worked it did a pretty good job. My skin felt really soft and somewhat youthful after inconsistent use. However, in the middle of a session, I was done with the right side of my face when the suction just gave out. I looked online on how to trouble and nothing. I got about 10 uses of this gadget and now it's garbage. Now I'm left is an undone face and out $90.",0
did not do any thing for me don't see the difference.,0
"It's not like the same bottle I previously purchased from my salon. I don't want to say it's fake, but don't waste your money as it's not the same thing I've used before.",0
Excelent product,1
I really like the product - my doctor suggested it.  I have very sensitive skin - allergic to  everything it seems.  It covers well without being too heavy. I was concerned since only two tints were available but it blends tight in.  I even have oily skin and it does fine.,1
"I unfortunately saw the hype around this product and fell for it. My favorite glam gurus used it and loved it. They spoke so highly of this product. But when I bought it and used it the first time, it was nice. But its been almost 2 weeks(i know, I really wanted to make this product work for me ) and my face is breaking out, and it doesnt break out. Im breaking out on places on my face that I never break out on, my skin is itchy and dry and really irritated. I slowly introduced this to my skin care routine. I even thought that at one point maybe the ingredients in my regular routine just don't work with this. I had patience and  utilized the internet to see what I could do. And alas nothing helpful, and nothing good and my face got worse. I would like to make it clear that I do not have sensitive skin. Do your research about this brand before buying. Just because it failed for me, doesnt mean itll fail for you. But to be fair I have it a chance I really tried but this brand failed. The ingredients are the best quality of what they could be. And I just don't trust it. You can buy something much for gentler and kinder to your face for cheap, do not use this.",0
"I am not sure how they use it in face. I have read it online that this will help to reduce Keratosis pilaris (chicken skin) in my under arms. After using this for a week my skin feel like burning. I have stopped it two days then start using it. After 2nd week I can see there are burned spots in my arms. I have completely stopped using it. The burning got worest , now it is black under my arms , it looks and  feel like burned skin!",0
Just start to use.,1
Doesn't stay on,0
I have been wearing this perfume for 10 years or more and this is not the real deal and is not returnable. I trusted that if I bought from Amazon (and not the marketplace) that it would be real. I would not recommend buying this item from Amazon.,0
"Loved it, but it quit working after 5 months.",0
I have long lashes but they are relatively sparse.  I heard wonderful things about this mascara so I ordered it.  I like the way that it is applied in tubes however it did not give me any type of volume that I am looking for. I'll stick to my cheapo L'Oral and maybelleine.,0
"I bought this shade instead of the normal colorless one, since the price was significantly better. This was a bit darker in real life than I believed it would be based on amazon's picture, so that was somewhat disappointing (I am very fair). However, I am making this work by mixing it with another colorless powder.",1
Waste of money.,0
Used repeatedly and per instructions experienced some of what instructions conveyed I might.  Did not work,0
I gave one star cause I can not give ZERO! These things will last 6 months IF your lucky. I have sent this thing in so many times to get fixed I lost count. If your a stylist you will struggle with how short the cord is. Only good thing about the dryer is that it is light weight. That's maybe because the dryer was made out of Popsicle sticks and rice paper. Ok maybe that is a little bit of an exaggeration.,0
"This stuff is AMAZING. It is a little pricey at $15-$20 per .20oz tube, but it lasts forever... I have two tubes, one from 2014 (that I still haven't used up yet in 2017) that I keep in my car, and a newer tube that I keep in my wallet... one application lasts forever as it goes on thick and doesn't come off when eating, absent-mindlessly licking your lips, drinking, etc. I have oily skin and find that sometimes lip balms kind of leach out & make the areas around my lips/chin very greasy looking - this does NOT. The smell is lovely - not overpowering and doesn't make you feel like a 5yr old with a flavored lip smackers. It makes my lips SO SOFT and is a life saver all year round!!

After the first time trying this back in 2013, it immediately became my favorite &  I'll be faithfully buying this product as long as it is around!",1
"ugh, i got an awful burn with this stuff! I used it while I was pregnant, and i burnt so badlynot fun!",0
"The product itself is awesome! A lot of my hair stylist friends use it and recommend it.
The shipping of the product itself is not that great. It doesn't come with a cap, so what I opened the package the serium was all over the place. I recommend buying it from a salon.",1
"My 12 yr old daughter has been using this to wash her face every night for a little over a month.  While that is not long enough in my opinion to say how well it works long term, it has been long enough to see a significant reduction in the number of reddened, swollen pimples she has.  In fact, she had some that were quite bad, and they have almost completely disappeared with just a bit of redness beneath the surface remaining (keeping in mind that the skin takes a while to heal.)

Now my biggest concern is that she does have a number of blackheads that seem to still be hanging around, but I did notice that they are softer and seem to be slowly disappearing.  Keeping her from picking at them is the tough part, but she has seen where that can lead with large swollen red bumps, so she's been better about that lately.  We're hoping with continued use, that will continue to clear up slowly.  I'll update this review if we see more significant improvement.",1
"This is a very wimpy hot air brush. I have very fine, hair and it takes me a long time to dry it using this. However, I have not gotten my hair tangled up in the brush. Just wish the blow dryer was better. Not a good choice.",0
"I needed a new hair dryer and after reading other reviews on Amazon picked this one. It's reasonably light weight (important for my elbows), dries my hair in good time using the medium heat (the high heat gets really hot) and if what the rating says - there are ions put back on the hair. I'm not sure about that part, but my hair is a bit better. Great hairdryer for the money and I hope it will last longer than the cheaper ones I've bought in the past.",1
This product did not work for my split ends and dried my hair out more.  Not all together the products fault my hair was really damaged,0
"I like this product and it was a great buy.  I use it every day.
Very pleased with purchase.  Thanks",1
"Went back to DE shaving after 40 years.  Got tired of escalating prices for number of needless blades in cartridges.  Bought this based on recommendations.  It met or exceeded all expectations.  Easy to lather, produces a very close shave with right blades, and better value for money than canned products.",1
"Oribe Signature Shampoo is strips my hair each time I use it and leaves it so knotted, that I have difficulty getting a comb through my hair. I would NOT recommend this shampoo for curly hair, which tends to be dry hair. I normally use the INOA by Loreal shampoo and conditioner but thought I'd give this a try after reading some reviews. Big Mistake! I never over the counter shampoos (for probably the past 20 years) and would suggest those with dry hair or those who have chemically-treated hair to look elsewhere. I've yanked my hair out trying to get the comb through and my ends are now dry and split. So wanted to like this shampoo, but after only a few uses will have to either toss this or give to someone with an oily scalp, hair not treated by color or with more limp hair.",0
"Super super strong smell, and not a pleasant smell......The smell is way too strong to let me think about it's face cleansing gel. And, it's ok to be a cleansing but nothing about make up remover.",0
Love this product but it is SOOO expensive!,1
"The feel is alright, but I had a very hard time seeing my nails. The depth wasn't good either which meant I had to cut them 2-3 times. The product quality is okay...the black part is some sort of plastic/acrylic. It cut the nails fine, but I've used better ones.

Maybe I'll try it a couple more times and see if I can get used to it.",0
"I love anything Mario Badescu. That being said, if you are looking for a facial scrub this is not going to exfoliate your skin. It smells heavenly and cleans your face, but it is more of a cream cleanser that is great for a gentle wash or sensitive skin. I am going to say this again because it really does smell that good, the almond and honey scent is absolutely amazing and I use it in conjunction with other facial scrubs because it smells that good. It is a bit over priced based on its utility, so I probably won't purchase this again for myself (if you are looking for a great facial scrub I would suggest NU skin products, BFF facial scrub or Clinic Exfoliator), but my friend is obsessed with almond scented things and has sensitive skin so I will buy it for her.",1
"I was looking for a foaming face wash for oily skin and after much searching, I chose this because of the reviews.  This is just ""meh."" It didn't make me breakout but after a month of using once a day, with the Clarisonic Smart Profile, I noticed no change and I didn't feel ""clean.""  I'll use it every so often to use the rest of the bottle but I will not recommend nor purchase again.",0
"I NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT SO I DO NOT KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS, HOWEVER IT HAS A LOT OF CHEMICALS THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR HAIR REGROWTH AND SOME HAVE SHOWN TO INCREASE RISK OF CANCER. PLEASE READ IN INGREDIENTS BEFORE PURCHASE WHICH I FAIL TO DO.",0
"I have olive skin and my favorites are 4th and 5th (from left) colors. The first 3 are not shimmery, the last 3 are. I can't seem to get the first one to ever come off on my brushes, even when wet. The second color looks VERY peachy pink on me, I think it looks nice paired with a brown eyeliner. I find I cannot use any of these shadows, however, without having a wet brush or primer on my lids or else it all end up in a pile on my cheekbones. I am using a stila eyeshadow brush.",1
"While the perfume smells great, it is not worth the money. The perfume bottle comes half full, which is absurd for the expense.",0
"If you want your nail enamel to last longer when you do your manicure, then this is the product for you!!!  It's very thick and with one application your done!  I love it!",1
"Not a pleasant feeling, too sticky, won't buy again",0
Very good. Subtle signature.,1
Not worth the price,0
Not my favorite. The formula hurt my eyes. Im sticking with urban decay! The gel formula is drying and feels uncomfortable like you can feel it on,0
Didn't work on my hair at all,0
"I WILL CONTINUE TO TELL YOU GUYS THIS PRODUCT IS  VERY GOOD  AND DOES NOT WEIGHT DOWN YOU HAIR, A MUST TRY IT",1
"I've used Jane Iredale PurePressed Base in the Suntan shade for years but this refill seemed a lot lighter than what I'm used to using.  In addition and most unfortunately, it broke into pieces when I traveled with it in my luggage.... A $40 disappointment and mess!",0
"I used the Glycolix Acid Pads religiously every night for 2 weeks. My face started to look worse after only a few days and did not get better. i received no compliments on my skin either. Also, I started to peel, which is fine, I read all the other reviews so I expected that. However, I only peeled on my nose and chin which was very irrirating since those were the few areas that actually didn't have any blemishes. And my cheeks which looked like a war zone did not peel at all.

I really wanted this to work for me, but now i am back to the drawing board.",0
Best Nail Strengthener I've ever used......,1
Disappointed,0
"Love it.  My complaint...I place it on a washcloth on my bathroom counter.  As you can see it rubs off onto the washcloth, but it's not major.  I still love it.",1
"This ""drying lotion"" did not work well at all for me. I had a few pimples soon after receiving this product and was able to use it right away. It did not dry my pimples up at all after using it faithfully daily for one week. I went back to an older less expensive product that works so much better. For 17.00 I expected a much better product.",0
"I will update this review after a few more uses. I have had 3 sessions I believe, actually maybe it's been 4 with no noticeable result yet",0
"I've been using this moisturizer in the morning. First, it's a bit drying. And, haven't seen the brightening the product claims to have.",0
I use this every day. It smells wonderful- not at all like flowery perfume,1
very good,1
Love the CK One lotion but the order I got was for CK Be which is a totally different very perfumey scent. Now for the hastle returning it for what I actually ordered. Now nic to the Amazon team as they are fantastic with returns.,0
"Like many women, I have hormonal acne. This product is far BETTER than any prescription med I've received. I use this daily and coupled with a scrub. I will buy this product again.

SN: I am African-American with sensitive, oily skin. It is not harsh nor does it cause any irritation.",1
"Like the product, easier then going to mall to one of their stores.  Formula hasn't changed, and seems pretty consistent over the years.",1
Smooth!!,1
Nothing better out there. Especially for sensitive skin.,1
"I really wanted to like this product but it did nothing for me i used it consistently for a month every night after i washed my face before i went to bed & didn't see any results. It was a waste of money.
It also left my face pretty oily when i woke up.",0
"My first introduction to this particular product was when my hair stylist used it.  I asked, ""What is it and how can I get a bottle for myself?""  But before I asked him, I tried finding it on my own, by going to several beauty supply stores, only to find an imitation called argan oil.  Let me tell you, it is not the same.

If you are looking for a light weight product, that does not weigh your hair down, and smells good too, then this is it!  It is far better than the other oils and creams you are accustomed to, and you only need to apply a small amount.  I would also recommend buying the gold glimmer shine spray to top it off...My hairstylist uses this too.

It is a bit pricey compared to other oils, but investing into a product that is going to give you long lasting results such as shine, body and bounce, is well worth the money.  And to add, it is not your typical hair oil, which is why you will not find it in beauty supply stores.

Enjoy the product!",1
Made my hair super dry!,0
"Primarily, the color was too dark.",0
"Holds hair nicely, washes off easily!",1
"I bought one from TV. It does not seem to be what the pictures and tv commercial show. It made a huge mess of the counter and sink area. The fibers do attract to everything, but it's like rubbing carbon dust all over your hair. Patting my hair after I put it on per instructions made it worse. It's very black, so it does stand out against my hair. It does make hair look thicker BUT better not touch it, touch anything or come near anything.

Also, afterwards, I blew my nose and notice I had aspirated this stuff. Eeeek. Not good. I strongly suggest not breathing in when using it and taking shallow breaths thereafter.

Then I went into the shower. Wow. What a holy mess.

This made me laugh at my own gullibility and I guess desperation to be attractive and accepted based on how much carotene my head contains.",0
When I received the shampoo the cap had opened a little bit and there was shampoo all over the outside of the bottle,0
"After 1 month of using this iron, it stopped working completely. Complete waste of money! Believe al negative reviews! Fake product!",0
"I bought this because I read that it was great. The color is amazing, but even using an eye primer, it tends to run down to the lower lids. I used it once and will be returning it. I just couldn't use it. Too much maintenance throughout the day.",0
in my opinion they are a bit overpriced. This is why the 4 stars. This face buff works better than others I tried. It also has a nice scent and makes your face feel really refreshed.,1
"It only has 3 settings: Cool, medium, hot. I was not happy that I couldn't adjust the temperatures along with speed. I returned it because the medium is too low and the hot is too hot. I would have liked more control over the settings.",0
The Handi Bottle pack was just what I needed for an upcoming flight and the fact that it is TSA approved made it all the better.  I look forward to using it on other trips.,1
"I bought this shaving cream as a ""luxurious"" gift to myself. It's very expensive, and usually I go for a more basic shaving cream. But, I had had a rough time, and I figured I deserved a little treat.

I'm sorry to say, but I am very disappointed with this product. In my opinion, it is way overpriced, and does deliver on any of its promises. Let me summarise my complaint point-by-point:

1) It's very thin. When you put it on your hand, it just slips through your fingers, almost like water
2) It does NOT make facial hair soft (like a shaving cream is supposed to)
3) The result: lots of razor burns, and the tube of so-called shaving cream only lasts two weeks.

Men all over the world: I recommend you to look somewhere else for your shaving needs.",0
WAS OLD SMELLING,0
I have always purchased this at the salon but it's so expensive there. Been using this for years and wouldn't want to be without it. A must for thin hair that doesn't hold well.,1
This product caused my skin to breakout and I normally do not have acne at almost 40yrs. old. It could be from the dimethicone. Waste of money,0
"This product is sub-par to their other dry shampoo. This new spray is just ok :(I really like their other dry shampoo that was a powder, it worked so well and didn't make my hair look powdery and it smelled great.",0
This has an intense smell but totally does a great job!,1
Honestly I feel like it wasn't anything special I have used the whole bottle and my hair feels the same as if I bought drug store conditioner.,0
Made my hair more dry,0
"Good product, makes your hair soft and works great as a defrizzer (and for me, that's saying a lot - I have Hermione Granger hair.) The only complaint I have is the smell. It isn't a BAD smell...but it isn't a great smell either. Just smelling it tickled my nose and made me sneeze, and none of my hair products have ever done that before since I don't use hairsprays or anything like that. But, it worked so much better than the leave-in conditioners that I tried from the salon (Biolage products, for example). So for that, I will deal with the smell and give it 4 stars out of 5.",1
It has not met my expectations,0
the goods is very good .i like it and would buy next time,1
smells horrible and dries up your skin,0
Worked really well,1
"I don't usually write reviews unless I really appreciate the product or have issue with it. I looooove this hair straigthner, it is actually the best hair straightener I got so far. I have frizzy and curly hair but it takes 10 minutes to straight my hair and when I'm done it seriously looks like I just got out of from hair saloon. Worth every single penny. Arrived on time and it was the cheapest one I found online. Definitely recommend it!!
buy from this seller you will save around 20-40$.",1
"The hairdyer worked great at first.  It made my frizzy hair soft and manageable but the ionic part of the dryer stopped working after a couple months.
Now it just acts like a regular hairdryer, no longer making my hair soft and frizz free.",0
"Works great, only complaint is it makes my hair very dry",1
"Great product, great price.",1
"I didn't believe that it actually worked, my mother swore it did - so we tested it out on my leg. I still have 'HI' spelled out in missing leg hair from a year and a half ago. Too bad I left it at home when I was moving away. Here I am having to buy it again, since my mother reuses to send it to me.

It does hurt a little. Or a little more than a little. I have extremely dark hair and light skin. It's a little hard to figure out where you used it if you're trying a big spot at a time. Start small. It works well.",1
Makes my hair soft and manageable,1
"I've been using this lip stain for 5 years now and there's nothing like it. You can make it light or dark depending on how many times you apply it on your lips at one time. It is not glossy or waxy like lipstick or lip gloss. That's actually what I like about it and it stays on for a long time because of it. I do put burt's bees on after the stain dries for some moisture for my lips. One tube lasts me about 6 months of daily use.

UPDATE 2-25-13:
Where is Baby Boo?? It's my favorite color!",1
Love this fragrance; not sure packaging is the best.  Small amount of leakage in shipment and the label is not very well adhered.,1
"Before I started using this product, I was experiencing a lot of irritation on my eye lids from my eye shadow.  My eyes, and eye lids were burning from allergies to my eye shadow and mascara,.  But, this primer has helped me so much to relieve my eyes of this inflammation.  I put the primer on my complete eye lids, and under my lower lash line, then I let it dry.  I put an allergy eye drop in first, then I put on my eye pencil and shadow, and now there is no burning at all.  I also had a problem with mascaras irritating my eyes too, so I switched to Lancme mascara which helped a lot.  I also take an over the counter allergy pill. I had been using the allergy drop, and allergy pill before, but it was not enough for relief.  This product stopped all my eye lid burning, without me having to quit or change my eye pencil and shadow.",1
"One of my favorite shampoos for removing build up and getting rid of dullness. It's a tad pricey but a little goes a long way, as it's makes a ton of lather. My hair is shoulder length and ""normal"" with slightly dry ends from heat styling. This shampoo gives me a lot of shine and seems to be clarifying. My favorite part (which may turn some people off) is that this smells exactly like Christmas egg nog. It has this creamy bourbon & vanilla smell while you're using it, but it dissipates as soon as your hair is dry. My only complaint is it's one of the harder Phyto formulas to find and there isn't a coordinating conditioner.",1
"Maybe my expectations were too high but I'm also wondering if the product was past shelf life. Color is okay, product is way too thick. I've found the only way to apply is with really thin coats. The problem: it dries and clumps too thin and is hard to paint on without the brush being fully coated. Disappointed especially for the price",0
I've had rough and scaly elbows for a long time. I've used different moisturizers and lotions but none of them really helped. I bought this cream based on the reviews. After only a few days it took off all of the dead skin on my elbows. It did burn a little but it wasn't too bad. Now my elbows are soft and I use lotion to maintain the softness. Next I'm going to try it on my heels. But this is some pretty good and powerful stuff.,1
Gives great lift to my hair without stiffness or stickiness,1
"The label says ""Fragance FREE"" but it smells pretty AWFUL. This is not the original product. I had use this product before and the one I received is BULL",0
"I've purchased this product in the past from a local salon and love the product itself,  but when I received my bottle from this vendor, it looked partially used, so I sent it back.",0
"I have chemically relaxed hair and I did not like this for my hair. My hair is shoulder length and not fine but not thick either. This was too oily for my hair and weighed my hair down and made it look stiff. With African American hair I have never used a heat protectant or anything at all before straightening but that is also why my hair is severley heat damaged and breaking off not including the damage the relaxer alone does. With this it seems you have to be VERY careful I mean drop for drop careful. Maybe I never figured out exactly how much to use. Even a dime size amount was too much and after blow drying my hair was stiff and oily, not flowing and shiny. Just not for my hair type or texture. Still on the journey to find a heat protectant that is light enough for flowing hair but not oily and greasy so the search continues.........",0
"I don't often wear lipstick, but I haven't had a new one in so long, I thought I would like to try this one. It is one of the shades I like. butter LONDON Plush Rush Lipstick, Lucky from butter LONDON goes on smoothly and stays looking fresh. I wore it for a long day out at a picnic, and out for brunch with a friend. Both days it was hot, both days I was outdoors for hours. Both days I also used, as I typically do, I dabbed a couple of spots on my cheeks and smoothed it in to give my cheeks some color. I prefer that to powdered blush, because I have dry skin. That worked quite well, too. The color stayed on lips and cheeks and I am very pleased with this beauty product.",1
Great products,1
"I have been using this product for about 5 years now, and I haven't switched to another moisturizer, and I don't plan on doing so either.  This moisturizer is lightweight and perfect for underneath makeup or even for bedtime.",1
"Since this was a present for somebody, I don't know first hand how well it worked.  I  have only heard that she loves the color.",1
works well,1
good,1
"I just love this stuff!  Ok, so its kinda gross when you think about what it is you're putting on your face, but I'm the type of person that would rub dog poo on my face if it made me pretty lol....This stuff smells great, feels great and is awesome for my sensitive skin...I literally break out to just about anything and everything, but not this stuff....I'm in love!",1
"I love this Bronzer, it is not shimmery and dark. It is a very natural matte color and works great as a bronzer for contouring techniques or even alone as a blush.",1
white looking film when I put it on....I thought it would be clear...wasn't smooth and moisturizing....,0
"I bought this for my niece's xmas gift. We received it on time, but the bottle was completely leaking. half of the perfume was gone.",0
waiting to see,1
"I had heard about this polish Today show.  They claimed it had amazing last.  First of all I guess I will no longer pick nail polish colors from a screen.  I got the Goss which looked like a nice, light, almost skin colored pink but it is actually almost metallic.  I put on tow coats and it was wearing off the tips of my nails within 48 hours.  I don't spend a lot of time in the water and I wear rubber gloves when rinsing the dishes.",0
"I love all Rusk products.  The smell is great, not too strong.  The hold is good.  Does not leave hair sticky or hard, nor white flakes!",1
Good as advertised,1
great for wifes hair,1
"Does not ""help"" my lips in any way.",0
Thank you!,1
I like this Hair Spray but I think I paid a lot of money for this Tiny bottle. but it works on my very dry hair. specially for those hair strands who always sits in upright position and I was fed up applying gel etc just to make them sit. This Little guy has a quality that made my hair soft and managable after using iron. nice and recommended.,1
Wonderful hand cream - not greasy - perfect moisturizer!,1
Love this product !!,1
Love it! Everyone should own this. It came right on time and it's an OPI and a great color. Thanks!,1
"This new formula is good -also this is a new cream from proraso -I like the fragrance it reminds me of some kind of nice smelling soap. The cream it's self is good quality, not the best but good,considering price I say get it.",1
"Great purchase! I have a lot of hair, long and thick so finding a good hair dryer is difficult to find. BabylissPRO is simply great. It dries fast and it makes styling my hair easy.",1
This item cannot be shipped and is stuck with my freight forwarder. It should be mentioned in the product page that there is a high alcohol content. I am wondering why should there be a high alcohol content in the product and can that be good for my scalp health.,0
I have used a lot of hair products as I experimenti with different haircuts. This is by far my favorite hair product and after a little experimenting with it I found out how to make it work wonders,1
"It was good was expecting more, having heard so much about it!
The scent is a bit strong for me.",0
"I liked the product; but when you finish the blow dry, yoye scalp gets a White layer that seems dandruff, it doesnt relaxes your hair as much as I expected, but it was ok",1
After just a couple of uses the brush started coming apart.  I emailed customer service and apparently they don't honor any kind of warranty or stand behind their products.,0
"Toppik as a hair fiber/thickening product is fantastic and it works as advertised, but this hair perfecting tool kit is awful. The hairline optimizer makes the Toppik fiber look like you were using a fine tooth comb as a guide so it is virtually useless. The spray applicator works at a minimal level--I buy the 2 ounce bottles and the applicator will only fit the 1 ounce size and smaller. I transferred the fibers into the correct size container to test the applicator and ends up blowing fiber all over. You really have to pump this thing to get it working and more often than not it just leaves concentrated circles of fibers. Forget the applicator and shake it on your head. Also since regular hairspray is a thing, there is nothing worth getting in this kit. I would return this product given the chance.",0
I have bags under my eyes; this did nothing for me. Preperation H works much better.,0
"As I get older, I have realized that primer is an absolute necessity. It fills in fine wrinkles and provides a matte canvas for foundation.

I have used DHC Velvet Skin Coat and more recently Clarins Flash Beauty Balm.  I swear by my Beauty Balm but it retails for $45. At $33, this is a less expensive alternative. It does pretty good. It is on par the DHC primer for both price and usability. The Japonesque's size is big for the price.",1
"So I first heard about this product from a coworker who let me borrow some lotion and I really liked how it smelled. I was going to buy it on the actual Crabtree & Evelyn website but I figured I'd see if I could get it for cheaper. Amazon came through in the clutch because buying it on here is cheaper than the website. The lotion arrived pretty quickly in the mail, so I didn't have to wait around to smell good. The bottle comes in the box that is shown and then it has a little cap so it doesn't accidentally spill. The lotion itself is great. I personally love natural smells and this hits the jackpot. It's Citron, Honey & Coriander so its a very light and fresh smell. It's light (it doesn't feel oily or heavy) but it doesn't go away to quickly so that's nice. I honestly can't describe how much I love the smell of this lotion. Give it a try, it's a great product at a great price.",1
Smells great!  Can't complain about the quality of the cream too :),1
"I found it to be too greasy.  I would not buy again.  The SPF was only 33.  I am used to a SPF 50.

My lashes looked better with nothing on them! They looked sparse and skinny. I love the concept though.,0
"No, it did not, I don't see no improvement in,my face.",0
Not sure.,0
This was not the product pictured,0
A super light tonic that refreshes my dry skin during the day!  I love it!,1
"I like color, but the texture is gritty and has a strange and bad lemon taste.",0
Made me break out worse than before I started using this product it did clear up for a while but my acne still proceeded and it did not make me look like a model like the product claimed for people wanting to use skin care that models use did not work for me I would not suggest buying if you have bad acne!!!,0
"For my skin, the claims for this eye cream are not exaggerated.  It gets rid of dark circles from eye strain, puffiness from allergies, plumps fine lines, and helps firm the fold that is my eyelid.  I really needed something for the skin above my eyes, which is trying to get lower all the time, but most eye creams are not approved for use on the eyelids or above the eyes.  This cream is ophthalmologist tested, as well as dermatologist tested, so I have the assurance that it won't damage my eyes.  It makes the skin around my eyes look great, and it never creeps onto my eye balls, like so many other eye creams do. I use this morning and night, and it helps my eyes look fresh and healthy.",1
"I'm super sensitive to scents so when I find one that I can wear, it makes me happy.  I happen to love this one!",1
"Very moisturizing with no oily residue. Wish it was slightly more moisturizing for my skin condition, but for normal dry skin would work perfectly.",1
"I love most of L'occitane product and use them for years: night cream, toner, deodorant, hand lotion, shower gel...This shampoo helps me preventing hair loss in comparison with other shampoo I tried, such as Velvet. I even don't need to use a conditioner after using this shampoo, my hair is still smooth and look good.",1
"If you lose the tiny piece of paper inside the cap, this bottle will leak everywhere. The remover itself works very well.",0
"This product is really moisturizing - doesn't dry out your lips like some lip balms and even chap sticks tend to do sometimes. It gives such a beautiful pop of colour on my lips, and I can put more on if I want it darker, and less if I want just a touch of colour but a lot of moisture. Now that they've stopped selling it at Sephora, I'll definitely keep ordering it on Amazon. It lasts forever as well!!",1
"This is the best face cleanser I have ever used. The texture is creamy and smooth with white color and mild scent. I used it to clean my face with powdery foundation and it removed everything, left my face skin soft and moisturizer. I am amazed. Imagining that cleaning face is a luxury experience, that is how I feel. I don't need moisturizer anymore because this cleanser has essential oils Which moisturize and ensure that the skin is not damaged as you cleanse. The only concern is it is quite pricey, but it worth it.",1
"I like this safety razor, Although it does not shave as close as a vanderhagen. I shave my head and my face with this and I have not cut my self with it yet.",1
Give it some time to heat up and you won't be disappointed!!,1
Very waxy. Doesn't stay for more than 6 hours.,0
I don't understand why someone would not love this product! I have very bad acne and needed something to help rejuvenate skin but wasn't causing my skin to be Addicted to a medicine (I formerly used Pro****v). I admit the first time I used this product I went over one area too many times causing some scabbing. But the scabbing went away in less than a week. It was my fault for not watching the DVD. Now I am a professional and my skin really looks and feels different. I have absolutely no reason to endorse a produce that does not work. I could immediately tell the texture of my skin had become smoother. Also my pores are smaller and I don't get breakouts anymore. I am using this in combination with tea tree oil to control my acne. It is a God-Send.,1
Did not work for me. Have been using this for 2 months and no change in the facial hair. I really wanted this to work but nothing.,0
made me breakout,0
"I've used this shampoo for years and love it.  I received it quickly and in good shape.  No problems, and I will order again.",1
"This was a fairly disappointing polish.  When it arrived and I saw what appeared to be a dark jelly with glitter chunks floating in it, I was excited because it looked like it would be great.  However, when applied, this is just a clear coat with a few sparse flecks of glitter in it.  I applied it to all 10 nails, and only 3 of them had a speck of glitter on them.  Although polishes like this are meant to be applied in multiple coats so that they can build, this one is really hardly worth applying unless you want to put on so many coats that your nails actually become thick.  The first few swipes out of the bottle were just clear, and this was after shaking multiple times.  There are lots of better glitter polishes out there.  Try Deborah Lippmann or Zoya instead. They will give you more bang for your buck.",0
"I researched tons of spf for the face and hate the stuff that goes on white, and requires that you rub and rub and rub till it blends.  Forget it if you have facial hair.
this stuff seems to work pretty well and has helped my complection on the left side of my face.  I'm in sales and drive around all day everyday in Southern Cal.  SPF 15 wasn't doing the trick.  so far this stuff works well.  It's been about a year and ready to order more.",1
It's pricey but it keeps my lips well moisturized.  I wear it overnight nad haven't had chapped lips since I started using it.,1
Finally a product that dries the nail polish fast so you do not have to sit and wait for 25 minutes for the polish to dry. Love this product!!,1
I believe this must have been a counterfit product. It smelled like motor oil and burned my skin. I ended up throwing it away.,0
High quality mascara. Worth every penny,1
"The quality is impressive.  It would make a great gift for someone who travels.  All three items are of a high-quality metal.  The file is a five star product.  The hair trimmer is manual, not battery powered.  It's a little awkward to use but they couldn't have designed it better.  The nail clippers are probably three and a half stars.  You need lots of light to use them.  But they are very sharp.  The container they come in looks sharp.  I would definitely give this as a gift but I feel it is a little expensive.  Henckel knives are well known for their quality and the set does not lack their typical quality.  I'd give it a five star rating if it was price around $75.  Obviously that is very subjective but it's the way I feel.",1
"Have not used yet.  Waiting for previous bottle to be empty.  Good product and leaves less ""yellow"" around the neck of my tops.",1
Love it!,1
"Out of all my hot tools products this is probably my least favorite, but I still use it a lot! If you are going for a subtle wave this is a great curling iron.",1
"I feel like this product dries out my scalp.

It makes my hair nice and clean and soft but shortly after I feel like my scalp is itchy. This does not happen with any other product",0
"This stuff saved my hair. My hair felt like straw after bleaching it once (my hair is naturally a very light brown) so I used this mask for 10 minutes. It made my hair feel so healthy and look so good, that I just ordered the full size.",1
Lipstick was broken when I opened it :( I tried to use it anyway but it didn't really work since it was so loose. I am very disappointed especially after how much I spent.,0
Didn't realize what a tiny amount I was getting.  Next time I have to order the giant size!,0
"I got the one in Sophia and it's a lovely coral color, better than I had expected it would be.  However, the packaging is the problem.  The lipstick just sticked to the lid and I was really upset and shocked.  I thought i didn't turn it back in deep trouble enough but it's not.  I don't know is that just me or this happened to others as well, just I am really upset that I've lost already 1/3 of the lipstick when I haven't even started using it... :(",0
I like the quality of these shadows.  Never having used The Balm products before I like that in this palette I have gotten the opportunity to try many of their top/popular products.  Do not love the lip colors very much.,1
One of the best,1
"I LIKED IT, HOWEVER IT BURNS YOUR EYES SOMETIMES IF YOU APPLIED ON THE WRONG PLACE LOL",1
"Perfect, love this!",1
It is not the right color for my dark skin. They could have more options for who is darker.,0
Too raggedy ann red,0
"Terrible, doesnt work
Bought the medium and used it at night, saw no results, then i started using twice a day and still no results
Only thing that turned color a little was my cuticles and dead skin around my nails
Cant even return, what a waste of $$
Maybe its my skin type or something, im very fair skinned, so i was even scared to get too dark, but again, no results!!!",0
"I'm a BIG Stila fan because they do not test on animals and have high quality products.

This particular product just doesn't agree with me. While it does stay on all day...and THEN some, it feels very heavy and sticky. My eyes did not have a reaction to it or anything (they are allergy prone and sensitive), but the feel of it really bothered me. Also, you will have to use makeup remover to get this mascara off completely. Simply washing will not do. It took me about 3 days to get it all off with regular face wash.

As for the claim that your lashes will feel soft after wearing this mascara...mmmm, nope.

Sorry Stila. 'Love most of your products, just not this one.",0
"The product was similar to a lot of other ""mousse"" products i have bought in the past that cost much less.  It did not really lift my very fine, straight hair.  Plus it dried out my hair.",0
"I was surprised to discover that it didn't last all day, and it's nearly impossible for the remnants to be scrubbed off your eyelids when it's time to remove it. I guess I expected a really great product, considering it's 3 times more expensive than my normal eyeliner. Has anyone tried to return this product? I've only used it about 5 times, and I don't think I can continue...",0
It's creamy and my eye area feels hydrated. Wish it was a line eraser! lol I would recommend it.. I'm super sensitive as well. Have had no issues with anything from Pevonia,1
"it smells great! i love the rose smell from Jurlique, it just a little dry when you apply it to lips.",1
"This might work better for shorter hair.
My hair is very long (to the middle of my back) and even when leaving the curlers in for an hour did not help the curl stay in my hair.  The end of my hair did have a little bit of a curl, but it would not stay without a terrible amount of hair spray.",0
"Works great. Be stingy to avoid a ""cakey"" look though.",1
Love this product,1
"Ok, so I had these bumps on my forehead that would just NOT go away. Acne? Who knows. I'm in my 30s. So it just didn't seem fair! I've tried like every product at the drug store. This Tammy Fender Epi-Peel was amazing. After one use (this past Sunday, today is Thursday)) the bumps have cleared up by at least 50% if not more! I love this product. It smells delicious and I can't wait to use it again this weekend! LOVE it!",1
Very moisturizing I like this product and will probably order again,1
"This stuff will really hold but it's ""dry.""

I have about 5"" of hair in the front and top and alternate between Paul Mitchell's Tea Tree shaping cream and Aveda's grooming clay, both of which I like for their matte, medium-strong hold and the work-ability. I gave this a try and it sure is matte and strong, but it's also strong enough where my fingers can no longer comb through my hair after the product's mixed in.

I'm keeping it for when I travel to some place more humid, where a stronger hold is required to combat the humidity droop, but I'll stick to my other hair products for the day-to-day.",1
"The fact is, this stuff works under certain circumstances. Those circumstances are that you still have some hair. At least 1/3 of what was up there before the universe decided to take a huge dump on your existence. Don't think this stuff will make you look like you did when you were 18 years old. My expectations were that I'll still look like I'm thinning but that I still had enough to pull off a decent hair style. It's black or white. You either look like you have no business styling your head or you do. This stuff will put you into the latter category. Use it sparingly to avoid detection. People aren't going to see you and immediately inspect your head. Especially if they, themselves, don't deal with thinning hear. It just isn't something they think about regularly like you. It'll keep your head under the radar and not a topic of view. It should be used in conjunction with other modes. Especially something that will bring a halt to your loss.",1
This has been my scent for years...it's lovely!,1
The easel on the first one broke after 8 months.  Japonesque sent a replacement but it only lasted 2 months.  This is an obvious design flaw that the company won't fix.  It's too bad because this is a great eyelash curler; it just doesn't last.  Maybe they should offer lifetime curler replacements instead of lifetime pad replacements because it will never last long enough to replace the pad.,0
Doesn't last long and the smell after half a day turns more foul due to mix of sweat and citrus deodorant odor.,0
Love,1
Was delivered in my mailbox and leaked all over EVERYTHING! Not only did ruined the mail in the box with it but leaked all over my clothes.  There's no seal on the bottle and the cap was loose.,0
Does NOT removed waterproof mascara.  Going to return the product.,0
"Try all organic Katira - the ingredients are all food quality - no glycerin, silicone based compounds that dry and damage your hair, and all organic.
[...]",0
Makes my nails stronger but they turn yellow and it looks very ugly even after I remove the polish.,0
Only bought because some said it's great,0
Was recommended on a cruise ship but too pricey. Bought it on Amazon when I returned home and I love it for those painful tight muscles and knots in my upper nack. I would not have believed it.,1
Didn't work on my skin. It cause more acne,0
It works exactly as advertised. It's the best cuticle remover I've found for use at home.,1
Good Product,1
"Does absolutely nothing, huge waste of money. Took mine back for a refund.",0
"Tried to return at the machine near my home and it wouldn't work
 Very annoying to try and return setting
 I need a. Return form ????",0
Burns hair easy,0
Ive been trying to like this product but it doesn't seem to be doing anything for my skin. I use it twice a week and have been for three months. I doesn't seem to make a difference in fact I keep getting little pimples when I do use it! So I feel I have given it a fair chance. It probably works great for others but not for me. I am 36 years old with fair skin. I just had a baby so maybe my skin is just hormonally messed up anyway!,0
This foundation is full coverage.  It goes on fairly easy and is buildable.  It does good job of making my skin tone look even and covering some light sunspots and redness from blemishes.  This is heavier than I'm use to and I could feel it on my face. My skin is somewhat dry and I feel by the ended of the day it settled into creases and fine lines so I will definitely moisturize well before I apply this next time. If your skin is dry and it settles into the creases and fine lines it can age you and I don't want that. Overall it did a good job covering and evening out my skin so I am pleased with that but do to it being so heavy this won't be my everyday foundation but more of something I wear on special occasions.  It mostly stayed on when I rinsed it with water and removed well when I used my face cleanser.,1
"This product is terrible.  I wouldn't pay more than $ 0.50.  It irritated my skin, and didn't even smell good.  Do they think that by giving it a French name people will pay an exhorbitant price for an inferior product ?",0
I like that this sunscreen is slightly tinted.  It goes on smoothly and blends well.  My only wish is that the SPF were 30 or higher instead of only 20.,1
"The best thing about this product is its light, barely there scent. Too many hair products have a heavy, overwhelming odor which can clash with a fragrance you are wearing or just give you a headache. This pomade is a medium weight, holds hair without weighing it down too much and is easily reactivated with a little water. I use a little water when I apply it initially so that I get good coverage without too much product. I wish that the product was free of parabens but at least the pomade is mostly on the hair and not on the skin.",1
"Wasn't what I expected. If you put it directly on your hair... It dumps into one spot causing clumps, and if you try to sprinkle it around... Too much product. Most recommended way is to sprinkle into your hand and emulsify it with both hands, and then applying. Defeats the whole purpose, might as well get a regular cream or paste. I was excited but was let down. Great idea, practical it is not.",0
I found that the angle of the blade created when its tightened down in the head of the razor isn't 'steep' enough to cut properly. I have an Edwin Jagger which preforms much better.,0
It's fine. I don't use anymore.,1
Perfect nude color.  Goes on smoothly.  Dries pretty quickly.  Protects and lasts well.,1
This product usually lasts me about 4 months but this time (first time I buy at Amazon) lasted me almost a month.... so it wasn't completely full.  Bad item. I won't buy it here anymore but I did it because of the time.. BAD IDEA ,0
Cap doesn't screw shut - just spins around. The product is pretty dry and sticky. Like dried-up white toothpaste. I've stopped using it and there's probably 90% left in the jar. Would not purchase again.,0
This is literally the only thing that I have ever used and seen an actual change in my skin. I think that speaks for its self!,1
"Light weight, doesn't leave oily residue. Fast shipping",1
"I've ordered this Gloss before in ""Bloom"" color & really liked consistency, feel & it really does plump up lips. It's a bit darker & brighter than I normally wear but liked it anyway & can tone down putting a lighter one over.  I ordered again to try lighter colors offered.  They came in a ""frosted tone"" which was not mentioned in description....so they are just ok as far a color & look I like. Would not have ordered them if I'd known they were frosted because, as a mature woman, frosted is not my best look but sometimes mix them with the ""unfrosted"" to tone down the glitter. They were colors, ""Heaven"" & ""dreamy""....Heaven color was very frosted & my least favorite. I'm a fair skinned blonde in my 50's.
I definitely prefer the ""unfrosted"" versions & request Amazon to specify ""frosted"" on those colors that are.
Otherwise really like this product & the plump look it gives my lips. Great value for the money compared to other brands I've tried that claim to plump lips.",1
"Item returned, was not pleased with product and service",0
Didn't notice any results and was sticky.,0
"I really like this shower gel. The smell is fragrant and woodsy, but gives a nice subtle linger long after. Many have mentioned the lack of lather while using. I've found the best way to apply the gel is with a shower loofah towel. You just need a little amount and it will lather like fireworks on the 4th of July. It will save you lots of the soap as a little goes a long way when used properly.",1
smells great,1
"This Dermablend Intense Powder Camo Medium to Full Coverage was darker than expected. It applied really well, blended in quickly and nicely. It performed well in the warm weather and never looked like caked on makeup.  Also, it didn't need reapplication. It covers flaws well and though this is more than I would typically pay, the performance is worth it.",1
Didn't work,0
Excelent,1
Good product. Makes your hair soft and shiny. It also smells good.,1
"Works for me, washes off no problem and stays in place.",1
Disappointed! I believe it is watered down. Doesnt hold like It has for me before and I will not buy again.,0
Good,1
"Great shaving cream - beats the pants off of the normal consumer products hands-down.

I find it to be a little pricey, but definitely worth a try.  It's gonna last you a while anyway.",1
"This exfoliating product does the job!  I use it nightly, with good results.  It does take getting used to.  I have very sensitive skin, so occasionally I go off it if my skin gets irritated.  In the summer, I am careful to wear sunscreen, because the Glytone makes my skin more susceptible to sunburn.",1
"This stuff is a watery mess.  I cannot believe that I was too lazy to send it back.  If you are interested in good self tanner, Vite Libra, also sold on Amazon.",0
"Lasts, it doesn't run when I cry in movies.  It does flake off sometimes, especially if I rub my eyes.",1
Not buy again.,0
"This is a very expensive skin therapy serum. The aim here is to reduce the visible signs of aging in facial skin. It's oil that you rub into your face twice a day. Only 2 or 3 drops are needed each time, but keep in mind - the bottle only contains half an ounce of oil. Age spots and blemishes are supposed to be reduced, as is the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles. The ingredients list sunflower seed oil, sesame oil, safflower oil, shea oil, strawberry seed oil, and a bunch of others (check the images in the product description for the full list). Maybe one month of usage just isn't enough to see noticeable results. I believe the intentions of the company are good, but this price ($71 per bottle, in other words $142 per ounce!) just isn't practical, especially when there isn't any really noteworthy effect. My wife suggested this product has a placebo effect, if anything. It's probably easier to exercise a little wishful thinking with this product when basing an opinion strictly off a sample. But I think I'd be even more negative and basically feel outright duped if I had shelled out for this.",0
Excellent!,1
Great shine and hold,1
Packaging was the same as previous product I used(1 per month) and loved it. Product ingredients were very different additionally  scent was (for me)offensive. Celadon Spa was not helpful: emailed suggesting I call Amazon with issue. Stay away from this Lotion because the product ingredient were changed yet not indicated and therefore not consistent product. I just cut my losses and discarded both bottles.,0
"Lovely moisturizer.
It's a thick cream but melts into your skin as it warms to your skin.
I have oily skin but due to use of retinoids, it can be dry and patchy.
I use this mostly at night.
During the day it's a little too much because I need to apply a separate SPF and with both my face gets too oily.
I love the balm like texture.
I also love the citrus/orange blossom fragrance .
However if you are sensitive be waned that the fragrance is VERY strong.
I find the scent soothing and refreshing to use at night, almost like aromatherapy.
I look forward to applying it.",1
Not impressed.  Too little product for the price.  Will not buy again. No miracle here!,0
Works well!,1
"My skin type is normal to dry. I don't have a lot of acne but I got this product to reduce pimples that form around my T zone and Forehead. In the first 2 weeks of using this, I had normal results (what the product said it was supposed to do) and then after 3-5 weeks, the product stopped working and just sat on top of my skin. I kept this in a dry and cool place, so I know it wasn't where I kept that was effecting it.",0
I love the actual balm but the scent makes me nauseous.  The purchase process was great... but I just can't use it.,0
"I learned about this product last year on a cruise and have been using it ever since -- it detangles, leaves you with a nice shine, is easy to use, has a pleasant scent. It may seem a little pricey, but I'm still working on the first can I bought last year, so that's something to bear in mind.",1
Shorted out and burnt out in 4 months. Could have started a fire.,0
Color was good.  Not too orangey.  Got many compliments on this one.  GReat color for spring or summer . cross between orange and peach.,1
This is the first review Ive ever left. This is the best razor in the world. I am amazed! Third Ive owned and by far the best.,1
"This is the 2nd time I have ordered this product. The first time I ordered it was after I re received a sample of it in my monthly birchbox subscription. I ordered a full size immediately and was very happy with it.
I am on my second order/bottle and I notice a HUGE difference in the smell of the product. I also do not feel like it is working as well as my prior order. I noticed immediately that the packaging changed slightly as well (the top of the bottle now has a white center surrounded by the chrome) I am starting to think this is a knock off product and not the real deal.",0
"I terribly miss the old Poetic Waxing kit that came in a metal mug. Yes, it took longer to warm on the stove. Yes, I needed a dedicated saucepan that I used only to warm my wax, since wax got on the saucepan and was hard/impossible to clean. HOWEVER, I feel the microwave kit takes extra time too, and takes more attention/effort in the warming period, and results in waste of wax, and, as others have mentioned is smaller so is even MORE expensive per use than the original, which is sort of amazing given how much these have always cost.

In the microwave cup, the wax melts inconsistently and so I need to microwave, try to stir half-melted-half-hard wax, again microwave, again try to stir half-melted-half-hard wax, repeat six or seven times total. Also, I DISLIKE microwaving plastic. Yes, all sorts of industries tell us that microwaving plastic is safe. Girl, please.

But my main beef with the microwave kit is that in the actual process of waxing, as I dip the applicator into the wax and the scrape the excess off before applying it to my hairy person, most of the wax transfers to the inside walls of the microwave cup and hardens there. So that the next time I get out the wax kit, I have somehow scrape or chip the wax off the sides and into the bottom. I find that I can't get it all off, and it doesn't melt down, and so that's wax that gets wasted. And yes, as other comments have mentioned, the whole kit seems smaller and even MORE expensive. Every time I've used the microwave version of the kit, I felt insulted. It's poor design, and for the high price, I expect better.

One thing that remains excellent about the kit: the wax itself. It takes hair off. I've tried the inexpensive Parissa kit, and the wax in that kit is very ineffective compared to the Bliss wax.

(On a related note, there's a vendor here on Amazon who sells dead stock of the original waxing kit. I don't recommend that you buy one of those. They are six years old and for some reason, the wax doesn't perform like the Poetic wax we love. Perhaps this is due to the age of the kits, or perhaps the kits are defective, which is how the seller got a hold of the kits in the first place.)

Here's the silver lining! By brutally discontinuing my favorite waxing kit that I faithfully bought for years, Bliss has ultimately done me a favor. I'm now setting out to recreate the Original Poetic Waxing Kit experience on my own. I'm going to buy a wide, deep, and inexpensive enamel cup. I already have a set of 100 Gigi wooden applicators (way cheap here on Amazon, and in a wider range of useful sizes than is provided in the Bliss kit). And I WILL find a nice blue wax that performs as well as the Poetic Waxing wax. I'm going to try Starpil blue wax cubes (also available here on Amazon). If I can get it to work well, I will save so much money.

Hmph. So there.",0
Got here in three days... Excellent product,1
works to think my expensive makeup i forgot to put a lid on.,1
Great lotion for destressed hands due to weather and/or other damaging activities such as gardening.  My sister loves this.,1
"In the past, I have used Juice Beauty's moisturizer and was so pleased with it I thought ordering this acne set for my teenager would be a no-brainer. Boy, was I wrong!

 First, I must address the odor issue. The face wash and acne clearing serum smelled absolutely rancid.  When we first opened the acne clearing serum tube, the content came squirting and losing out. The serum was very liquidy, like water with smelly brown grains.  It looked like  puddle water and smelled like pond scum.  I immediately checked the date on the box, but we weren't near expiration.  I don't think the serum should have had the consistency our tube had.

 My son decided to try it despite it being malodorous and having an odd consistency. Unfortunately, after two weeks of using it his skin is dry it out and his acne looks no better. He decided to stop using it and pitch in the garbage. I can't blame him.

Despite it being malodorous and having an odd consistency. Unfortunately, after two weeks of using it his skin is dry it out and his acne looks no better. He decided to stop using it and pitch in the garbage. I can't blame him.

 I would not  recommend the acne kit.  Frankly, buying good old Noxzema, Ckearisil, or Neutrogena is the better way to go",0
Seems to keep my foreo clean. I use it about once a week to clean it.,1
"Love this product. I got the shade porcelain and it's a perfect match when I do not have any tanner on. I'm shade 1N1 in Este Lauder Double Wear for reference.
Doesn't make my makeup look cakey. It does provide a light amount of coverage. I have too much hyper pigmentation to wear it alone, but if I have a light coverage BB cream on, this can take it up to medium coverage.
This product is NOT TRANSFER RESISTANT. That's not a deal breaker for me, but if it is for you, keep that in mind.",1

"I was skeptical to purchase this based on the reviews warning how intense the acidity levels are in this product. I have sensitive skin and I am currently using another brand's lotion which only has 10% glycolic acid which definitely did sting when I first began using it. This product was like applying extra thick ordinary lotion. I put this lotion on my legs, upper arms and even my face straight after a shower and didn't feel any tingling at all. I even shaved my legs the night prior and used a sugar scrub to exfoliate. I am extremely disappointed especially since majority of the reviews are great and it is a bit pricy. I think I will send this back for a refund and stick with my original brand which goes up to 15%.",0
"I don't know what the hype is all about. This gloss stinks. Too sheer, no color at all, no staying power and sticky. Not what I'm looking for in a lip gloss. Waste of money.",0
$20 clear nail polish!?,0
A great blow dryer!! Cut my time down atleast half and my hair looks alot smoother as well. Was heavier then my old blow dryer so I was upset at first then I used it. A little heavier was worth how awesome it is.,1
"From the description, I thought I'd like this, but I don't.  I've been using American Crew body wash for years and haven't found one I like more.  I thought I'd try this because of favorable reviews.  Smells too ""woody"" to me instead of refreshing.  Of course fragrance is subjective.",0
Watch when buying color is actually grey,0
You can barely tell it's there. Very light and clean.,1
This product either,0
It is smaller than I expected and it doesn't dry nicely. .not worth the price plus shipping. .,0
caboki is waaaaaay better,0
Excellent price vs retail.,1
"This is my favorite shampoo of all time. I have very fine hair that I used to have to wash daily, because it would get oily very quickly. This is the first shampoo I have every come across where I can wash my hair, style it, and it last 2 days before I need to shampoo again! It's saved my hair, and my sanity!",1
It's NOT waterproof! Very frustrating!,0
This curling iron doesn't meet my needs and doesn't work the way it was described. When I went to return it I was told I couldn't! There was nothing that indicated that this item couldn't be returned when I ordered it. Buyer beware!!!!,0
This feels so wonderful on my skin and makes flawless makeup application easy.  I think my fine lines are disappearing since I began using this product.,1
I can tell these have been watered down because the texture is not the same as I have purchased in a salon.,0
"It smelled like rotten apricots, left white residue in my hair and cost a small fortune. Where's the benefit? Dove's dry shampoo is much cheaper, smells better and doesn't take two weeks to get here.",0
"Two things I dislike, leaves a waxy residue feeling on your skin and its no match for waterproof mascara. I look like Courtney Love after washing my face with this. Seems to just smear it around...I have to scrub the s*** out of my face to get the black smears off. So I have to wash my face after washing my face. Redundant.

Two things I DO like (but not enough to buy again) it has a nice lemon smell and it doesn't make my face feel tight or dry after using.",0
"Heats up very fast to help me get my hair curled fast.

"I like this product; it's moisturizing and color adjust to my lip color.  It is not long lasting but
I can live with that",1
"The product I received is definitely not the real Paul Mitchell ""The Detangler."" It has a terrible odor and does not work like the authentic item.",0
srsly? u sent me a pre-opened one. For shaving!! I am so angry!!,0
"Perfect color for a tan skin kinda girl, and the texture is great too!",1
I have very thin/fine hair. The product I normally use has been discontinued so I am trying to find s replacement. Heard good things about Nioxin from my hair dresser so I tried it. Sadly it didn't work for me and I cant rerturn it. Disappointed but most products don't work for me so it may not be the product but my hair type.,0
You don't need this. It does nothing. Its a glorified alcohol pad.,0
"I've ordered this before through Amazon and it proved to be the real perfume. This time however, either this is a fake or it somehow soured. It is not the correct scent. Not pleased.",0
"It's okay, not really worth the price point. It's not actually a serum, it smells and looks like sunscreen. It doesn't make my skin look any younger and goes on like a drug store moisturizer, seems to clog pores a little too. I have not gotten sun burn while I've worn this product though.",0
"They're cruelty free which is a big plus in my book - although ingredient details for ""fragrance"" are very narrow and the United States allows a lot of animal products to be disguised under the terms fragrance/parfum, the company states their products have been developed without animal testing.
I have insanely sensitive skin and this doesn't cause any problems for me. It's not 100% sulfate free but it's not the typical sodium laureth sulfate you find in most soaps, which is a big trigger for itchy skin. I just ordered the Lavender soap because that's one of my favorite scents. The price/size ratio is also reasonable.",1
"I like very close trimmed nails and this set is amazing.
The clippers are compact and cut very well. They are the best pair I've ever used. It takes a little getting used to because of the slim profile, but after a use or two they were my favorite.
The file has medium and coarse sides that do a great job. I'm not going to have to steal my wife's files ever again.
Nose hair trimmer... The machining is very sleek and it has that German look of precision. The problem is that you need to be very, very, careful when twisting the barrel. One false move and you'll be crying like a baby. It'll grab hold of a nose hair quicker than you can say, ach to lieber. It works pretty well as long as you are careful about not twisting when moving. ouch.

Update: I really liked the NH_Trimmer in all aspects except the unexpected occasional pain of a NH yanking.
The problem is that the rotor and the anvil. The tolerance is indeed German, with about 1/100"" (checked with mic).
Why not make it even closer, perhaps negative?
1. Take an old 2x4, drill a 5/8"" hole so the rotor fits nicely in there.
2. Unscrew chuck from anvil, slide out both pieces, leaving the rotor and the base that it is pressed into.
3. 16p nail. Put rotor in 2x4 hole (make sure there's at least 1/2"" on the other side so you don't drive rotor into work surface). Tap rotor out of mount.
4. Find an old Philips + screwdriver you don't mind scarring. It fits half inside rotor. Give a few love taps, checking with anvil until it feels quite snug.
5. Honing stone, drill. Put rotor in drill and polish with honing tool. Again, check with anvil.
6. Reassemble mount, sleeve, and rotor, by pressing together with a vice. !Use a piece of 1/2"" wood to prevent rotor from getting scratched up. Check a couple times during pressing that it's going in straight (it will straighten out itself, but you don't want and bending of rotor in the realigning). Also, don't press too tightly or the rotor will be pushed into the chuck and nothing will move.
7. Slide the anvil on and screw into the chuck. Put the cleaning tool back on the bottom. Just a touch of mineral oil, and spin several times. Wipe off excess oil.

The tool should still spin freely, but without any wiggle.
Worked for me, and now I've got a NH_Trimmer that will last for years without any fears of tears!",1
"Very good for that extremely dry skin. It's thick, not runny. It spreads easily. No scents, no dyes, nothing toxic about it, but it does leave behind a sticky feeling. It goes away by morning... but for a while there it's like you stick to everything. It serves its purpose though and seems to agree with sensitive skin.",1
Amazing..best flat iron,1
"Skiing in high altitude, with sun-drenched, snow-covered mountains requires the best protection on can get.  And, I found it with this product.  Used as directed for two weeks of skiing and I never burned; I'll be ording more!!!!!!",1
"Does not work at all, waste of money. just by their foam tanner or lotion instead.",0
"I was pretty much satisfied with my previous orders, but this time it seems like not original Paul Mitchell. The bottle is full of water, too liquid and it is not like my previous orders. More over it is not working on the Dry scalp like previous Paul Mitchell.",0
"I have used this product for years, but recently it has been taken off the retail market. I was happy to find it on line. However, the product is not the same at all. I am very disappointed that I am stuck with 2 expensive bottles. It is not the same formula. It does not live up to the purology superior hair care results. It is sitting on my shelf.",0
I read the reviews and ordered this product instead of the sedu blow dryer I was going to because it has such great reviews but it is not a great product. It is not very strong and takes twice as long as my other blow dryer to dry my hair. I am very disappointed in the product.,0
"Save your money. These curlers are heavy, difficult to work with and they BURNED my scalp. I've seen them for a lot more money but I wouldn't use them if they were FREE!",0
&Oacute;timo perfume,1
I'm pretty sure this is a knock off item because I've bought it DIRECTLY from the brand and it foamed and smelled very different.,0
left my hair too oily.. it may be good for normal to dry hair textures.,0
I highly recommend this stuff. It does exactly what it says it does. Put it on a pimple before bed and it either completely dries it out or at least reduces the amount of days you'll have to care for it. I would say though that you shouldn't try to layer too much on in each spot because it dries and sometimes too thick of an application will flake off.,1
There was no Paul Mitchell logo on the front bottom above the volume measurements. Going to assume this is some knock-off and not even attempt using it. Super shady stuff.,0
"Nice scent and cooling sensation is refreshing. I saw no change in ""love handles"" when coupling this product with weight loss regimen of healthier diet and increased exercise.",0
"powdery ,floral and too sweet. Maybe it's good for old person not for guy in his 30-40 . I was expecting more for this price . Gold is probably the worst of what Amouage makes.",0
I purchased 2 bottles.  One for my husband and one for my teenage grandson.  They both love it and I think the price  was fantastic!  Much better price than you could get in the retail stores.,1
did not do anything for my hair. very disappointed especially considering the price. i got a much cheaper product now that works waaay better. cant compare.,0
"It is very dry and flakey this time. I like it before, but I don't think I will order it anymore.",0
Bulky width doesn't work well,0
"I am IN LOVE with this line for oily skin. I had surgery a few years ago & the steroids ruined my skin & made it very oily. This line has saved my skin BIG TIME! I no longer have problems with my skin!! This also came in the mail very, very fast after I placed my order. Very satisfied!",1
"I love Chrome! I have used chrome for years, this was a good deal for the size of the bottle. Great smell, pairs nice with Dove Extra Fresh spray anti-antiperspirant",1
"i love this product. the first time i tried it was as a reccomendation of my hair dresser and i fell in love. it doesn't leave any oily residue and makes your hair smell, feel and look amazing. i even put it in my two-year old's hair!",1
Very good hair dryer.  Would buy it again.,0
"So let me start by saying I am a 511 heterosexual male who has been cursed with an overabundance of body hair and a hatred of it for a number of years. I am Caucasian (white) however I have what most refer to as medium complexion and my hair is dark brown. I start this way to let you know that I am just an average guy who wants to remove himself from the Sasquatch family and be comfortable in his own skin and that I fall into the range of not fair skinned/black hair which is the preferred mix for this to work optimally.

While Ive always hated my body hair and been subconscious of it, I just dealt with it for years as it wasn't acceptable for men to shave their bodies, with few exceptions none of which I aligned with. My push to finally go hairless happened when on a vacation at a resort in Cancun where there wasn't a body hair to be found with the exception of course being me  the gorilla in the pool. After that vacation I started my quest for hairlessness and began shaving body parts. It started with my back but since there was no real stopping point from the back to the shoulders to the torso etc. it quickly led to shaving my entire upper body. Which of course then led to my lower body looking odd given that it was still hairy yet the top was smooth and hairless. I quickly learned that using your typical razor (Gillette Fusion) was leaving my skin a mess and no pre or post shaving routines was helping resolve the issues. So I purchased several electric razors and have been shaving with them for several years now  daily. While the results are okay in that my skin looks good from a distance, there was always a certain level of stubble left behind which was annoying and left me wanting to do something more permanent  - a.) to get rid of the stubble and b.) to give me back a bunch of time not having to shave everyday.

Enter the Silkn Flash & GoIve now used this on several body parts as noted below and can definitely see that its working:
Arms  twice
Torso  once
1 Leg  3 times
My arms, I can now go 3-4 days before stubble starts to show up in some areas but most areas are free from new hair growth. The hair that grows back is very fine/soft and shaves off much easier than it did originally. Previously I would have to shave everyday or the stubble was visible and prickly.

My torso I just did yesterday so not much to report there yet, but Im expecting similar results to the other parts of my body.

My leg  yes I only did one leg because I wanted to compare it to the other one to see how much progress had been made. The third treatment was this morning so really for this review were talking about the results from 2 treatments. Similar to my arms, hair growth has subsided noticeably and what does grow back is very fine and soft and shaves off quickly and easily. Its also far less noticeable than the other leg after the same amount of time has passed after shaving. The untreated leg shows visible and prickly stubble the next day after shaving whereas the treated leg is much smoother and has far less noticeable hair.

It takes time to do the treatments as the window where the light that zaps your hair is very small. Do not expect this to be a one and done exercise as you will need to repeat the process several times as noted in the instructions. Because of the rate and quantity of hair growth for me, I accelerated the recommended treatment times from the instructions a bit. This is based on some reviews I read and saw for this product on YouTube from males. Ive experienced no negative results from doing this but would recommend you follow the instructions.

My original light is still going even after all of the treatments Ive performed. The package states this light is good for 5,000 zaps. Ive not counted how many zaps were fired but I can say Im surprised its still going given the amount of use its gotten. I did recently purchase the lifetime replacement bulb (good for 120,000 pulses) from another retailer (found it on clearance much cheaper than anywhere else) so I expect that eventually I will be hairless and smooth.

My advice if you want to be hair-freeget it and be patient. It will workit just takes time.",1
Fake product. Arrived with a crooked label that was already pealing off. Cream was the wrong color / consistency and doesn't smell as it should. I've used this product before and what was shipped was definitely not it.,0
Perfect color.  Fast shipping.,1
I was surprised it was very drying....I usually really like Paul Mitchell products but the one I did not care for..,0
Heats up quickly and is effective. Auto shut off is great.,1
"I have  worn  this perfume  since  1998 and love it. I have read  the  reviews  left by others  and it appears to not work  for everyone.  So, if you  have never  tried it by  a  trial  size. Most probably  you'll come  back  to Amazon  to buy this scent. Cause it smells so good  and everyone tells you how delicious you smell. Buy it today.",1
love this shampoo,1
I have been looking for a large barrel curling iron.  This is the perfect size  heats up quickly  recommend this to anyone with longer hair,1
"I knew that this product would not be without some tingling due to the acid, but I found it very uncomfortable. Also I did not find it very effective as well as it left my cuticles even drier than they were before.",0
I have negative experience with item: is that device doesn't have  same power and effectivity than before. I'm really disappointed.,0
"I had high hopes for this hair mask after reading the great reviews for it, but was severely disappointed. Like many other people on here, my hair is dry and damaged from dying/bleaching it so much. But unlike them, this stuff was far from a miracle for me. It actually makes my hair worse when I use it, somehow. It makes the hair cuticle all blown out and frizzy as hell and makes my hair feel like super dry straw. I thought this stuff was to help lock moisture in, not kick it out. Definitely won't be reordering. I wish it had worked for me like it did so many other people...",0
The only thing I like about this product is the smell. I got a sample of the Amika hair mask in a BirchBox order and liked it so I decided to try this product as I have naturally curly hair. This does absolutely nothing on dry or wet hair. I think it actually makes the curls worse and stick together in a goopy way. I would return it if I could.,0
"Not really WOW. I like the smell of eucalyptus and menthol, but can't say that I really feel them in full. Just a soap with some smell. Taking in consideration that this is my first experience, I am not really complaining.",1
My wife loves it.,1
"Do not buy it!
It brake after a short time, and no customer service. It is a waste of money!",0
"This is a very different type of foundation, very thick, it comes with a little spatula to remove some of the product for application.  This process did take a little getting used to for me, using the right amount and blending it evenly but once I got the hang of it it really did cover well and didn't use additional concealers with it.  I used a sponge to apply this and blend it for a nice even coverage, you could use your fingers, however if you are prone to breakouts or skin irritations then a sponge seems a better option for less oil and dirt. I used the Dermablend Powder over this foundation and it really set the look and lasted all day.",1
I am a fan of pureology products. I have very curly hair demanding a lot of moisture and a lot of slip. I thought that the company did a very poor job making this product compared to their other conditioners. The stuff I get from walmart (cantu Shea butter conditioner for natural hair) worked better on my hair and also is a lot cheaper then this product. I ended up giving this product to my sister for free because it was so terrible and having spent all that money on it I did not want to throw it away. I gave it a 2 star because it's pureology and normally their products are top of the line. Otherwise I would have giving it a 1 star.,0
Amazong works and looks great,1
"I usually love Dermablend for it's coverage and staying power. But, I felt this ""quick fix"" felt short. It looks caked on and does not last. Not too happy.",0
I thought this sounded like a good idea.  I watched the videos and thought I could do it.  I am not a person to take a lot of time with my hair.  I found this to be annoying.,0
"I bought the T3 blow dryer at sephora and needed a diffuser. The ones I had were too big. I bought this one thinking it would fit and the material it's made out of it looks fancy. Turns out it's too big as well, but I tried it anyway and it's amazing! No static, drys really fast and my curls are great! I don't care that it's too loose anymore. It's great!",1
"I love most of Jack Black's products but I feel like this one is a miss for me.  They call it a lather but it hardly lathers at all.  For the price, I want superior protection which I feel it did not provide so it looks like I'm going back to gels.",0
Loved the shampoo and conditioner by Love but the smoother made my hair straighter but coarse feeling.,0
"I bought this product based on the reviews. I am now honestly wondering if they are fake reviews. This product broke me out and, not only that, it made my normally oily skin extremely dry. I was not pleased with the consistency either. I feel like I have wasted my money because I have almost a full bottle which I can no longer use.",0
"Do not waste your money on this curling iron. I have been a big fan of Hot Tools products for years and they have lasted a long time. This iron however is complete garbage! I used it, it worked so I threw the box away and now after 3 uses it doesn't work at all. Won't heat up at all, stays completely cold!",0
This smelled horrible... totally artificial and chemical... and it was so expensive!,0
"It's not even worth one star...my fault anyway..after fourth one died on me after four mos, you think I rwould learn....but, NO....completely dies...go for another brand with thicker cord....",0
awesome stuff,1
"This serum is actually a lotion.  It smells OK, and is not irritating.
It goes on really smoothly but once it dries it sort of ""pills"" off which is why I gave it only two stars.
I did one side of my face with this and one side with<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NIVEA-Extended-Moisture-Body-Lotion-16-9-Ounce/dp/B00DG8EZKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NIVEA Extended Moisture Body Lotion, 16.9 Ounce</a>&nbsp;and couldn't tell the difference. Both sides felt less dry, both sides had the ""pilling"" issue.
I think it is a problem with lotions in general.
It is good that there were instructions on the Amazon site because there were no instructions on the bottle or box. The box had tiny print and more languages than I could count, but appears to be marketed mostly to Russia and eastern Europe.
The bottle says ""made in France.""",0
My husband loves this product for dry skin under his beard.  Although small bottle it does last quite a while.,1
This is the best stuff I have ever used without a doubt.,1
"I absolutely adore this lip gloss in Coral, but I thought Id try the product in Siren for the deep red. I guess because Coral is so similar to my actual lip color, I didn't realize how sheer the product really is, but when I put on Siren, it looked like I had smeared blood on my lips. In the tube, it looked fine. However, it wasn't a pleasant kind of sheer red that highlights the lips natural color, but just looked off and almost like dried blood when I had chapped lips. This might look better on people with darker skin tones, but Id look somewhere else for a red lip gloss if you're on the pale side like me.",0
"I love GHD.  I had one in Australia which I loved.  For some reason I feel this model is just not as good.  That being said, it is an awesome hairdryer.",1
"As effective as any are, short of surgery. It comes highly recommended by the plastic surgeon I have used. Excellent delivery.",1
"The duo lip pencil has a pretty combination of matte colors that looked great on my lips, and I can imagine would universally look nice on most skin tones. The wine has enough pigment that you can adjust the deepness by layering more or less. The rosewood is a soft, sophisticated nude that would go well with any lighter shades of lipstick. I have worn both colors by themselves since they spread well and stay put, and I usually just add a gloss on top. It is also scent-free, so won't compete with other fragrances.",1
"I read about this product online before purchasing.  It smells good, and thought it would be good for my ""mature"" skin.  I have oily, thick skin (told by my dermatologist recently) and was told that this stuff is like glue on skin.

I guess if you have really dry skin, it might be a good option, but not for someone like me.  I am a 54 yr old white female.
Tried to return it, but the expiration date had run out on Amazon.  I've never had to return anything from Amazon before.
It's $100 no matter where you purchase it, not really worth the money.",0
OK.,1
I have curly hair and this did nothing but tangle and pull on it. I'll stick to chasing my comb/brush with my straightener. I'm planning on giving this to my sister-in-law who has stick straight hair. Maybe she'll like it.,0
I found this at sport clips many moons ago and if you're a guy and you haven't tried it I'd highly recommend it. It provides more of a very gentle hold with conditioning properties but I use it in lieu of a paste/creme etc. which tends to be oily and greasy. You won't get that from this but on the flip side if you're looking for a strong hold you may be disappointed. It easily serves as a hand and body moisturizer and I've used it as an aftershave many a times. To me I really enjoy the scent of the paul mitchell tea tree products but some have mentioned they feel it's a medicinal smell.,1
Will NOT stay on the end of my blowdrier.,0
"Well, this is my first ever shave soap purchase so the only thing I could compare it to were products I've used such as shave gel/cream.  The price on eShave stuff is pretty high, so expectations should be equally high.  As you can see I've given it 4 stars, indicating it's not quite worth the money they are asking.  The product itself performs on par with the soaps & gels I've used in the past.  The MSRP on this is roughly equivalent to a 6-pack of shave gel.  Obviously, the price includes the nickel plated bowl, so with that factored out this should last about the same time as 4 cans of gel.  That test will take some time, hopefully I remember to update this review once I run out!",1
"This is a nice razor handle that appears to be well made for a long life.  I didn't care for how the blades are installed, but if you're OK with disassembling the head like that each time, I'm sure you'll be fine with it.  The handle is heavy, which all  the shaving nerds seem to love.  The longer handle might or might not be a plus depending on your preferences.  I bought this to shave my head, but ended not being able to commit to DE shaving.  I just couldn't justify the 20 minutes it took to shave my head and face versus the 5 minutes it takes with a cartridge razor.",1
Great,1
"I have purchased so many salon products over the years only to try to use them at home without getting the same results as the salon. This is the first product I have used that I can get the same look as when my hairdresser does it. I have frizzy hair and have to use a flat iron to keep it tame. With this Blow Out Spray, I can dry my hair and feel comfortable NOT using the flat iron. It does take some time to dry your hair right, but it is so soft when you do. I separate my hair in layers starting with the bottom and pin the rest on top of my head. I spray it then use a round brush to dry. Take the next layer down, spray, and dry. You don't need to use much and it smells wonderful.

If you spray it on your hand it feels like it might be oily, but it does not make my hair oily at all.

If I was allowed to own only one product for my hair, this would be it.",1
"This product feels like velvet on your lips .Doesn't feel sticky or gummy at all.  Great quality, and the perfect nude shade.",1
"Way overrated product, have the shampoo, conditioner and treatment... doesn't really do anything but make your hair smell fresh.",0
"Very nice fragrance. This is a first for me but was impressed by light, not overwhelming fragrance. Great gift giving idea, this has a unique appearance, an ample amount and scent that is fine for daily use. It's notable but not overwhelming - different than most. Has a hint of citrus with an earthy undertone....but not ""old hippy"". Refreshing!",1
"First of all, I would like to mention that there are a lot of B.S. reviewers for Billy Jealousy products. Funny how almost every product has at least one review from someone in Texas who alllways gives them a 5 star rating. Pretty lame if you ask me, but I digress.

This is a fantastic moisturizer that I have been using habitually for the last year. It feels really nice because it is a little thicker than most moisturizers. And when comparing to the other Billy Jealousy moisturizer, Combat Lines, there is no comparison. Combat Lines is oily, smelly, greasy, and gritty. Combination Code is thick and enveloping, but the smell is a little weird at first.

I know that the smell should not be a factor, but it sure makes it easy to put on my face!

In conclusion, this moisturizer has a great feel on my skin type (oily) and is nice and thick, which means a lot goes a long way. The last tube I had lasted about 3 months!
It moisturizes and doesn't leave an oily shine. Highly recommended.",1
This toner appears to be inspired by Korean toners which follow a similar philosophy of delivering potent ingredients without the stingy astringents that are found in american toners. Loving this product and use it immediately after cleaning. I follow it up with a serum and my favourite sleeping pack. I wish the pump was designed better it squirts a huge amount and splashes everywhere.,1
"Starting in my teens, I tried about every skin care product on the market in my quest for beautiful skin, but always ended up relying on makeup to cover the acne blemishes, enlarged pores and discolorations.  Then I discovered Glytone in my thirties, and now, almost 20 years later, people often stop me in the store or on the street to ask me what skin care products I use.  At age 53, I have the flawless skin that eluded me in my teens, and no longer need to hide behind makeup.  Beauty fads come and go, but I'm sticking with Glytone!",1
"Didn't do anything but dry out the skin surrounding my zits, which was a bummer.",0
This is the worst lip gloss I have ever had! It will hardly come out of the tube and barely goes on. So frustrated with it I almost threw it in the trash..,0
"This is a very simple, classic razor that works very well. Feels heavy and well-made. Very simple design. Does a close clean shave. Simple and easy to use. Allows you to shave without wasting plastic and polluting the planet with detritus from disposable razors. You can buy replacement metal blades quite inexpensively. It is a pleasure to use such a simple well-made product.",1
"This is a nice, gentle shampoo with a subtle honey-floral fragrance. It wouldn't be appropriate for deep cleaning, nor is it particularly good for really dry hair. I'd say it is best if you have normal or fine hair, or for toddler/children's hair.  My hair is normal, thick and color treated and it worked well for me. I only need a tiny bit of spray on conditioner after I used this product. It didn't cause any scalp irritation, nor did it leave my hair feeling weighed down. The consistency and color reminded me a bit of the Johnson & Johnson Baby shampoo, only this product seemed to actually cleanse my hair and smelled so much better.",1
"This stuff works really good. No complaints, it seems to be really good for the skin. I'm using with genius beauty.",1
Very good product,1
Best scent ever!!,1
"One star rating only because the item was listed as the deep pore cleansing brushes that I wanted, but when I received them they were actually the acne brush heads which are too soft for my skin.  Other than that, clarisonic is a great product and shipping was fast and on time.",0
"I use this bonnet hair dryer when I condition my hair.  I put a lot of conditioner on my head and then sit under the dryer for 30 minutes to activate the conditioner.  It works great.  I haven't had any problems.  It really stinks bad the first time you use it, but after that, it's fine.  I wouldn't want to try to use it if I were actually trying to dry my hair.  My hair is only shoulder length and it isn't dry after I sit under it for a half hour.  It's still damp, but it's not a problem for me because I'm just trying to activate the conditioner -- then I rinse it out anyway.",1
"I have oily sensitive and acne prone skin.  I am learning that scrubbing it is not a good idea for me. My skin will try to produce more oil and protect itself when scrubbed.  This is gentile but I had to stop using it just to figure out how to handle my particular skin.  Otherwise, I do love Pevonia products",1
I used the original Strivectin for about a year and I absolutely loved it. This new formula  is not the same. It is drying and irritates my skin. I can't even use it. I tried to initiate a return and never got a response from the seller.,0
Same as the original,1
I received the item with pump broken and top broken. I used it anyways. Hair is frizzy! Not happy,0
"Is this truly an Elchim? The last one I had lasted for 12 years and had so much power! I was a true fan. Ordered this and it had 2 power modes- slow and slower. It honestly worked less than a store-bought Conair or no name brand. Elchim, what happened???",0
Very dry. NOT dewy,0
great neutral color - get compliments every time I wear it,1
Great bronzer,1
"Not sure it's authentic.  Comes out as a stream not a spray. The ""Kenneth"" part of the Kenneth Cole writing on the bottle is smugged.",0
Too small!  Returned and got the next size up and rechargeable version!,0
The beads make your nails look funky.  Going to go with the straight polish.  Texture is too much.,0
Nice,1
"hard to apply, the black pencil fell out as soon as I used a sharpener... was disapointed",0
"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1
"I normally wear Mac Studio Fix, but thought that I would give this a try. Based on the reviews, I had pretty high hopes that it would be at least as good as Mac, but it was not even close. The powder settles into pores or fine lines rather quickly, giving it a streaky, splotchy look. This definitely does not offer the coverage or matte look that Mac does. My face looked oily and shiny within an hour or two of applying in the morning. I was very disappointed in this product and will not be buying it again.",0
"I've purchased several CND products and like them all but this color was terrible. I usually go for pale, natural looking colors but this goes on almost white and applied almost streaky. I haven't used it again",0
"I bought this product to help with my bumpy elbows and back of my thighs and rare end.  However, during the summer I shave my legs quite often.  A lot of times I will shave everyday.  The directions state that you should not use on recently shaved skin.  So I must ask, how and when can you use this product to see results? I tried to use it the evening and even the next day after shaving and was in total pain from the stinging and burning of my skin.",0
very wonderful,1
"After brushing for 10 days and more, I noticed no improvement.  I used it as directed for a little over ten days, brushed 2x a day, use the clear gel 2~3x a week, but I felt like I wasted my money as this product cost 2~3 times more than other whitening products but didn't do anything.

Maybe other people would have better luck with this product, I'm going for other ones.

Well... the good thing about this product was that it actually changed my habit of brushing my teeth before bed, so I guess something good came out of it.",0
"Good conditioner but not worth the price. I think there are many out there that works just as well for a fraction of the price. If it's even 25% cheaper, I would rate it higher.",1
It covers well - a bit overpriced.,1
"This color (tickled & bubbly) doesn't cover well.
It goes on streaked, no matter how many coats you put on.  I might as well throw it in the garbage.
I've ordered other colors (blaze, faye) that I love, but don't buy the color, tickled & bubbly.",0
"I've used the Ahava product before.  This crme was not as effective, perhaps because of the water element.  Previous product was oil based.",0
"Um, I don't know what I'm doing wrong but this stuff NEVER stays put for me.",0
Used to love this product. This is watery and runny and seems completely different. I wasted half the bottle just opening it. Seems to not be a genuine skyn Iceland product.,0
"September Update

Ultimately I was unable to continue using ANY of the products from JB. Emailed. The company is more interested in taking your $ and refuse to refund any of my purchases - even though I can't use any of them. So not only was I brushed off but I was outright told I could not get a refund even though they push clients to use the products passed the 45 day refund period. This company does not back their product. They will encourage you to use something else on their line OR continue using the acne kit, stating on the website, it can take several weeks (i.e. well over a month) to see if the ""purge"" will subside. A GOOD company would refund customers who are dissatisfied and having serious reactions to their products. I will warn you now, buy it, but be aware that getting a refund will be nearly impossible if your have problems.

********
Seems the good people at JB are too busy to address my issue with their product so I found it best to forewarn anyone thinking about trying this product of my experience thus far. I've been acne plagued for more than 2 count them 2 decades. I've tried everything with continued disappointment including anything my dermatologist recommended. I decided to get this on a whim and the first week or so it ""seemed"" to show improvement.

Now, many people say with a new product there may be a ""purging"" stage where the acne is cycling thru and eventually it'll leave you with better looking skin thereafter. So far my ""purge"" is the worst my acne has ever looked and is emerging in places I've never had acne. How can that be? One thing to tell me my regular acne or hidden acne will pop up faster during a purge, but explain the logic behind acne on parts of my face never seen? My face has been completely ravaged and I'm on my 2nd month.

When I posted something with JB hoping to get assistance, I got nothing, nana, zip. Seems they were just more happy to have suckered me into a 2nd month and didn't feel the need to help out someone who could potentially be a lifelong customer IF this horrible purge ever passes because I'm pretty determined. Instead, I'm left to assume it'll either get better in the next 30 days or I'll need to go to another product. If it improves I'll keep it - but as it's looking (which is pretty darn nasty at the moment) I'll likely employ their so-called return policy - again I just have to see if this purge is a myth or not. I've had similar breakouts, but nothing like this.

I've used this regime religiously - alas just getting worse for now - all over my forehead (never break out there), all over my jawline (painful, scarring red patches on both sides), all around my lips. I've pretty much had to cut out make up most days because it makes it look like scabbed, uneven pavement.

The product - ok, the facewash is good. Doesn't dry out your face the moment you towel it off. Smells kinda lemon-esk to me. Nothing to write home about - functional, more than enough to get you through several dozen washes. The serum - so far I'm not seeing any improvements related to the would-be acne fighter. A little goes a long way. The lotion is mighty sticky, weird, very oil-free - so much so it'll suck the surface of your skin dry. I find my face is oilier in the middle of the day using this regime. If it were really balancing it wouldn't be nearly like the oil slick that it is. I have to constantly blot my acne prone, combination skin with those oil-absorbing sheets. Didn't have to do that as often before.

I'm afraid by the time I finally ""grow out of"" my acne it'll be time for wrinkle cream. Anyway, overall the product seems fine - the only item out of the entire kit I'd repurchase at this point - considering I'm still in the dreaded purge - is the facial peel. I love the peel. I could just about eat it out of the jar. Again, I use it as recommended and it seems to help the acne (when applied at night). The morning after when I awake the acne appears diminished. Then a couple days later I have a whole new crop of white and red beauties to remind me this kit isn't working out very well. Be prepared to be snubbed by JB after they've gotten your money because that's how I feel.

I'll consider editing my review at the end of next month - I'll be officially through two whole months & we'll see where my face is then.

*****

August Update
Ultimately, I gave up using this kit other than the peel and the blemish clearing stick (which you'd buy separately). Only using up what I have left of the peel as I've found one made with similar ingredients for WAY less than what the standard jar costs. And ounce for ounce the stick isn't exceptional.

The products overall, I'm sad to say, never completely eliminated my problem: high cost - no real results. Had it, obviously I would be raving about it and not complaining about the cost (when you invest in the standard bottles). When will these companies get that if something really works people will happily pay for it - so long as it's reasonable? Anyway, I gave up on the all natural toner & have moved onto trying the Clinique acne kit in hopes it may slay my acne beast. But that's a new regime for me and thus I can't say for sure how it's going as of yet.

My JB purge was so damaging that my dark marks are still healing and I took a little break in-between the kits by washing with mild facewash and spot treating. Additionally, I developed noticeable blackheads which I'd never really had a problem with before JB.

Ideally, I'd like to think this JB kit could work for someone, but not if you have sensitive + oily skin. I'm assessing my ""purge"" was my skin reacting poorly to the product. However, many are vague as to how to distinguish between a reaction and a so called purge - if the purge actually exists, you know. Therefore, I suggest if you are breaking out in places you typically don't you may be having a poor reaction to something in the product. If you are an oil slick 30 days into ""testing"" a new regime, you're likely not acclimating to it well. That was the case for me anyway.",0
Did not work for me.,0
To thick  looks fake. Doesnt cover everything.,0
I usually love zoya but the formula Is awful..the color in the bottle is amazing but the polish dries matte and darkens in color when it dries so of course u can put a clear coat on to give it a shine but that dark color it dries into doesn't go away....so sad considering the color in the bottle is such a bright vivid magenta but dries into a dark magenta or plum. I do love other Zoyas though,0
"Wow. This Dermablend brand is amazing. I am no make up professional, but I have to say this cream cover goes on extremely well, and it covers any spot or blemish you have on your face. It does provide coverage, complete coverage. I found best used with an applicator. The tone matched the color extremely well, and it smoothes in nicely.",1
"Take care when opening carton, mine arrived with glass broken. I've tried to leave this under ""feedback"" but this product does not appear (all other products ordered in this package do).",0
"Not good.  Product was dry and flaking while trying to apply.  It was some what irritating to my eyes and left black flakes in my eyelashes and around my eyes after washing off.  The box my tube came in was open at the bottom, not sure why.  Also the mascara itself wasn't lengthening and definitely wasn't voluminous at all.  Worst of all the tubing mascaras I've tried.  Spend $2 more and get Beautenizer Fiberwig mascara if you want an excellent tubing mascara.  The loreal tubing mascara (double extend beauty tubes, red and white tube) is better than this one and it's only like $8.  So many better options.  I'm hoping to return it for a refund",0
"At first it was an amazing product, I was able to get AMAZING curls super easily.

 I only use it for events and it was a pretty good thing, until IT STOPPED WORKING (it won't turn on at all). Just before Christmas dinner, of course. I decided to wait and try again latter, it was still not working. Result? For the NYE party I had to go back to my old babyliss... Really frustrating...",0
I feel like my skin doesn't absorb this cream,0
It really works!  My lashes are long and full. Grandelash is on my must have list.,1
"I'm not very picky when it comes to shampoo. My hair is short, is thinner than it once was, and doesn't need the level of care that others' hair requires. With the exception of the shampoos that have a drying effect on the hair and scalp, most others will work okay for me.

Still, even though my needs are minimal, I try to change out my shampoos and use different varieties for the benefits they offer. Jack Black True Volume Thickening Shampoo has turned out to be a good choice for my hair. It's masculine scent, moderate thickness, and ability to add a small amount of shine and body to my hair make it just as good if not better than others.

This shampoo doesn't have any conditioners, so it shouldn't be used if that is what you need. Rather, it's an everyday shampoo, good for all hair types and it contains specific ingredients to help make the hair and scalp healthier and make hair a little thicker. I haven't noticed much difference in the area of thickening, but then again, I don't have a lot of hair remaining to thicken, so I cannot validate this claim. But I like the way my hair feels after using this shampoo and it seems to do the trick without any drying or other negative effects.

I will continue to use a variety of shampoos and Jack Black True Volume Shampoo is a product I will purchase again. I haven't noticed it at local stores, but I know it's available online and its ability to clean and protect the hair and scalp are more than sufficient to make it worthy of a try.",1
"Very difficult to apply unless you have an applicator with it.  Cannot see on top of my head, so hard to see if it covers the thin spots.  They really ought to come up with something better, since at least one out of three men and one out five women have thinning hair!",0
I love this line of products and this oil will not disappoint.  It's so light and I use it on my face and shaved head everyday.  Just back it up with some sunscreen.,1
Thanks,1
For My Hair doesn't work well.,1
I believe it works only for very minor hair loss. In my case it was just a black powder to cover the scalp.,0
"The product is too thick and streaky, does not have a nice, smooth application. I just tried to return it and found that it is a non-returnable item, so I emailed Amazon Customer Service. Will find out how they handle the situation.",0
"It didn't moisturize my skin at all, even though from childhood I have naturally dry skin like the Mojave Desert. It just sat on top of my skin and never got absorbed. Even when I put lukewarm water on my face first, this Obaji didn't penetrate my skin. What a waste of money. If it didn't get absorbed into my super--dry skin I can't imagine how useless it would be for a normal or oily-skinned person.",0
It smells fairly strong and I don't feel as if it gets my face very clean.,0
"Cant speak to the science, but it has me thoroughly convinced it does something. Acne around my mouth is mostly cleared up with regular use.",1
Smell like crap and its so sticky on the hair what a waste of money,0
I've bought the whole menscience line and their products are very good. I've been using Lab Series for many years and decided to try something different. I'm going back to Lab Series for a couple of the items because they fit my skin better. The Advanced face lotion is a bit too light for me to be used alone without the anti-aging serum. I also did not like that almost everything in menscience has a alpha hydroxy.,1
"I've been looking for the perfect shave cream for a while now.  I've tried all the big brands:  Billy Jealousy, Shaving Company, you name it.  I have sensitive skin and what something that lathers up nicely and doesn't make me smell like a girly man when I'm finished shaving.  This product almost fits the bill.  I'd prefer it lather up just a bit more but I will use this until I find something that is absolutely perfect.  This is the best I have tried to date.  Actually, I'm a fan of a lot of the Jack Black stuff.",1
"I always had excellent flawless skin, but lately it seems that my face could use some tinting. So in one of my trips to Europe I found a La Roche-Posay tinted sunscreen. And I loved it! As the sunscreen was getting to an end, I was trying to find the same one, but I couldn't. When I saw this EltaMd Uv. I was using the regular Elta, and I really liked because it is very thin and doesn't leave white streak marks on your face. So I decided to try. I was so happy I did! They are thicker than the regular Elta, and it contains acid hyaluronic in the formula.  I feel that it makes my skin look so much younger and there is no shine like the La Roche. Seems that the skin absorbs the sunscreen and make your face look so even. I think it works like a primer, I never used a primer, but it smoothes it out. However, if you have stains in your skin, it won't cover, you will need to use a concealer or some cover such as dermablend on the spots. I am about to order some more.",1
"Even tho I irdered this product before, I was dissatisfied. The color was so light I could not use it.",0
"This brush feels wonderful to the touch... but unfortunately won't fit on my Mia2. Its like the plastic holder for the brush is ever so slightly thicker than the sensitive brush it came with (and a grayish color, not white). Now Im afraid to try the radiance brush, as it might have the same problem. Cannot return - too much time went buy before I actually opened and tried to use it. :(",0
"I am a fan of Blinc products and frequently reorder mascara, eyebrow mousse, and will reorder primer.  I am a first-time user of the lash primer.",1
"Doesn't get very hot, but good airflow.  The plastic broke after a few months of use and I had to tape it together to hold the plastic in place.",0
"Arrived fast with prime shipping. However, I was super disappointed by the small size of the tube. If you remember the original strivectin that came out several years ago, the tube was big. Anyway this was too small for me to justify keeping. The scent is minty and clean which I really like, but the product is tacky and hard to smooth on, you would also not be able to use makeup over this as it remains ""sticky"". Too bad they couldn't just leave the original strivectin alone. I'm returning it",0
It seemed too watery compared to the one I bought from my derma,0
I use this product with the Mario Badescu acne facial cleanser and it has improved my skin tremendously. Thank you Mr. Badescu for your fantastic product.,1
Nothing special at all,0
I bought this contour palette because of the hype but I really am not enjoying it. I personally like the Anastasia Beverly Hills one more. This palette is all over the place. The contour shades are so pigmented it's a con and hard to blend. The shimmer highlight is so pale white in the most unflattering way and I don't see it working on any skin tone. The brush is horrible at blending and looks exactly like an elf brush with the lorac logo printed on it. Not to mention the product kickup is awful. It doesn't matter how light you tap your brush into the pan- it is going everywhere. Definitely not worth the money in my book.,0
"This is one of my favorite nail polishes that I own! Not only is it a nice duochrome color, but it lasts forever.",1
"Goes on smooth and stays put.  No strong flavor, and a nice gentle scent.  I love it... and it really helped heal my chapped lips.",1
"I purchased a St. Tropez mitt from Sephora and it lasted a long time. It was cheaper on amazon by about $1 so I ordered two, and they were a waste of money, after three uses the mitts fell apart - they rip completely at the seams. I thought maybe one was defective but when it happened with the second mitt I realized these were just bad quality and now I'm reading other peoples reviews and there mitts ripped too. Don't waste your money.",0
works great but I think you can get one of equal quality for much less money,1
"The instructions on this bottle are inadequate.  On the bottle it states the following:  ""Use:  Apply with fingertips, massaging in with a gentle circular motion. Carefully pat dry without rubbing. Rinse optional. For external use only.  High tolerance tested under dermatological control.  Use with or without rinsing.""  There is no way you can apply this product and pat it dry if what you want is to cleanse your skin.  I am a retired esthetician and am always looking  for a  good product.  After using it a few times I put it in the back of my cabinet and never went back to it again.  Unfortunately it is too late to return.",0
Lasts a long while. Feels and smells great.,1
Really liked the consistency of this product and used it every day til I saw it on the Today show as one of the products scientists said didn't really didn't protect you from the sun,0
"Wonderful hairdryer, I'm very happy with it.",1
I love this foundation. Its perfect for making your skin look even.,1
"Only had it for a day.. Curled nicely, seemed less damaging than my previous 10 year old conair curling iron I was using! My hair felt and looked silkier and shinier after using.. Although I was hoping the curl would hold longer. Super luxe looking curling iron",1
"It's nearly impossible to distribute this conditioner throughout your hair, so you just end up with spots of it and have to use a huge amount.  I will never use this product again.  Please don't waste your money!",0
"I'm sure its the combination of the base and top coat, but I love these products.  Keeps your polish on for a long time.",1
"Here's a hint: the bodyshop sells ""frizz ease"" for about $16 for 75ml, it is less sticky than Moroccan oil and I prefer it. Also if you ever go to Thailand you can get a similar product for 100 Thai Baht (about $3) in the Boots chemists that are everywhere. They have Brazil nut oil and lots of variations. I've found both of these tame my frizzy hair and give it a lovely shine better than Moroccan oil does. Can't believe what a chump I was to pay all that money for it!",0
Decent product but very slow shipping.,1
I'm fairly light complected- sometimes makes my face look 'muddy'.  I expect it to be way better once I get some color this summer!  Seriously really nice application though- easy to use.,1
Very nice would buy again. Holds up well in easy case. File groves to take off those pointy bits. Has rough & medium side which is great. I would give it a 5 star if it had a under nail cleaning hook.,1
Was purchased as a Christmas gift. This is a knock off of the original perfume. The bottle leaks and seemed less than full. It smells like rubbing alcohol. Unfortunately I missed my return window due to it being purchased in October but given in December as a gift. Do not waste your money.,0
"I love these bath salts, they do an amazing job of filling the bath with a lovely therapeutic aroma and are very beneficial for muscle tension. Major fan.",1
"It's a pretty color but when I think of a ""stain"" I think of something that last a lot longer.  This is off in minutes.",0
"Ive been using it for about 4months or more
On my happy trail and chin/lip/neck area
Not seeing any noticeable changes
I had really high hopes but unfortunately it just isn't working for me
I started out low level to the highest level gradually , every two weeks
My hair is super  dark& thick so maybe needs extra treatments . Im gonna continue to use And hope to see results",0
"At first I was following the instructions on how to use it, because I was having issues with my finger nails always chipping so easily. So I bought this hoping to make them a lot stronger. After using this product, there was no difference. If anything, my nails broke a lot easier. OPI is a good nail polish brand, but this product --- I'd recommend something else than this.",0
Th scent is minty and refreshing and the exfoliating beads really help cleanse my dry and sensitive scalp without being to harsh.,1
"It was a great blow dryer...maybe a little heavy but did everything it promised. However, it only lasted one year and then just quit putting out hot air.",0
"It works.  Wished they'd come out with a in between medium and light brown.  Medium is too dark, light makes your hair orangish.",1
"Amazing!
For face and brush cleaner",1
"I have been using Pevonia products for several years. They are good products but recently, they changed the packaging for several products and went very 'upscale' in the design. Pevonia decided to pay for the new packaging by reducing the amount of product such as this RS2 Gentle Cleanser. It used to be a generous 6.8 oz and now with the new packaging AT THE SAME PRICE...................a whopping 30% reduction to 4 oz.

I'm done with this line. My Dermatologist continues to preach topical products can only do so much and you don't need to spend a fortune on skin care. I will look for something new.",0
"If you're into unique, subtle scents, Calvin Klein's ck one is for you. It reminds me of unisex fragrances that had their heyday in the 90s. It's spicey, with the merest hint of a floral. I like it for myself, as a non-girly change of pace for my usual perfume of choice.

My husband likes it - but on me, not on him! We share everything, but we like smelling different!",1
Like alot,1
"Does not thicken, as if I didn't use any product at all. Very disappointed. This one says level 3, not sure if other radicals have different levels of strength? This one was ineffective.",0
"Not understanding the hype on this product at all- I've found way better mascaras elsewhere like Bobbie brown zoom lash....sorry
I also found the brush annoying",0
Not as good as the original Shaper which disappeared several years ago but is certainly a lot better than all the other stuff on the market that sets up like glue. At least I can run my fingers through my hair and brush it out without all the horrible tangles.,1
"I love Stila and I love these!! They look SUPER sexy! Love the colors too, easy to apply and easy to take off.",1
This product stopped working after 3 months of use. Now trying to figure out how to return.,0
"If you are wanting legit OPI nail polish DO NOT BUY! These are definitely fakes...the only reason I gave a 2 star is because the product you receive it not horrible, but not the real thing. I wish I would have paid $5 instead of the $11 for getting something that is not the REAL brand.",0
My hair (chin length and curly and coarse) looks best when I don't use a towel on it and let it air-dry. This diffuser seems to work OK - and if I place it against my scalp I can give myself a nice massage! Might not be good for my end result but it feels really nice!,1
"I absolutely love this product, this is the only product that leaves my curls feeling bouncy, soft and a very natural look. I can run my fingers through my hair, and there's no frizz! I've tried other products that leave my hair stiff without the curls and leaves my hair frizzy.",1
"I bought this a few years back when it was Kiss Me  by Blinc. Now it is just Blinc.  I used to just love this mascara. Now  it is way more flakey and not as easy to remove.  Long tubes that looked like actual lashes used to slide off when i used warm water to remove the mascara. Now  it is way harder to get it off and I just get little bits off at a time ,,, ie flakes!  I also get flakes on my face just wearing it during the day/night.  they must have changed the formula :(  I won't be buying this product again",0
Received the WRONG PRODUCT! No returns available?! This is unacceptable.,0
My hair has never had so much body...try it...you'll love it!  There is nothing better.  My hair is thinning and this has helped so much.,1
beautiful color,1
"Item delivered on time, was as described. Great!",1
"Its smooth and feels good and has a mild nice fragrance but it has done nothing and I'm not surprised. Nothing is going to fix creapy necks. Wishful thinking is so expensive. Things that work best for me are specific  neck exercise to create bloodflow, stay away from prolonged sunshine , watch your posture and eat healthy fats...We're all different and we all will age but let's do it slowly!",0
Daughter was very happy with this spray!,1
Great for your lips. Each night apply above lip line and on lips. Helps to prevent lines getting deeper.,1
"Not impressed.  Perhaps it's my fault for getting a 2-in-1 product but the conditioner leaves my hair greasy.  As a man with short hair, I'm switching back to just a shampoo.",0
"I originally got a sample of this and ended up loving it. It makes my hair shiny and silky, that's with letting it air dry. I gave it four stars because I find the price to be ridiculous.",1
Poorly designed. The buttons are on the inside of the handle so I kept accidentally changing the heat settings or turning it off. Used it twice and gave up and returned it. I'm going back to the Babyliss drier which cost more but is way more powerful and better designed.,0
"This is the most amazing stuff!  It really helps with big, deep cyst-like acne on my chin....it doesn't cure overnight but SO much better than anything else (prescription, dermatology or over the counter).",1
Terrible!!!!,0
love it,1
"This is NOT really OPI. I purchased and used and it was so hard to paint on my nails. It was like glue. I purchased OPI from Sallys later that day to try and it was completely different and better. You cannot return this item. Save your time and money.

"I normally do not like styling products as I have very fine hair and usually they do not work very well and leave my hair feeling sticky.  This product however does not do that.  It actually leaves my hair feeling clean and yet it does allow me to ""style"" and it holds it quite well.",1
For some reason this black plated one doesnt curl Ill go over it multiple times and by the time I get to the other side of the head the first half is already straight... Im a hairstylist of 12 years and I love hot tools irons but this one doesnt seem to work,0
Horrible,0
It is salty which is probably a good thing if you have imperfections on your face.,1
"The product I received within the Paul Mitchell box, was not the Paul Mitchell Pro Tools Express Ion Unclipped as advertised. It was a cheap generic version. Buyers beware.",0
Nice lotion for children,1
I thought I ordered dark brown never would have ordered black. But med brown doesn't work either.,0
This lotion is great for massage or for just after a shower. Keeps skin soft and smooth without having to reapply in a few hours. It is also good for massaging as it doesn't leave an oily residue.,1
/Good stuff.,1
"I have had this item for 4 months, and I haven't had the greatest results. I straightened my hair with it a couple times, but it made my hair very frizzy. It has been hard to curl with it, so I haven't succeeded. If it didn't make my thick brown hair super frizzy I would use it more. In all, it was a complete waste of $100",0
Great travel item for use in Spain!,1
"Texture: (2/5) Leaves my skin feeling dry.
Smell: (3/5) Powdery smell.
Foam: (2/5) Does not foam well.

I have tried both the Green Proraso and this one. But I prefer the green one. The green one makes my skin feel cool, doesn't dry up my skin, it has a good scent and foams well compare to this one.",0
"Maybe some lessening of hair, but not much. I don't think it is worth the price.",0
wrong color.,0
With consistant usage it will reduce cystic acne and not scar,1
Didn't make my hair look thicker. Did cover up the part in my hair somewhat.,0
Handle too short. You will be more comfortable with the longer handle razors because you are used to the longer handle on the disposables!,0
"I used this serum in addition to my normal skin routine (alba face wash, alba scrub, apple cider vinegar and water toner, roc night cream, roc eye cream)  I added this originally to my evening routine and did not see any results.  I do not have a problem with adult acne, just redness and uneven skin tone and was inform that this would help.  I then added it to my morning routine, and did not see any improvement in my results.  To be honest, I have gotten more results with my apple cider vinegar and water toner than this.  At the time, I was dropping my toner and using this instead (did not want to dry my skin out).  My skin tone got more uneven, so I stopped this and added my toner back in.  Needless to say I am returning this!",0
"Works on all hair types.  I have red, thick curly hair and my mom has dirty blond, straight fine hair and this product works with great results on both of us.",1

No like.,0
Drying. I think Davines is overrated,0
Loma does not guarantee products on Amazon.  Only in salons. Support your own beauty industry.,0
I didn't see much of a difference on my skin. My skin is naturally oily and it make my skin even more oily. Will not order again.,0
Didnt see much difference:(,0
I have very fair skin and this color shows up very well on my skin with only 1 small dusting.,1
"I use this conditioner and my first order was from the manufacturer directly. I have concerns THIS product, sold here, is not legit. I have two reasons - performance and smell.

This product has a very distinctive scent and it's completely missing from this tube. No scent at all - except typical conditioner smell. The scent on the product I bought direct form the manufacturer on their site is so fragrant I can smell it through to the next day.

Second, I've been using this for a few weeks now and my hair is like straw. When using the one I bought from the manufacturer, my hair was like silk. Nothing else in my hair routine has changed except going from one bottle to the next.

So, I LOVE Oribe Beautiful Hair Conditioner, but based on my past experience with using the product - I don't think that's what this is.",0
Ok,1
"I'm 62 and have tried everything.  If you're willing to give it a bit of time, like at least 6 weeks, you will see wonderful results.  StriVectin-SD won't ERASE the deeper lines on your face but it will soften them and it also gives your skin more moisture - I know it's not magic but it sure seems like it!",1
I was hoping this would show great results but it was not any different than what I had been using (Roc products). I did like the face wash. It worked well. The filler didn't do anything. The daily lotion is greasy. It never made me break out but way heavier than any product Ive used in the past. The eye cream brought back the dark circles I had gotten rid of with my previous lotion.,0
This is a wonderful... although it is rather expensive... Am disappointed to read that I cannot travel with this.,1
"Only conditioner I will use, works better then any I have tried before!",1
"The Zamac tip provides cool relief, soothe lips and boost microcirculation. The lip treatment is enriched with pumpkin seed oil and vitamin E to enrich, hydrate, sooth and plump lips. I was excited to try it but when I opened the cardboard box, the formula was all clumpy and impossible to come out.  The lip treatment also goes on sheer and leaves my lips smooth and soft. The lip treatment also had unappealing taste and scent. Definitely not one of my favorite lip treatments and a completely waste of money.",0
"It seems to hold fine but it has a nasty smell that I hated.  I didn't notice it when I bought it but once I put it in my hair I did, and if I had time I would have washed it out before my date.  I wore this on a date and she mentioned that it smelled like a toxic chemical.  There are better options.",0
"It works great, but its claim ""for all skin types"" is not correct. I actually have to supplement after applying this because its NOT moisturizing enough for dry skin. If it was richer for the dryer skintypes it would be my line for life. If you are not willing to supply extra moisturizer after the product, it will do the opposite of what you are hoping to achieve.",1
"messy it gets all over the place, it ruined my carpet in dressing room.",0
"Instead of the cleansing brush, I got the vitamin C weird stuff in my package. Please resend me the product!",0
"Works better than most straighteners Ive bought at the stores.
I have thick coarse medium  length hair so having to not constantly straighten multiple times through a section of hair saves time for me and makes my life that much easier getting ready in the morning.",1
I got a sampler from the AoS store after getting a Mercur 34C at the store.  I was very impressed since the blade I was using was a Personna SS blade used 3 times prior.  Shave was close and skin felt smooth.  I probably used a bit too much oil for the mix of the preshave oil and shave cream was something I was not ready for.  Cleanup chore was needed due to the oil. Nothing a little alcohol didn't cure. When time/funds alot for the splurge I will definitely consider the treat.,1
"Finally got my order and first impression..?  The bottle is HUGE!  Was not expecting that because I am familiar with Avene products and they are pricey even for a small tube of anything so for $20+ bucks I was expecting a tiny bottle..  And the bottle itself is AWESOME!  A really easy, hygienic and practical way to dispense this miracle cream!

I have terribly dry skin, lived in UK 25 years, Middle East 24 years and have now lived in Upstate NY 2 years and these climate changes have taken their toll and parched my facial skin completely.  To make matters worse I have started sunbed tanning again to get a little colour so you can imagine the mess! lol  well zoom forward to last night when my immediately recognisable brown box arrived on the porch and gave me the usual shivers of excitement.. well I ripped that itchy face off with a good lather and readied myself to apply this dream balm, which is really more a cream than balm.  Was there really magic in the bottle? HELL YES!  I can categorically unequivocally state that this is everything other reviewers say it is!  Wow.  I cannot believe how good my skin FEELS and LOOKS!  Even hubby, who notices nothing except if I forgot the mustard on his hotdog lol, noticed!!!  Now this was last night and I woke up this morning and my skin just looks HEALTHY!  like normal skin!!!!  Wrinkles are softened and I have a great colour.  This is HUGE.  I struggle every day to get the right balance of moisture for my skin.... I just hope like crazy that this persists and isn't a one night wonder... Will update in about a week.

BTW, this goes on quite slick so you think initially it might not become matt but it does, it all sinks in and leaves no residue.  Perfect for makeup application.  Jeez, I look good this morning and that NEVER happens.. sooooooo very happy, so is my skin!",1
Great body scrub - average shampoo/facial wash.  But the body wash aspect is amazing.,1
"greasy, leaves my skin shining, I was looking for  a matt finish",0
Seems like it is low quality maybe a fake cheap metal is just painted silver and flaking off after one use,0
Too harsh on my skin....too expensive.,1
"I don't recommend using this product. It has ingredients that cause cancer. Please don't use t if you care about yourself. Read the information, the sellers explained... ""don't use it without covering your face with sunscreen, sun proof clothes, etc."" Read before buying it.",0
"I really don't like saying this but I received a counterfeit product here. I've used the real product for yrs with good success . It always works well. When I started using this item, nothing happened. No lashes grew.
 I called my esthetician who lives in another town to order a tube from her for comparison. (By ordering from Amazon,I was just trying to save her the hassle of mailing me the GrandeLash-MD but I won't make that mistake again.) With the tube from her, lashes were growing within 3 days.
This packaging all looks authentic & the price is in line with the real product but I either received a tube filled with defective liquid or they're selling a counterfeit.
Review update: Someone replied that they called the company & were told it's only genuine if puchased  from amazon Luxury. I viewed my order & I purchased from amazon Luxury. To double check, I went to amazon Luxury & searched for GrandeLash. When the product was found in amazon Luxury the note, ""You purchased this in 3/18"" showed above the product. Amazon verifies I bought it in amazon Luxury.",0
Haven't seen an results yet and have been using faithfully everyday,0
"So pleased that I was able to obtain his great product at a lower price than my dermatologist. This is by far, my favorite nighttime moisturizer.",1
I am very fair and even the lightest shade of this foundation is too dark. As with many foundations it seems to have too much yellow in the base. The coverage is not as I had hoped either. I have good skin but this did not even cover my freckles. I will not purchase this again.,0
"Great color that adds a little iridescent sheen over any color. I always apply this on top of other colors, whether it's bright colors or a more neutral color. I just love this color.",1
It smells and feels different.  I hope I can return it and get my money back.  What was I thinking!,0
Simply a great product!,1

I have acne scars from my teen age years 30+ years ago and have noticed a lightening of them. Also brings youthfulness around my eyes. Just a bit pricey though.,1
"Noticeable improvement in face being less oily and I thought it was spendy but just a little nickle-size amount on the hand is all that they recommend using which means this will last quite a long time and I think it is cool that they don't recommend overusing it just to get you to buy more, which they kind of do that with their moisturizer.",1
"Please look at the actual GrandeLash MD website and see that the real product has only said ""eyelash formula"" for a while now. That is no longer an accurate way to determine if you received a fake item.

"I am in my early 40's and have been a Clinique user for 20 years.  I was looking for something to replace the product I was using on my neck as I was not happy with how it is beginning to sag.  Gravity is a beast!  I bought this upon the advice of my dermatologist and used it for 1 week on my neck and chest only.  In that short time, they both became rough and my neck sagged even more.  And it smells like play doh; unfortunately that isn't a smell that I like.  I am returning this product and will continue my quest to find a great neck firmer to avoid looking like a turkey as such a young age :-)",0

Use CND Spa-pedicure Cucumber Heel therapy all summer long for smoother heals in-between your pedicures.  Great price.  Salon price is double.,1

"The product is very good !  Used it for many years, but the postage on it is so high, I will never order again  !",0
Great product,1
Little more opaque than I was hoping for. Have to go over the line a few times before it's as dark as I want it. Seems like great quality stuff tho!,1
"I have thick frizz-prone 2C type hair, and I have a lot of it. I've been using this styling tool for about 2 months now and honestly cannot imagine going back to the days of a separate blow dryer and brush. For one, I'm just not that ambidextrous and, for two, my hair is really thick and it takes a long time to dry.

This is a great tool with a minimal learning curve involved for how to operate the buttons and which direction the brush should be spinning while you're looking in the mirror. Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it! And it your hair gets tangled, don't panic, just press the reverse button!

The only thing I wish was different about this product: MORE SIZES, PLEASE! 1-1/2"" and 1"" would be AMAZING!

The best piece of advice to make styling much faster and yield better results: Dry your hair with a normal blow dryer until it's 90% dry (no brush needed if you have my hair type or lower) and then switch over to this styling tool. Don't think of this as your sole drying tool; it's your styling tool, not your blow dryer.

Most professional stylists know that you need to remove the majority of the moisture from the hair before it will start to bend to your will (at least with my hair type). This method is healthier for the hair too because it dries faster. Less heat = less damage.

ENJOY!",1
did not match my hair color,0
Not like the one I bought in store much more watery in consistency.,0
Very watery. Sometimes clear liquid comes out before the foundation.,0
The product I received was damaged,0
I really like this product. It seems to fill my hair out so it looks fuller. I would recommend  this product to anyone with thinning hair.,1
This product did absolutely nothing for me. I drink 2 cups of coffee everyday and followed the instructions and saw no improvement with my stain.,0
"First of all... I have no idea why they call this ""anti-wrinkle concealer"", because that tagline undersells its versatility.

I'm 24, and in no danger of seeing wrinkles anytime soon. I've been using this concealer exclusively since high school. It covers everything, and with soft, DEWEY coverage, at that!

The tub lasts ages; in fact, I often feel the need to throw out a half-used tub just for hygiene's sake after a year or so and get a new one (since I've read you shouldn't keep products like this past 6 months or so). This concealer covers my occasional pimples, my mom's sun spots, my friend's freckles, and even embarrassing bruises (that I assure you were not the result of domestic abuse). I use it all the time for everything, and my friends even rummage through my makeup bag to steal a bit for their spots when we're out and about. All in all, this is a super effective concealer, and is really great if you have the occasional blemish that you want GONE from your sight immediately. I've even noticed that it soothes spots and helps them heal, whereas all those drying concealers that are for acne seem to just make them worse.

Don't be put off by the ""anti-wrinkle"" tagline and think this is just your mom's concealer; This is everyone's concealer!",1
"This thing is amazing! I was not paid for this review and bought at full price. I have very coarse, curly hair and it usually takes me almost 2 hours to blow dry and flat iron. My first time using this and it took under 30 minutes for a salon looking soft waves. Crazy!",1
"I'm 20 years old with pretty light skin that tans in the summer. After reading all the great reviews I was really excited to try this product. I first ordered the light/medium shade, but when I got it and tried it, it was way darker and more orange/pink than I expected. So I returned this shade and bought the fair/light shade. Turns out this shade makes me look like a vampire.

Besides the fact that the shades didn't work out, applying it was pretty bad. It is almost impossible to blend and dries as soon as you apply it and is too matte for me. After you (try to) rub it in, it  leaves weird texture and look on your skin, almost streaky.
It seems to work for some people, I have no idea how, but it could be worth a try for you but I wouldn't recommend it personally.",0
"This iron does a good job. And I really like the results I get. But the coating is already peeling off and I've used it all of about 20 times. :( And I take very, VERY good care of my things!",0
works well but makes my hair kinda stiff,1
Not as advertised. This is 1 oz but I was sent the newer container that only contains 0.5 oz! I got half the amount I paid for.,0
Didn't had the opportunity to See the full effect. I used about 1/4 bottle and it turned thick and gooey! Couldn't use anymore! Had to throw away!!,0
"This is the 5th Hot Tools curling iron I've bought. Not because they were defective or stopped working for any reason, but because I keep them in two residences, gave one to my daughter, and accidentally left two in hotels. One I've had for nearly 10 years, and it still works like new. They heat quickly-as advertised-in one minute. The only reason I gave a 4* rating is because they also get extremely hot. Do not EVER use the highest temperature setting because they will absolutely fry your hair. The first time I used one, it literally burned a couple of spots to a crisp. That being said, once I had the good sense to turn the heat down, they worked perfectly. They've never malfunctioned, and the hair is gripped tightly and doesn't slip out. This is a great product and well worth the money.",1
Have used it for 5 months --no changes yet,0
It looks like water.but I like it,1
"The only hair care I do is wash, condition, shake my head and let it air dry.  At my age, 74, I want to hold onto every strand so I use no harsh chemicals, heat, blowing, brushing, ironing,etc.

Conditioning is very important for my hair and must not be to heavy or fly away light.  I found the Klorane Conditioner, while shopping in Portugal, and it is perfect for my white dry hair.",1
Too yellow!  Looking for more of a soft cream.,0
This Cleanser smells really nice but does not work well for my Oily Skin.  Personally I would not use it again.  Doesn't keep my skin clean feeling.,0
love the product and got a good price,0
Smells great.,1
I should have questioned if it was real considering the price. It barely smells like anything and is no way the real thing. I can't return it either.,0
Curls good IF you can keep the clip,1
toooo grimey,0
works well,1
"Love this powder. Handy on the go/when you are in a rush. Good for my skin, looks great.",1
So I love this product but this week when I got a refil it showed up in the correct jar but that is most definitely not night seaweed night cream it's some sort of pink scrub. I guess you're better off going to a store.,0
I'll be going back to the Gillette irritation defense system that I was using before trying this out. It dried out my skin and caused some irritation while shaving that I hadn't experienced before.,0
It does nothing for baggy eyes except make them feel even more baggy.,0
Best clarifying shampoo on the market.,1
"Not actually sure if this does what it says yet, but make sure and read the fine print, this container is about the size of lip balm. 3 grams.",0
Tiniest lotion bottle ever. Great scent but very disappointed in the size for the price.,0
Best hair dryer out there.  Worth the money.,1
"This Radiance and Repair product seems to work.  I really like that it's a spray on formulae as I worry sometimes with the ""gloopy"" stuff that I'll use too much and it will be a problem to rinse it all out.  You basically just shampoo as usual, rinse, and spritz this Oribe on your hair and leave it for about 3 minutes.  That's it - then rinse it out and towel dry as usual.

The product is blue and has almost no odor so it doesn't linger or oppose your cologne or fragrance.  I really like this because so many products today have a strong smell, this just has a very light clean aroma. I must admit that I'm put off by the price point which for my lifestyle is our of teach. But it does what it claims to do - it helps with split ends and make your hair soft and shiny.",1
"Be careful - the texture of this powder is very loose. So I ended up using fingers to apply this only to cheekbones. If you use is as powder, you'd end up needing to wash your face to re-do your whole make up. NARS' Coppacabana multiple stick is 10000 times better.",0
Love it,1
"I am a Paul Mitchell product user for the last 10 + years, was very disappointed in this blow dryer. Like everyone else its touchy, awkward, heavy, it dries my hair weird, not the usual smoothing I can get with the T2 Feather weight,  but it gave out recently. Replacing it with T2 again. I really wanted to love it but sadly I couldn't.

Even my husband who could care less about a blow dryer tried it and he didn't like either.

Don't recommend!",0
too expensive for quality,0
It smells perfect and moisturizes my hands all day long with very small amount.,1
I was a bit bummed. It covered the whites at my temple well. But the whites on my part are more coarse and it wouldn't take to covering them.,0
"Bought as a gift this past christmas and 4 months later the heating element stopped working. Apparently however, buying any of their product online voids the warranty. Additionally, even if it WAS covered, you would be responsible for shipping costs as well as a $35 replacement fee. There are other straighteners just as good that have a legitimate warranty to back them.",0
"I love this - easy to put on, and stays put for a good portion of the day. Usually only have to reapply once.",1
"Great results. This is an soothing cleansing cream for sensitive skin. I love using it in the morning which prevents skin breakouts in the extreme weathers. However, I don't use it in the evening time because it doesn't clean the residues from makeup.",1
"Peeled off multiple nails within 48-72 hours, even after proper prepping.  Never had that happen with OPI, which I was looking to replace with a cruelty-free option.  Tried again, this time using a base coat that I've used for years  with good results and carefully prepping nails, still large-scale peeling in less than 5 days.  Base coats and top coats don't seem to matter.  Smells ok at least.  Dries quickly.  But will try something else.",0
The previous version of this styling cream had a bit more hold but I like that neither version leaves the hair oily or stiff.,1
This is almost a solid and not a wax.  Difficult to use.,0
"I am so happy to have come across this product. It has a nice, light scent that is not overpowering. I personally like that it does not generate a lot of suds and that it does not require a lot of the product so the bottle will last. This is a good thing as it is kind of pricy.

This product's best attribute is that it does not dry the skin nor leave an oily residue.

Sorry guys if this is a turn off for you, but as a woman it is so nice to have found a product with these qualities.",1
The only reason I don't like it is because it made me break out in hives. It was fine as a product to control my curls - worked well!,0
"Ive been using it for about 4months or more
On my happy trail and chin/lip/neck area
Not seeing any noticeable changes
I had really high hopes but unfortunately it just isn't working for me
I started out low level to the highest level gradually , every two weeks
My hair is super  dark& thick so maybe needs extra treatments . Im gonna continue to use And hope to see results",0
"I have owned a Helen of Troy before, and absolutely loved it because it was smooth and effortless when curling my hair.  I received this iron and immediately knew it wasn't the correct iron.  A Helen of Troy has the words ""Helen of Troy Professional Gold Series"" on the handle.  The iron sent to me by this company Red Carpet Distributor was not a Helen of Troy, and actually had ""Hot Tools"" on the handle, instead.  I contacted the company letting them know that this is not the iron that they are representing, and they argued to no end with me about it.  This is a horrible company, as far as customer service, and proper product representation.  I was so appalled how they argued with me about this being a Helen of Troy curling iron, and the words ""Helen of Troy"" were nowhere to be found anywhere on the box or iron!  I will provide a picture of what a true Helen of Troy looks like.  This company cannot be trusted and will refuse to refund your money, even though they have made a mistake, and still continue to say this is a Helen of Troy iron.  This iron they are selling doesn't even compare to a Helen of Troy, it doesn't curl like the Helen of Troy and isn't smooth.  You can buy a Helen of Troy at Sally Beauty Supply, because this is not one of them.  BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY!  THEY ARE DISHONEST AND LIE ABOUT THEIR PRODUCTS!  Thankfully, Amazon realized the mistake after I contacted them, and they kindly gave me my money back.  I wish Amazon was the only distributor on here, but since they are not, BEWARE of these third party sellers that refuse to refund your money, Red Carpet Distributor is one of these companies!!!!",0
Not received well. Not happy with result after brushing.,0
the fragrance makes my eyes water and i am sure i am getting MORE wrinkles from rubbing them.,0
"First 15-20 sprays of this were great. Nice and strong, I was told I needed to put less on with only one spritz. Now I'm finding the smell to be very weak and inconsistent. Disconcerting since the bottle is more than 95% full. I guess my only advice would be Caveat Emptor.",0
"I like the smell, I just expected an apple scent.  It smells like lemon/lime.  I guess its called Green Apple because it has apple juice in the ingredients.  The texture is nice and thick and does not leave a sticky feeling.  Its too early to see any skin-firming, but even if it doesnt, Ill still like it.",1
"After years of wearing MAC cosmetics, I had no idea what I was missing out on. With the MAC makeup I wore, my face would appear very matte and dry. I went into MAC a couple times and asked how i could correct this and they recommended bronzer, a finishing shine powder, primer, finishing spray....I bought it all. None did what I really wanted but I didn't know better. Dermablend has done exactly what I had been looking for. The finished product looks hydrated and natural, more of a satin finish. The application is super easy also. I watched a video on the Dermablend website which basically is 4 steps: 1) Put a small amount on the back of your hand 2) Dab it onto your face 3) Blend 4) Use setting powder. The coverage is medium to full and a little bit goes a long way. The pigment saturation had me wonderfully surprised. I felt like very little did a great job covering my freckles. I've never had a makeup cover so well without the cakey feeling. I have been telling everyone about this makeup after using it for over a week everyday. I love it!!",1
I do not use hair products often I really hate them actually but when I need too this stuff works well. It gives a good hold and is not itchy. A little goes a very long way.,1
"Upon receiving the product, it was very good. I even gave an excellent review on it. However after using it for 2 months, the iron does not it up at all even when the barrel continues to get heat.
Very disappointed with it. It was good but all of a sudden it just does not work anymore.",0
"My expectations for this product were pretty high. I love the Jack Black brand, and their fragrances. Pretty convenient packing / form factor for the deodorant as well. Product smells pretty good, and other reviews here on amazon were pretty positive. So, I took a chance and spent almost $15 on this single deodorant stick. The problem: it didn't work at all. I work in an office, and ended up with smelly pits by the end of the day. I was previously using Old Spice Hawkridge, which worked fantastically (and at a fraction of the price!). In short, this product ended up being a waste of my money. Don't waste your money on this, too!",0
"Great product, great price.",1
"Disappointing.  I have normal lashes - not long, but not too short.  Like all people, I want thicker, longer lashes.  This product just doesn't deliver well for me.  First, the weird shape of the wand makes it almost impossible to apply to all lashes - in fact, not even sure what the ""ball"" shape on the end is for because it seems useless.  Second, I don't like the mascara gel - goes on really thin and smudges easily - takes FOREVER to dry so it makes it easy to mess up application from the beginning or for it to smudge before drying.  I tried to put several layers on to make thicker, longer lashes but I just simply couldn't get it to cooperate. I just don't think I will purchase this in the future.",0
"I use this daily as my facial moisturizer under my makeup.  It doesn't leave a heavy or greasy feeling as some sunscreens do.  It only takes a very small amount.  I just purchased my second tube.  While it may seem expensive, the first tube lasted at least six months.",1
"It's a very natural looking powder addition between shampoos.
My doctor recommended this.
He knows his patients are pleased with this product.",1
An excellent product,1
This is a great product.  My only regret is that it does not have an automatic shut off for when I forget to unplug.,1
I am so disappointed. As many people have mentioned this container has different verbiage on it from the first one I ordered.  The one I previously ordered was amazing and I could tell right away the difference. I have been using this container for 2 months and not a single bit of difference.  It also stings my eyes.  Apparently it's too late to return now.  I am 100% convinced this product is fake and am so mad at myself for ordering when I had been warned by other buyers.  Buyer beware!!!,0
"It does decrease the wrinkles in my arms and legs, I will continue to use it.",1
gave it away. sub par product,0
Love this brand,1
Ripped after the first and only use.,0
OK,0
"Too rough on my skin, so definitely not for daily usage. And when I do use it, I can't use it for too long (5 sec. or less per area) otherwise it causes irritation.",0
I wanted NOT A PERFUME---received the wrong scent---MAD MADAME is way to STRONG !!!!! cannot use it at all.,0
"I was a bit daunted at the prospect of straightening my own hair, but I also didn't want to pay hundreds of dollars to have it done professionally, so I decided to give this product a shot.
It was not that hard to use, just time consuming. You wash and dry your hair, then apply the relaxer, pulling and combing the hair as straight as possible. After 20 minutes, you rinse thoroughly and then dry and meticulously flat-iron your hair.
While I was rinsing, I could already see that the curl was pretty much gone from my hair. Once dry and ironed, it looked sleek and smooth, though a bit dry.
Next step: I applied the neutralizer and again, combed the hair as straight as possible for 20 minutes.
Then it's rinse and dry, and flatiron again. My hair looked smooth, straight, shiny and polished.
You have to wait two days to wash your hair after this, and I admit I was afraid I would wash it and the curl would come back, but it didn't.
After using this product, it takes less than half the time it used to to style my hair straight in the morning. I can even let it air dry and instead of a curly, frizzy mess I get smooth hair with a very slight wave.
It was time consuming but well worth the price.
I will definitely be buying this again to use on new growth.",1
Extremely small amounts for the price! I'll be lucky if it even lasts a week.,0
Color is much more darker in reality. It doesn't look like on picture at all. It's purple not pink.,0
It does the job of removing hard water deposits on my hair.,1
"Extremely painful and after trying to use it 5 times now, I am not seeing any difference! Using the gel did not help with the pain at all!",0
great brow pencil,1
My son uses the Nioxin products as he has thinning hair and it has helped.  He has been using for over two years,1
"I first got this in a 'sample bag' and fell in love with it! It is not an oil you put on after the shower or bath, but a product you use while showering! It goes on as a soft and fragrant smelling (Nothing overwhelming!) lather that is very moisturizing! I usually step out of the shower and while still wet I slather on an oil-usually Burt's Bees Lemon or Neutrogena's Sesame Body Oil. With this, my skin is so moisturized right out of the shower, I can skip that step! It is the perfect mix of a cleansing lather and moisturizer; and I'm so thrilled to have found it! I almost gave it away as a Christmas present! LOL! Lucky me, I kept it for myself! :)",1
In person it's different then pic,0
"I tried this curling wand at several different temperatures for various amounts of time and it never curled my hair. It actually straightened it at times.
It gets very hot, very quickly and is comfortable to hold; it just didn't ever curl my hair.",0
This product didn't seem to do anything for me. I do like the lift and firm but I don't care for the smell of the products.  I went back to Paula's Choice products.,0
"After seeing how great it worked for my frie, I was super excited to try. It didn't work for me:(",0
It's not as gingery spicy as I was expecting. It doesn't foam up like mainstream toothpaste but I feel it gets the job done with a flavor alternative to mints.,1
"The iron simply doesn't curl and when they do, they didn't hold.",0
"I love this product. I can fill it with any type of nail polish remover and it works perfectly every time, cleaned every bit of nail polish. The hard tip helps clean-up a lot. Simply amazing.",1
"Great for sensitive, oily or combination skin. No break outs in years. No ruddiness and NO hideous gaping pores. (and you know what I mean) WHAT could be better than that?",1
Terrible.  It the same as an be purchased in a beauty supply store. Some is off with the formula- very drying to my hair.,0
"Don't know if it works or not cause couldn't stand using it. Smells like old lady. Horrible, gave it away",0
It doesn't dry my pimples in 1 night as it states. It also irritates my skin since it has a lot of alcohol and camphor.,0
"This brush was on my wish list forever until finally this last Christmas I received it a s gift. I was thrilled to finally try it and enjoy all the great skin benefits it was touted to offer. After all it's #1 Dermatologist recommended facial cleaning brush, it must be good right??

Fast forward two months later I wish I could return it. I feel bad for a person spending all this money for nothing. In short, this is one overpriced useless facial brush. Lots of hype and marketing, along with mostly useless online reviews. This brush will not transform your skin in any way so it's safe to say that you will spend $170+ for a facial brush that's comparable to a good detailed hand or face cloth wash. Even better, just buy one of those cheap spinning facial brushes for a really good results. I tried a quite few of them and they all work better than this brush.

For a reference I have combo skin with a very oily T-zone, large pores on my nose and chin, and generally sensitive skin. I take good care of my skin but it does require good cleansing and exfoliation to stay clear and clean and breakouts free. I use chemical exfoliators and anti ageing products so it's fair to say I'm not an amateur when it comes to skin care.

This brush vibrates, doesn't spin so there is no dirt removal action there whatsoever. It claims that vibrations will release dirt from the pores...trust me...it doesn't remove anything. Maybe if you spend 1 hour vibrating your face off you will see that effect, otherwise in a time you have to section off your face with a build in timer on this brush you will still see your blackheads when you are done. If you wear makeup you will need to wash your face first and then use this brush afterward to see the clean.
The bristles are too soft for any actual cleaning effect even if you attempt to manually move it around your face. If you follow the instructions on how to use this brush be prepared to spend extra time in the shower every morning waiting to vibrate your way across your face in sections. By the time the timer stops you will feel like you need to repeat the process again because it doesn't feel clean enough. Completely disappointing. For a $169 facial brush it's reasonable to expect more than basic facial wash. Needles to say that your expense doesn't end there as you will need to replace the brush head every three months (according to the manufacturer) to get the ""best results"". The brushes will set you back about $30 a piece.

Overall I would not recommend this brush to anyone. If you are looking to have a fancy facial brush in your beauty arsenal sure buy this. Otherwise there is really nothing else to it.

I had 100x better results with only one use of $20 product at home than two months of this.",0
Love it,1
"YES, I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE THIS HAND CREAM FIVE STARS AS YA'ALL HAVE.
ONE STAR RATING IS OVERLY GENEROUS.
MARIO'S DOES NOTHING TO HEAL HANDS.  THE ONLY THING YOU WILL GET IS A STRANGE FEELING ON YOUR SKIN AND THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED.",0
Got there very quickly. Was a little messy. Some had leaked out,1
"I had to return this due to the level of heat in the housing.  I could barely hold this in my hand and was worried that if I set it on my counter it would burn.  It worked great on my hair, but felt unsafe.  Perhaps there was an issue with my specific unit, but I did not re-purchase.",0
This product is very smooth and natural looking! I love that it goes into your skin with ease and blends extremely well with your foundation!,1
This stuff smells great but it is very chunky nothing like the stuff that I bought from the salon not sure if it's real or cut. Will be returning. And hopefully get replaced with authentic,0
"StriVectin has an amazing reputation and I was excited to give their High Potency Wrinkle Filler Lotion a try. I am nearing 30, have combination skin, and the beginnings of fine lines under my eyes and around my mouth. I used this product AM and PM diligently for two months prior to this review.

Pros:
- Convenient, small packaging. This is easy to toss in your overnight bag and the cap makes it impossible for leaks to happen.
- No odor. It's nice not to be overwhelmed with florals when applying skincare.
- Moisturizing and slightly plumping. When wearing on my trouble spots (under eyes and marionette lines), there is a slight improvement after applying makeup on top of the filler. Is this significantly better than a drugstore moisturizer? Hard to say.

Cons:
- A single pump will give you much more than you need (unless you want to slather your whole face). This is a downside when the price point is so high.
- There is a weird residue/film. Whether I'm using in the morning and covering with makeup, or wearing at night alone, there is always a layer of this lotion that become slimy when it reacts to water. It makes me wonder if it's really soaking into my skin and treating anything, or just filling in the lines like a pore-filler would. Either way, it seems to sit on top of the skin and never soak in.
- No long-term benefit. The improvement really seemed to be temporary as in, I could only tell a slight improvement when I was wearing it under makeup.",1
This is a great color and the service I received was terrific.  It was wrapped so elegantly and I received it so quickly.,1
"Fake product. I ordered 2, and it's completely different than all the others (same product) I've ever had. Different feel, and smell.",0
It made my skin break out and it wasn't organic or natural products. I saw a little difference in my skin but not really.,0
"Had this brand at the salon I went to for trendy cuts from pretty people... haha. It's expensive, but it's not heavy on your head, holds well with very little spray , and smells nice.",1
"If you buy this thinking this is a 2000W dryer, please keep this in mind.  Mathematically that is not possible.  A 2000W hair dryer running on a 110 circuit would draw 17 Amps of power.  The cord and plug used are designed for a maximum load of 15A.  So either their marketing folks have lied, which I hope is the case for SAFETY reasons, or this hair dryer is designed to draw more current than it's socket was designed for.  To truly draw 17A would require a 20A circuit and a 20A rated outlet with the weird plug that has a keyed sideways prong.

This is probably a good hair dryer but truth in marketing is gone.",0
If you have longer thick hair this does not work.,0
"product works very well, and this is much cheaper than at the spa where my wife used to buy this",1
Im a loyal user of chi silk infusion. This bottle appears to be diluted. The scent is off and my hair is not as smooth as it usually is after using.,0
LOVE IT!,1
I bought this for my fiance's 40th birthday and he loved it. He uses it when he travels and for the price it was a great deal compared to Nordstrom.,1
Made a great gift for a friends birthday! The color is beautiful! I would highly reccommend this product to anyone.,1
"For an oil free product I find this sunscreen very oily, its not in a lotion form. Also I noticed that it started to break out my face so I stopped using it. I'm still looking for a product that works for me.",0
"Worked well on my ""coily"", ""cottony"" textured, Black hair. Did not result in breakage and I'll keep using it. It left my hair my hair smooth like that of a doll baby, I was shocked! Lasts for about 5ish weeks......",1
"I have been flat ironing my hair for years. Finally I recently discovered the Keratin treatment and have loved it ever since. But once it starts to wear off, my hair needed some help to stay down. This straightening brush has low temperatures that allow smoothing your hair without the damage of a flat iron. I have also started using it to smooth my daughter's hair when I am braiding it or pulling it up. I don't need to use gel anymore to smother her bit of frizz. I love that it doesn't heat on the outside and that it is so easy to use. Highly recommended!",1
I love this OPI brand Infinite Shine. I bought the primer and top coat from Walmart and had been hunting for the right color. I chose the wrong one. This looks like Pepto Bismol on your fingers. It is thick and not natural looking at all. The Beige Is the Reason is a MUCH more natural look.,0
"I loved the old product, the MATTE daily defense sun screen with SPF 30 and zinc as the active ingredient. This new formulation is very greasy. I look shiny and my makeup does not apply well. I also don't feel like it protects my skin as well as the old version. The newly formulated matte version contains other active ingredients, and I prefer the zinc as the only ingredient. I will not be purchasing this again and will be in search of another matte product that contains zinc as the active ingredient. This is really too bad, as this WAS a fantastic product prior to reformulation. I am very willing to spend money on products that do a good job. I will finish off this tube, as it was quite pricey, and then move on.",0
"My initial review of this product wouldn't post because Amazin said It didn't meet guidelines. Not sure why. In so many words I stated product came with a safety seal under cap that was lifted. Not sure if product was authentic or not. I have never used this before but it is a thin creamy texture, not thick like a deep conditioner. I will take it to my salon to check the authenticity. 2 stars for leaving hair soft.",0
I had to return this product as it did nothing to conceal my skin's imperfections.  I do not recommend this product to any woman trying to conceal discolorations/melasma.,0
The best price i found.,1
"I found this setting powder to be one step too many in my morning makeup routine.  However, it is absolutely perfect.  Lovely coverage, brightner, smooth as silk powder, really wonderful product.

I use a giant facial brush to dust all over my face and neck to set all the makeup and powders.  You need to blend it in with the brush for a few seconds because it does go on a bit white but blends super easily - no worries there.

I just don't need it.  I am using the Dermablend Powder foundation and have found that just one powder is enough, I don't need the setting powder.

If you do feel the need for an awesome setting powder, I would highly recommend this one.  For me, it is just too many steps, and no noticeable benefit past the powder foundation.",1
"It curls, the heat settings are great BUT......it is the MOST awkward reverse clamp to use despite tutorials. I have tendinitis in my hand which makes grasping this handle which opens WAY out of the range a thumb or other digit can grasp it other than the way it is shown in the tutorials and strains my wrist. I have burnt myself numerous times. I wish it simply had a clamp like other curling irons, why the user unfriendly handles??? I wish I didn't buy this. I will purchase something else with a selection of heat settings.",0
Did absolutely nothing.,0
"Pretty disappointed in the way this nail polish started chipping after one day. I'm a huge nail polish addict, and my Sally Hansen Complete usually lasts many days. Not worth the money.",0
"I love the comb works exactly the way it said, made detangling much easier.",0
Expensive and stains your hands. Wont buy again will buy a different brand,0
"After trying it for the first tine,I learned that I don't like dry shampoo,  so I gave it away to a friend.",0
It seems like the tube is empty.,0
As soon as I stopped using it my hair started to fall out in chunks and is still doing so months later. FYI: this was not happening before I began using the product.,0
"I purchased the Mustela 2-in-1 Hair & Body Shampoo at a local drug store because I had a coupon that made the purchase cheaper than ordering it from Amazon. I had read all the positive reviews and made my purchase based on that. I can't really address how well the product cleanses because I could not get past the smell. So many reviews described the fragrance as pleasant or fresh. For me personally, it was overpowering and smelled more like chemicals than anything I would describe as pleasant. When I opened the tube, I put a small amount on the back of my hand to see what the texture and smell was like.  I found the smell so overwhelming that I immediately washed it off. My hand still smelled an hour later and I had to get another soap to wash the fragrance off my skin. I realize the perception of pleasant/unpleasant fragrances is a matter of personal preference. I wanted to let those reading the reviews know that not everyone would find the fragrance used in this product appealing.",0
"I can only rate this as far as my two-week use of it will go. I have to say that I do see a slight difference in dark spots. I have been taking very the best care of my skin that I possibly can, and this product from La Roche-Posay seemed to add positively to the effect that care produced. Have dark areas disappeared? Not really, but I think time may produce increased value for my purposes. There is some fading, and I am looking for increased change with longer use. Thus far, I would say recommended.",1
"This stuff does not melt on your lips, and the color is stark especially for a lip balm. If you have wrinkles on your lips, this balm runs.",0
Nice toner.,1
"One of the nicest hair dryers I have had so far. I would buy this one again. Love the long cord on it too, it helps a bunch getting my kids' (5 and 7) hair dry, since they can't stand still very well, so it gives me space to move. It definitely makes my hair looks nicer (smoother) than the other hair dryers I had.",1
I got this lotion from my fab fit fun box and I have to sing WOW this smells so good and my hands are so soft. I can't stop sniffing my hands and it's worth the price.,1
"Okay, I have purchased several Obagi products for my mom, she really likes the Obagi products. Up until now, I haven't tried it for myself because I find these sunscreen lotion to be overpriced (I am male)... So now that I have tried this, I really like the feel of the lotion, it doesn't feel heavy and the SPF 35 is nice for skin protection. I will use this product, but I still find it a bit too pricey for my taste for me to repurchase.",1
love it,1
The gel seems fine ( I don't know yet how much better than the regular one which is half the price!) but the applicator is a pain - my fingers hurt from the pressure I need to apply it.,0
"I've seen this set sold for more in other shops...definitely buy it on Amazon. This is a really good basic palette! If you need some neutral tones, go for it!",1
"I used this for a few weeks before some mint julep mask, and my acne cleared up fast. Now I can go out in public and not be afraid of showing off my face. No longer will I wear a balaclava at the beach.",1
I purchased this product only to come home and find out that on EWG's skin deep cosmetic database it has a very bad rating and it's toxic,0
As Expected,1
Didn't last as long as when buying from sephora directly... but not by much.,1
I hope this product helps keep my nail polish on longer... thought I would try it and see what happens.,1
"I have chemically relaxed hair and I did not like this for my hair. My hair is shoulder length and not fine but not thick either. This was too oily for my hair and weighed my hair down and made it look stiff. With African American hair I have never used a heat protectant or anything at all before straightening but that is also why my hair is severley heat damaged and breaking off not including the damage the relaxer alone does. With this it seems you have to be VERY careful I mean drop for drop careful. Maybe I never figured out exactly how much to use. Even a dime size amount was too much and after blow drying my hair was stiff and oily, not flowing and shiny. Just not for my hair type or texture. Still on the journey to find a heat protectant that is light enough for flowing hair but not oily and greasy so the search continues.........",0
Great!,1
"I ordered the parfum through Amazon and loved it.  Smells just like in department stores. This product smells totally different--harsh and burns my nose, not the soft delicious fragrance of the parfum. What a disappointment. Hope it can be returned or it will be thrown out!",0
"I never write reviews, but this product is amazing!! I am so self conscious if my thinning hair and this instantly and naturally covered my thinning spots perfectly!! totally worth every penny.",1
"Again, with the square head thing. Can I still return it?",0
it's a travel size. probably 2 uses at best!,0
This seller has the quickest shipping ever !! luv it I ordered this on the 15th and its at my home on the 17th also if your a fan of light fragrances this is key smells so clean and fresh yet not to over powering.,1
"tried it once and have never used it again, wasted of money and time",0
Great Product.. Great Shipping Thanks...,1
Does not warm up enough. Not suitable for long hair at all.,0
"I have been using Paul Mitchell for over 6 years, and I knew this was fake the moment I pumped it into my hand. It is not the same color, texture, smell, or quality. I have sensitive skin and scalp and the product broke my skin out and caused an awful burning/itchiness the moment it was applied. I am appalled at Amazon for making it their Amazon Choice when it is clearly a fake! I thought I was saving some money by not going to the salon but I know now that I can not trust Amazon choice nor the reviews for hair products. This is a FAKE and AWFUL. If I could give zero stars, I most definitely would.",0
This fragrance stands alone in my book.,1
Doesn't hold curl for long. Looks healthy and shiny tho,0
Different color what I expecting in the picture,0
I love this product. I use it under my regular foundation like a primer. It helps my base to go on smooth and look even throughout the day.,1
The product is okay. It's not as amazing as It's a Ten product. I won't buy again.,0
Enjoyed this foam very much it works for growing out style and older hair,1
"A little bit of highlighter goes A LONG WAY - so basically you'll be using this pallet for the rest of your life.

This goes on well, is CLEARLY present (so go easy), and adds a little bit of subtle brightness to your face.

This does not come with a brush or applicator of any kind, so I used a small brush I had from one of my sets. You could definitely use your ring finger too for blending, though.",1
"I can't live without my Evian spray and through Amazon and this seller I found the best prices ever. I use this during our extremely hot summers as a little cool down while out but I mainly use this before applying my moisturizer, serum and anything else on my face. Then another spritz after my makeup to set everything. It makes applying moisturizer and serums so much easier and helps to trap in additional much needed hydration.",1
Very good smelling cologne ..will be buying it again,1
"I have a chance to try a small sample of this product at a LPGA event and like it.
It goes on easy, non greasy, pleasant scent but is a little pricey.  I am wanting to and don't mind about applying to my face and neck every day after shaving, I am using some medicine which makes my skin sun sensitive and doctors recommend sun screen daily.  I do a lot of outdoor activities such as skiing, golfing, tennis and hiking.  I will strongly recommend this product to anyone desires to try it.
I give it a four stars instead 5 because it is is expensive compared to some other products.",1
"Meh, there are much better products on the market. I don't feel like it really enchanced my hair or protected it. I think the Bumble and Bumble invisible oil primer works wayyyyy better and I haven't found anything that compares yet.",0
Lies in cream form.,0
"I've been really satisfield with this curling iron.  It works really well and I would highly recommend to anyone.  I only gave 4 stars b/c it is a little heavy & the way the cord is attached to the base, is a little distracting at times.  Maybe I just need to get used to it?  Overall, I would recommend.",1
"This spray gives a great shine, be carful that you don't spray to much or it will make your hair look greasy, a quick spray all over is all you need and it gives a great shine all day. Nice smell to...",1
"I had my eye set on getting a Clarasonic and when they became available on Prime day, I knew I had to purchase. I debated between the Mia 1 and Mia 2 and decided to go with the 1 because it is cheaper and I did not really think an additional mode was all that necessary. After using the brush for about two weeks I can say I am so pleased. After the first use I noticed that my skin really did feel much more clean than it normally does when I wash my face by hand. I use my normal face wash that I have been using with it and it feels much more cooling and refreshed when I use the clarasonic versus my hands. I have also noticed when I go to tone my face there isn't any extra dirt coming off on the cotton ball like it does when I wash my face. When I purchased the brush I had a problem area on my right cheek that would not clear up and this brush has finally helped in doing so. I definitely feel that this brush is worth purchasing because my skin looks so much better and feels much softer and the Mia 1 will do just the trick. Also Nordstrom is having their anniversary sale right now and this brush is on sale for around the same price it went on for the Prime day sale!",1
"After about a week of using, it kept shorting out and turning off every few seconds. Very annoying. Returned.",0
"Scrub is very harsh, it felt as though it were scratching my skin. I use scrubs regularly and this was the harshest I've seen. Usually love Korres products.",0
"I've had great luck with this particular brand and this product is no different. It didn't dry my face out and left it smooth and lovely-feeling. Not much of a scent, which I appreciated (allergies).",1
just a dime sized dollop does the job for 2 days.  great price cleans and shines what more can you ask for?,1
Followed the directions to a T and barely saw any exfoliating. Only my back and a little on my arms and really was hoping for my legs.,0
Wonderful product.,1
"I ordered the smaller bottle to try out and instantly fell in love with it. The masking is so great that nobody really noticed my spot on the crown. It is better to wear it at night when going to functions....
I already ordered more from  this seller for my stock. This says more than anything I can put in words. Thanks",1
good,1
"The lotion is creamy and thick. The smell isn't overpowering or unpleasant. So far, I haven't seen any drastic skin changes, but it's a nice moisturizer.",1
I adore this over the regular nail filers. This makes my nails less brittle and works like a charm. I use it whenever I do my own manicures. Perfect for filing box shape!,1
"Some of Elemis' products are incredible, like the SOS for men.  This is just another moisturizer really.  Though everyone's skin is different I suppose.  SOS is better.",0
"THIS IS A FAKE. I've used this product for years. The real one will have no scent and will be very fluid. This one has a lemon smell, burns my eyes, and has a very thick lumpy consistency.",0
Expensive but worth it. Gives volume that lasts for two days.,1
"We received the sample size also and tested it on three different faces, my aging but clear face and two of my daughters one with moderate acne and the other with very minimal acne. We didn't find any noticeable results for their acne. For my own face, it was a bit cooling and left my face soft and hydrated for most of the day. For the price, I didn't feel it was effective or better than many inexpensive products that do the same.",0
I gave the Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Foaming Gel 4 stars because I have found it to be a bit drying on my dry sensitive skin.  However...that being said I use it 2x daily and have had no problems with eczema since I've been using it.  I use hydrating products after washing and always use Bioderma Atoderm Intensive Balm which is fabulous.moisturizer.,1
"My hair finally grew long enough so that all of the color could be cut out and I was left with with yellowish hair which I attributed to the horrifically high rust content of my water!  I purchased this conditioner to try to counteract that problem, and it did.  I will continue to use it as I am now--a few times per week.  I would hardly call it a conditioner, it leaves my hair very, very dry and I actually need to use another product to handle the conditioning if the hair itself. The smell is somewhat off-putting, but does not linger.  Having said all this, I purchased it to brighten my hair and to keep it from yellowing.  It does this well, and I will continue to use it,  In the interim I have tried other products which smelled better and did not dry out my hair.  However, they did not work.  Therefore....",1
I worked in cosmetics for years and love mascara but unfortunately this mascara was not what I expected. Won't buy again.,0
"I felt it does what it's intended to do, it protects your hair. I've used it thrice so far. It smells a bit weird (not bad though), but the smell isn't strong and fades away quickly. And it does weigh down your hair a bit, but only temporarily. Your hair's going to be back to normal in a couple of hours.",1
A male deodorant that contains Triclosan? It must be a joke as animal studies have shown that triclosan alters hormone regulation. I was looking for an alternative for my Calvin Klein One stick because the price.,0
legit,1
it was not what I expected,0

"Works great, fast shipping, good pricing, I have no complaints at all.",1
Works well on colour and smells really good.,1

"Ive always wanted to try an Anthony product, and decided to purchase this algae face cleanser. After about a year of using it, these are my thoughts:

Pros:
- applies easily and washes off easily.
- bottle lasts a long time, so not as expensive as it may seem.
- cool-looking aqua blue color.

Cons:
- The cleanser itself was nothing special. In terms of performance, it did as well as any cheap Neutrogena cleaner.
- The product gets stuck in the small dispenser hole and makes a blue mess on the top of the bottle. Youll have to wipe it down to keep it clean.
- Despite the blue marine color, it has an orange scent. Huh? Make it orange if you want to give it an orange scent. I expected a marine-like aquatic scent.

Ill finish out the existing bottle but won't buy it again.",0
"After being lazy, thus, unwilling to use toner on my face for about a year, I decided to give this a try. I've been using this toner for about two weeks now and so far I've noticed rosy cheeks, three pimples (this happens whenever I use something new but it usually goes away), and clearer and cleaner looking skin. Please don't discontinue this.",1
"I am so conflicted about this product! It really made my skin as a whole feel great, but I was still breaking out. Unfortunately while it's somewhat recommended for acne prone skin (as least unofficially) it has Isopropyl Myristate - which is known to clog pores (a whopping 5/5 on the Comedogenicity scale/ 3/5 for irritation). It's only one ingredient, so I can totally see how it would not affect all people with acne prone skin (you'd be amazed how many acne targeted products actually have ingredients known to clog pores!). Personally, I was using it for a year, but while I cut everything out I was still breaking out.  If you have your acne under control (or only have occasional acne), I believe this products benefits far outweigh the negatives of this ingredient. Still, I would recommend a NO if you're struggling with your skin and looking for a good 100% acne friendly night moisturizer/ regimen. OR, Mario, just take out that ingredient and I'll be right back buying this product!",1
Great product! Thank you!,1
It sucks and made me break out. Had to go to a dermatologist.,0
"Had this curling iron a little over three months. Turned it on as usual, giving it a few minutes to heat up. Came back in the room to a burning smell, and the black plastic tip had MELTED OFF!!! (I only had it set at 330 degrees).  Melted on my vanity, actually making a discolored area! Have read other reviews and I see I'm not the only one this has happened too. Will NEVER get another one of these!!",0
Good Quality,1
"Lathers well and has a very fresh scent. If you do not clean your razor thoroughly it will leave a thick coating. But it's well worth the money, as it is more of an investment.",1
The product appeared to not be a full contained.  I have been using for almost three weeks and see no change.  I will give it a few more weeks if there is anything left in the tube to see if it actually works.  After that time I ay change my rating.  Currently I am disappointed.,0
Same as the volumizing spray.  The more product I use the more my hair goes flat.  I was wanting volume.  This did not deliver.  I get better results with the cleansing conditioner and the mousse.,0
Perfect!! I have extensions and these are the only pencils I will use.,1
"I normally wear&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Brandt-Skincare-Pores-No-More-Pore-Refiner/dp/B002CO6ISU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Brandt Skincare Pores No More Pore Refiner</a>, but it was back-ordered, so I decided to try this Hint of Tint version instead.  I read reviews on another site where about half the people complained that this version was much too dark, and the other half sort of scolded those people by saying that they must be wearing too much and/or not rubbing it in enough.  I am fair-skinned, and even when using a tiny amount mixed with a moisturizer, and blending well, it still goes on way too dark - much more than a ""Hint of Tint.""  Aside from that, this is marketed and packaged as a tinted version of the original Pore Refiner.  The consistency of this version, however, was very creamy - like a liquid foundation.  Those who have used the original version know that it's consistency is similar to an airy mousse.  The original went on lightly, and it helped to minimize oiliness, something that is not happening with this tinted version.  So, don't assume that if you like the original Pore Refiner that you would like this one, too, since it seems like a completely different product.",0
Thanks .. looks great,1
"Not hydrating, also clogging and irritating. If you have clog prone, sensitive skin, stay away from this product.",0
"This gets five stars for the smooth, creamy application! Very nice shadow formula.

Three stars for the color, so I've split the difference and left four stars.

The purple is a vivid purple, not a greyed or smokey underhue. There is considerable shimmer, and if your eye area is the least bit rough or crinkled you aren't going to want this. Even with primer this formula made my eye area look my age.

I do love the quality and feel, it's right up there with Urban Decay",1
"After experimenting with at least three other brush heads, I decided this is the best one for me. I think it is the gentlest one short of the long-bristled, Luxe Cashmere head, which is almost too gentle. I have aging, mostly dry skin, so am going for a deep but gentle clean. I also love the beautiful dusty rose color which just so happens matches my unit! Ha.",1
Love this lip crayon.  Color is perfect and so smooth.  Looks great and will definately order another.,1
"Don't waste money on this if you want to see results! the shipping was quick but the product is worthless,it didn't do one of the things it said it did!!",0
"Great stuff, I use it many times per shift, as I work as a healthcare professional and am frequently washing my hands. This often led to dry, irritated skin. Not anymore! This is a repeat purchase for me.",1
Within a day or two your problem zit is gone! This stuff is legit no lie.,1
thanks,1
hard on my eyes.  Also I didn't find it all that moisturizing.,0
"I have ordered these products in the past frequently, all with no issues. However when I received this it had clearly been sitting on a shelf for quite some time. The product was extremely hard and not the normal consistency it usually is. Besides that, the shipping was fast and I will be purchasing again but probably from a different supplier.",0
"I read that this product has nitrogen in it, which would make this spray really cooling, but sadly, it isn't as cooling as I thought it would be. It is only cooling for like a minute after you spray this on your face. The micellar water on the other hand,  is great. That one really has a nice cooling effect.",1
"Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !",1
Felt great on eyes but didn't do much in the end,0
I have to conclude that powder is not the best way to cover gray roots around the face. Just too messy.,0
Buen producto. Excelente compra. Gracias...,1
Love the way my hair feels.  Not too heavy.,1
Eyeshadow and mascara are great...liquid eyeliner not so much.,1
"The color is more pink as I was expecting a bit more coral.  Worked great for my vacation in Hawaii.  Ladies were asking me how my makeup wasn't running down my face and theirs was.  I recommend it for performance, and the color if you enjoy more pinks.",1
This product caused my skin to breakout and I normally do not have acne at almost 40yrs. old. It could be from the dimethicone. Waste of money,0
Love the shampoo.,1
Terrible! The top part was missing on the bottle and the shampoo got all in the bag it came in. I had to throw away the almost empty bottle when it came in the mail. Major waste of money....,0
"Did nothing for my skin, and did not provide any hydrating effects.  If you have
mature 50+ skin like I do , this one did nothing for my skin. Very disappointed.
Returned for refund",0
"I first found this cream in a small boutique in Venice Beach Fla.
I use Retin A on my face & sometimes get so dry. This cream is the best for dry, chapped skin! I buy on Amazon every time i run out. It's awesome!",1
"So i admit i was expecting it to be a bit more gold because of the photo so because of that i'll take 1 star off cause details could have been a bit more specific. However, it is super pretty and blingy, mostly golds and orange so it gives off a mostly gold shimmer but theres a bit of silver and green and blue mixed in too (but gold is the main color). It goes on smooth and drys quickly, doesnt clump up like alot of nail polishes with a 2nd layer! Great product:)",1
My son uses the Nioxin products as he has thinning hair and it has helped.  He has been using for over two years,1
"I have tried every frizz-fighting serum on the market. I have a whole basketfull of these failures that I don't know what to do with.  THIS product was life-changing for me. Truly!  Those that have curly or frizzy hair will understand. My hair has never looked or felt better in my entire life, not even after I got that Brazilian Keratin treatment a few years ago.  AND for much less money than that treatment cost me.  Usually after I sleep on my hair, it gets frizzy again, but not this time:) I am truly thankful for this wonderful serum and highly recommend it to anyone.  I have very thick, long hair and it only took 3 pumps to tranform it into silky shiny curls.  Haven't blow-dried yet, as I only do that for special occasions, but can't wait to try that!

This product may seem expensive, but you don't need much, so it's really not at all.  And the fragrance is yummy.",1
"I started using this product about a month ago. I have curly hair, that had been in pretty good shape with the products I was using before. Someone gave me this product as a gift, and I have to say my hair has never been in worse condition. It's so dry. It looks great, but if you touch it it feels like straw. You should not put alcohol-based products in curly hair, ever.  If you want something that really works, use Khiel's cream with Silk Groom and a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.",0
Wonderful product. Cream is super soft and silky. Feels like silk as you're rubbing it in. The smell is very light and pleasant. The cream is white and doesn't leave any residue. Very happy with it and will be buying more.,1
"Fake! Love this product, but this is clearly a fake. Mine arrived with a homemade expiration date sticker sloppily stuck over the Replenix label. The silver pump looked different from the bottle I'm used to, and the bottom of the bottle looked strange. The serum was the normal brown/orange I'm used to but felt very different once I put it on my face. It stung and immediately dried out my skin. After 2 days use, I was left with dry red patches all over my face along with random breakouts. After discontinuing use of this, my face returned to normal.

VERY disappointed as I've ordered this from amazon prime many times. Be careful! Who knows what I put on my skin.",0
Received package in a timely manner. This is one of my new favorite scents!,1
This is my new favorite conditioner.  The light scent is very pleasant and it leaves my hair noticiably softer after I use it.  My only concern about this product is that it comes stamped with a date that looks conspicuously like an expiration date.  After a bit of research I learned that in South Korea beauty products  are often marked with the production date  rather than the expiry date.,1
Watch the return policy with Crabtree and Evelyn. They don't back up their products. Worst customer service for a defective product in years for me.,0
"The brush is HUGE, and barely useable except for the middle to thin end. Mascara is clumpy and I have to clean the brush and the opening of the mascara every few days due to gobs of clumped mascara. Won't buy again.",0
no,0
"I'm a hair stylist/barber. I use my blow dryer almost daily, multiple times a day. The drying power on the blow dryer is amazing, it's not too noisy compared to other blow dryers I've owned. It's a tad heavy, if you're not used to it, but I like to have the weight. I rarely use the ""Hot"" setting because it gets too hot, and the warm works good enough.  The nozzle does not stay on very well, which can be irritating when doing a blowout, but other than that, I love this blow dryer.
I owned an FHI before this, and it took a crap on me within a year or two. We'll see how this one holds up. I've had it only for 3 months now.",1
Love Eterniy,1
Do not like the scent!  Used only once then pitched it.,0
"It does have decent hold, but it smells like toxic waste. I'm usually not very sensitive to smells, but this stuff is just awful. It does have some fragrance, but it's as though it's just there to try to mask the foulness. Kind of the porta-potty concept, to be blunt. Steer clear.",0
Didn't really do anything.  No curl defining and minimal to nonexistent hold.  The only positive I have is that the scent was nice.,0
"Had this curling iron a little over three months. Turned it on as usual, giving it a few minutes to heat up. Came back in the room to a burning smell, and the black plastic tip had MELTED OFF!!! (I only had it set at 330 degrees).  Melted on my vanity, actually making a discolored area! Have read other reviews and I see I'm not the only one this has happened too. Will NEVER get another one of these!!",0
use it once a week,1
"Good color, good feel to it.  Only reservation is that the plastic container is not as strong as it should be.",1
"Scalp burned from this product , I got a rash on my scalp.",0
"I see a lot of mixed reviews on this product so I am thinking that whether or not this polish has staying power is most likely going to depend on your body chemistry.  My nail beds are oily and I have always had a big problem with polish staying on even with a dehydrator.  Gel polish has been the only thing that has worked for me, and honestly Shellac was not the brand that worked best.  Shellac would stay on about a week.

I thought I would give this a try since there were so many people it had worked for and one of the common complaints is that it drys out the nails too much.  In my case this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Unfortunately my experience with this product is no different than if I were using regular nail polish.

I painted my nails with the pink and it was chipped within two days, I redid my nails last night with the purple and I already have a chip on one of my nails. So for me this product does not work.

Your experience may be different and I think it is a crap shoot.  You're decision to purchase or not has to be on how willing you are to risk that you are wasting your money.",0
don't see any result and tired of looking.,0
Works great,1
"I don't know if I look any younger after using this, but my face feels great. And its a nice soothing buzz to wash my face and use this. My two nitpicks: I wish it had a charging base because I don't like loose charging cables around my bathroom and I wish you could adjust the strength of the vibration during use. Right now you press +/- then the start button.",1
Love it.  Goes on easily does not clump.  ,1
"Very Bad!!! hasn't emergency bottom to stop, then you'll end up cutting your hair to open.",0
"Obviously, you are spending more money than one really should on a blow drier, so one should get a great blow. This delivers, however, the buttons are in such an awkward place, that when you move it around, your fingers knock the heat settings from hot to cold fairly easily. However, it is a great blow drier overall. I'm not a professional, so I haven't used that many, but the weight is good, not too loud, and seems to work quickly.",1
Always great,1
You definitely need to add more than 2 coats. Super sheer and my nail shows through. I'd resell it if I could,0
"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  I'm 60 years old and it has markedly approved the appearance of crows feet.  Mine were not too bad to begin with, but the eye cream has definitely worked for me!!  I've tried all kinds of high and low end eye creams, some costing a fortune.  This is by far the best!",1
The best value for rose water spray! I use this to hydrate my face and it gives me a fresh glow when I mist it over my makeup. The scent is not too overpowering and does not cause any problems for my quasi-sensitive skin.,1
"I bought this item after reading all the great reviews.  I Received this item on time, no complaints there.  Unfortunately, it really isn't having that great of an impact on my skin.  For the cost, it isn't worth it.",0
This isn't good for anyone expecting coverage.,0
"As an 84 year old man, this works very nicely on my skin.  The scent is not too strong.  It leaves my face feeling fresh and rejuvenated.  The price is a bit prohibitive though, especially for those on social security incomes.  Otherwise, I can recommend it highly.",1
"The cartridge, the number of pulse were less than 200 and after two times use, it did not work.",0
"Absolutely LOVE Paul Mitchell Soft Sculpting Spray Gel!
Be so blessed on this beautiful Spring day!",1
That wasn t good,0
I purchased a sample and really like it. It makes the skin on my neck feel very smooth. Not sure if it makes it any more youthful outside of that.  I didn't purchase the full-sized cream because of the price. I just don't think it's THAT terrific.,1
I was actually allergic to it.  Broke out in a rash.,0
"The smell is not great. I also noticed that I lost a lot of hair in the shower as I was washing off the shampoo. My hair feels squeaky clean to the point where it dries out because the shampoo has taken off all the natural oils and my hair over compensates by making more oil to the point where after a few hours, my hair is already starting to look oily.",0
"I bought this thinking it was a foundation.. although I didn't read the full description. Once I put it on, I realized it was not meant for your entire face. It is a nice cover up though and I just mixed it with a darker foundation and use it like that. It seems to make my skin just a bit dry so I would use a good moisturizer at night. The color I chose is a bit lighter than I thought but like I said, I mixed it with a darker foundation so it is fine. It's a pretty small bottle for the price but I know that it's an expensive brand. The product is fine and I like it okay but I probably wouldn't spend the $25 on this again.",1
"i got the fat one, the more i use it the more comfortable i get. works beautiful for beach waves.",1
"Great design!.  So compact compared to those large metal contraptions!  Works great, just remember it is plastic and don't squeeze too hard.",1
This shampoo does nothing special and in s over priced.,0
very good product,1
I love all coola products. This however had the consistency of the correct product but felt like it had sand in it.... it felt like an exfoliating scrub. I tried to use it as long as I could but my face was raw after a few days. I will continue to buy my coola products directly from birchbox as to avoid wasting money.,0
Terrible pigmentation. Worst liner ever.,0
I wanted to love this but it made me and my son develop a terrible (not itchy) rash that lasted days. I used it liberally and often for an afternoon on the water and I do not feel it worked AT ALL.,0
This is the third order I have placed for this product. My wife uses them every night. They perform well for her. I have never had to return any of these,1
"I get some samples of various La Roche-Posay products at my dermatologist's office last week. He endorses them highly. I tried this medicated gel cleanser and thought it was refreshing and effective but also slightly drying because I have naturally dry skin in the winter months. I recommend it but suggest you also use a light moisturizer after use. It cleared up a small outbreak in a couple of days, but the moisturizer kept my skin supple and soft.",1
"Really like product, but packaging is horrible. Do not like long tube at all. I agree with the other review...wasteful packaging.",1
"Well the shipping went great, came before the expected date in perfect condition. :) I'm not sure about the product quite yet, I've only used it about once. it seems really nice. it's really silky and sparkly. does help with some of my redness. However, I do have a little bit of acne and dark marks from it, that doesn't dull with the product(let alone my foundation). other than that pretty good :)",1
Jury is still out on this!,0
Smooth and good coverage,1
"Love the scent, but doesn't last long.",1
"First, the pump for this item clogs and becomes unusable!  After numerous comments to this company regarding the pump and the loss of product because of the situation, they have not listened and are still packaging the product in the same manner.  Second.  It doesn't work!",0
"Great products....only need a dab and my face is nice and glossy.
Mary Elizabeth Blaney",1
"There were so many good reviews I was very much looking forward to using this product. I tried and tried but it does not work. It does absolutely nothing! I am thinking maybe I received a bogus jar of this product. Very sad that I tried for too long. Now, it's too late to return  this product. I must be that one person that this product has no effect. :(",0
"I gave 3 stars because the pwoder is not ""packed"" tight in the contact. As soon as applying, there is powder everywhere and I am wasting a lot of pwoder that doesn't end up on my face. But happy with what does get applied !",0
Not sure it's authentic :( .  Darker in color then normal and doesn't appear to have same texture and feel as before,0
"I like the crayon itself, but it's completely useless after the first couple of uses. There are instructional videos showing how to sharpen this crayon, using a built in sharpener in the lid. There is no sharpener in the lid. Apparently they decided that it was better for them to force customers to buy a completely separate sharpener, for another $10. For $10 I will buy a new crayon that can be sharpened with a sharpener that I already own instead of being forced to buy another one.",0
A great brush. I think the longer bristles combined with the boar-style bristles is the best combo for a styling brush.,1
"The item arrived in great condition.  However, I do not care for the hair spray.  It produces a very strong odor that does not go away in the air or the hair.  Also, it doesn't have a very good hold unless you really use a lot.  It's a very light hold, which for me is not what I need.",0
It personally does not keep my face moist for more than an hour. I have to re-apply more than twice a day. Gold Bond has worked better than this for me.,0
"The barrel is larger than I thought it would be, but it still straightens and turns the ends which is just what i wanted.",1
no need to explain I threw down the toilet a waste of money for sure/// I use EltaMD sunblock and its the best but this stuff sucked big time.,0
"Love zoya products. Vegan. Safe. No harmful ingredients or chemicals
Amazing nude color",1
Too dark.,0
"Don't waste your money - the only thing this cream does is help hydrate a little, which I'm sure you get with a cheaper cream.",0
Ok,1
The product expired and smells like garlic.  It has turned probably too old to be sold,0
great smell...i like it,1
"I want to love this product, but it breaks me out whenever I try to use it.  Unfortunately it is part of a bucket of products I don't use.",0
"This flat iron is pretty awesome. You can set the specific temp depending on your hair type, it heats up and cools down really fast. I have thin but wavy hair and it straightens it well on 345. I didn't really find that it made my hair especially shiny, sleek, smooth or less frizzy but I got it to straighten my hair so its ok. It also never snags my hair which makes the whole hair straightening task less annoying. Overall, its a good little flat iron at an awesomely affordable price.  Way better than my last one.",1
Have had my  NuBrilliance for over three years and have found it very effective. Easy to use and great results.,1
"It moisturizes but it's slightly greasy and I haven't noticed any lightening of a particular sun damage spot on the top of my hand . Given the price, this should have made an impact by now . . . . If I don't purchase a product directly from a manufacturer, I always get around to contacting the manufacturer with their product code to ensure freshness. I called NIA 24 with the product code listed on the container and they told me to ask the seller. I contacted the seller (who is an authorized NIA 24 retailer and one of the retailers I have gotten 1 expired product from in the past ) and they had no idea how to decipher NIA 24's codes and referred me back to NIA 24. On my second call to NIA 24, I explained all of the above INCLUDING that I had gotten an expired product from this retailer in the past and NIA 24 said ""nothing ships out from us that isn't fresh "" and again, refused to give me the dates . Of concern - NIA 24 can not possibly know how long a retailer has had a product stored on a warehouse shelf, therefor it doesn't matter how fresh the product was when NIA 24 shipped it to the retalier, if the retailer didn't rotate in the warehouse, and it definitely happens, then a product could expire. Considering NIA 24 sells numerous sunscreen products, it's unimaginable that a consumer can not get this information from this company. Stability of a sunscreen product is of the utmost of importance. I have checked codes from products sold at many reputable retailers both online and brick and mortar and found 3 expired products in the past 5 years or so, I know this isn't many but if I'm paying this kind of money, I want to know I'm getting a stable, fresh product. Out of probably 20-25 manufacturers I have called over the years,  NIA 24 is the first manufacturer to deny this information.",0
"This razor is awesome. I have tried a few others (Mekur 34c, Razorock German 37 slant, and a handle bar shaving company prospector). All were DE razors. None compare to the results I get from this razor. It is mild enough on setting 1 and very aggressive on 6. If you have experience with DE razors, all setting are manageable. Don't be scared to purchase this razor. You will be satisfied. The razor looks great, but could use some knurling on the handle. That is the only reason it isn't marked as a 5 star.",1
heats up quickly and does a good job for its size.,1
Excelente recomendo.,1
"I bought this product with confidence knowing that it was Pureology brand but I was sadly disappointed. A few sprays made my hair immediately look greasy, like I hadn't washed it in 2 days. It became stringy and nothing could bring it back. I think I'd rather have duller, less shiney looking hair as opposed to the outcome this product gives. Glad I only bought the small bottle and didn't waste more money.",0
love it  its works,1
"It curls quickly and the curls hold for at least two days without hairspray (much more effective than a regular curling iron). I find that after you twist the hair it takes 5-10 seconds for the curl to set on the medium setting. The glove is stupid. I threw it away because it is itchy and irritating. I think it is better to just develop the habit of keeping a safe distance with your fingers. I've been burned once or twice but it wasn't a huge issue, and I learned quickly much like Skinner's rat. I wish they had a larger size available-- I purchsed the 1 1\4  but I sometimes like larger waves.",1
I like it,1
Very nice,1
Use annually.  love the product.,1
Always  use.  Great product.,1
Made my skin break out worse. :(,0
"I was really excited about the concept of this product, as I am a powdered dry shampoo user in the interest of saving water, and thought this couch be a nice tool in my product collection, but it is truly awful.  I could see this being POSSIBLY useful for someone with really short hair who wants to skip a wash and have some lift if used JUST in the roots, but even that is hard for me to picture being manageable.  The product is so sticky and grainy that while it does have the effect of removing oil, what's left in your hair is way grosser than oil.  It might look passable, but it feels just terrible, my hairbrush stuck in it and it broke my hair, I couldn't wash it off my hands and after THREE shampoos, I could still feel it in my hair (getting a comb stuck in it), and that was all using a TINY amount, and rubbing it well between my fingers before applying it sparingly.

I used it once and thought it was gross but decided to at least play with it once more before a shower in case I had used too much or hadn't thinned it enough, but no, it was still awful.

As others have said, the smell is nice enough but not overpowering, which is the only nice thing to say about this product.  I am certainly glad this was a review item.. if I had paid the crazy price for this I would be returning it for my money back.",0
"I received mine today. The shipping box was fine, but the flash n go had been used and parts were missing. Very disappointed.",0
"Maybe it's me, but it was terrible for me.  I gave it 3 weeks, but I could not stand smelling my pits any longer; I had to go back to my former deodorant.",0
I have used this product for 2 years and I can tell that this is not an authentic Milk Shake product.  The smell is completely different! I should have known by the price that this wasn't the real deal. Not worth the $5 savings at all!,0
great!,1
Too expensive,0
"Cheap plastic parts earns this razor low star rating. I wish Merkur would catch a clue....everyone hates the knob. People even pay up to $180 for aftermarket replacement knobs just to get rid of the plastic.
**Update** I hated the ugly knob so much I soaked it overnight in Black Rit dye at a very strong concentration. Not the knob is nice and black and looks like it came from the factory that way. I saw people used Rit dye to dye plastic radio controlled car parts. So gave it a try in the knob, it worked great. Since the knob is off-white you could probably dye it any color you want.",0
Definitely extends the life and look of your keratin treatment. Smells pleasant too.  Better value in the bigger size...I bout this one for travel,1
This product works but you need to use it regularly - at least 3-4 times a week to see results.  The more you use it the more pronounced the results will be!,1
Fabulous product!!! Makes my hair so soft and manageable!!,1
"If you have never tried this product, your best bet would be to go to where they sell it and try it first and compare colors.  I ordered the medium.  It is too light and VERY YELLOW.  I should have listened to the other reviewers that stated this. I got the BB#7. The color tone is actually quite ridiculously yellow.  I don't see that many people out in the world that have yellow skin so I am dumbfounded at how this wears.  After applying too much with first application, I went to website and watched application video.  I needed about 25% of what I applied.  I like the dried finish of the product, just not the color.  This is way too expensive to find that out after I have opened it and used it.  I will probably try and mix it in with my usual Boots No 7 Beautifully Matte in the winter when my skin is paler, so I'm not out the entire 50 bucks.",0
"This product is really great for quick styling and bounce. Love, love, love it! A must for women on the go!",1
Makes a beautiful bun but is not as secure at the bottom of the bun.  It only took me a few tries to figure out how to use it.,1
"There are two major drawbacks to this flat iron. 1) the outside casing gets extremely hot - hot enough to burn your fingers when you clamp it down and 2) it does not have an automatic turn-off. Frankly, I've switched back to my $30 Remington flat iron. This is just not worth the price.",0
"Have not noticed a change seems like expensive liquid ....

Bought @ 40% off and after using it I still feel like I was ripped off",0
"Very nice, not heaby",1
"It is not my first Babyliss but it is very different from my previous one. It looks like a fake or some cheaper version of genuine.  First of all the rotating brush does not work properly, it rotates just for 5-6 seconds and stops then after several attempts starts again making herky-jerky movements that lead to hair pull-out. Second , it is very noisy .",0
This basecoat goes on easily and dries fast.  It protects my nails and keeps the Nails from drying out. Recommend .,1
"I bought this for my mom to try. She never complained, otherwise I might have returned it, but the product is chunky. What comes out of the tube looks like cottage cheese rather than lotion. I assume it works fine, but the consistency is off. That, to me, is an issue. Was old or damaged product being shipped out? I just know if were to purchase the same item from Sephora, it wouldn't look like that. This makes me rethink the reliability of Coola via Amazon or their own site.",0
"I've been using the Clarisonic Mia for the past 5 years and I've had great results; but I'll admit I didn't like purchasing the replacement brushes. So I was interested in the FOREO LUNA 2 for Oily Skin. I ordered it directly from the FOREO website.  The first time I used it, I noticed it didn't clean my face throughly and since the device is hard it does not bend; it is difficult to clean around the eyes. I decided to use it for at least a week, thinking maybe I wasn't using it incorrectly. Well a week has gone by and the results are still the same, it does not clean my face as well as the Clarisonic. I also noticed that I need to use more face cleanser and more face toner. I called the company today to see about getting a refund since it was delivered less than 10 days ago. I spoke with an agent named Alyssa who said she was going to call me back and of course I haven't heard from anyone. They're closed over the weekend so I will have to follow up on Monday. If the company does not cooperate I plan to contact my credit card company.  I purchased a product that does not work .",0

"I am probably one of the pickiest people on earth when it comes to beauty products, but this product is truly impressive!  Most products that I use show minimal results, but the Glyco Extreme peel delivers on the spot.

All you do is apply a generous layer to your skin and leave it on for 10 minutes.  Since my skin has grown accustomed to regular peels, I leave it on for 20 minutes instead.  However, I don't recommend this if you don't perform peels often.  I apply it to my face, neck, and d&eacute;collet&eacute; to ensure even results.  The last thing I want is the ""young face, old body"" look, so I apply it liberally all over.  Then, I rinse it off with a washcloth, follow with an antioxidant-infused serum, and then enjoy the glow! You wouldn't believe how even, smooth and poreless your skin will look after using this peel consistently.  People have complimented me on my skin ever since I started using this product - literally strangers off the street.  Let's just say that never happened before!

A lot of beauty products out there are full of promises, yet don't deliver.  Well, this one goes above and beyond - in fact, I have set up repeat ordering through Natura Bisse's website.  It wasn't until now that I realized I can buy it here on Amazon for a little less.  Hefty price tag, but the results are worth it!",1
"it works only for two months, it does not work",0
"I have used this product before and noticed an AMAZING difference with my hair. HOWEVER I bought the previous Gold Lust Oil from Oribe directly. This product does not seem to do anything near what the other one I had did and the box has a the UPC marked through which I found very weird. It does smell the same, so Im thinking it is an authentic product- but I am really not sure. Amazon is NOT an authorized reseller of ORIBE products, and you are not getting it for a cheaper price on Amazon than by ordering it from the company directly- so I just wouldnt take the risk.",0
Not sure if I just got a bad batch or if this is counterfeit. Doesn't feel like Paul Mitchell product doesn't hold like the gel I bought last time where I get my hair cut... waste of money,0
This package arrived damaged and opened and the item was missing!,0
There is no heat options for this hair dryer. It produces wind that way to hot that you feel your scalp is burning. Not sure if it is defect of the item I received or just the dryer itself. Tried to contact the seller to resolve it but it didn't work out:(,0
I've used this product once before as a supplement to my latisse and it worked well.  This time however it consistently burned my eye so I decided to just pay a little extra and get my prescription latisse.,0
Helps with frizzy hair and smells wonderful.,1
"Use this lotion AM and PM or whenever I get out of the shower.  Love it.  Keeps my skin smooth, helps with my KP and acne also.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it can start to ""ball up"" a little if you rub it too much.  Doesn't happen often but I think it is due to the SPF.  It will also gather around the crease in my skin by my elbow if I'm out running and sweating a lot, but not really a big deal.
All in all, I can't imagine not using this lotion.",1
"I bought this set because I love Babyliss products, but when I plugged it in it started smoking and the plastic hole where the curlers fit into melted to the curler. I returned the item and did not want a replacement, as I was afraid it would burn my hair.",0
Bought this curling iron just 2 months ago. Today it burned off a section of my hair when I started curling. I suspect the unit somehow malfunctioned. Buyers beware!!,0
"All Moroccanoil Products are amazing so it's no surprise that I loved this brush! I have a short bob and this is the perfect size for the majority of my hair. No breakage, easy to get the hair out from the brush, love the orange thing at the bottom for parts and I love that it's so light weight.",1
"Either they changed the formula, or some of the pencils are produced faulty, and some are good, I have no idea why there are good reviews for this pencil at all. My pencil is horrible to say the least. It breaks 100% of the time. I managed not to break it only when it shows 1/10 of millimeter of the colored part, but then it almost doesn't draw at all. And the mechanism of opening  the pencil is terrible - you have to really apply strength to turn it, very weird.
I have it for a month now, I managed to use it once(!) without being frustrated((
I like Lorac company, but this pencil is their huge failure, and a waste of my money.",0
If you don't have one - get one. . . amazing!,1
"To be up front- I have sensitive skin. Strivectin made my skin red and a little irritated for quite a while. After the irritation calmed down, it made me zitty. It continued to make me zitty for the whole 6 months I used it. Most importantly, I saw no difference in my wrinkles at all. I'm 49 with average wrinkles and saw no benefits to this product.",0
"Have tried many tinted moisturizers with not very good results. However, this one seems to do the trick...no breakouts so far (I have sensitive skin) and the overall coverage is great.  I put on some blush, mascara, tinted lip balm and ready for the beach or pool.  Will buy again.",1
Feels great after shaving. Toned skin.,1
"Smells weird, doesn't wash off easily, and comes in the stupidest little container I've ever seen.

One star off for the container it comes in (shipping it in four pounds of glass isn't every environmentally friendly), two stars off for the price  (this is bulk-Chinese-manufactured $0.03/gallon hair product, not sterling f-ing silver), and one star off for kind of generally being bad at what it's supposed to do.",0
"The first thing I notice when I opened the jar was the uplifting scent.
I have incorporated this body cream into my nightly routine.
I use after my shower. The cream works nicely on my sensitive skin and leaves it feeling so smooth.
The scent is not too overpowering and does linger for a while on my skin.
I appreciate the elegant look of the jar that looks so inviting on my bathroom counter.",1
Unfortunately there was nothing special about this product - defibitley not worth the money. I didn't have unrealistic expectations but I did thibk of see results after 30 days.,0
"I am not sure what to say about this item. We are still using it along with the Supersmile toothpaste and accelerator; however, the toothpaste and accelerator do not work, so I cannot say if the pre-rinse makes a difference, because our teeth have remained the same.",0
I have been using this cream for some time now.  It give a good lather but not what I expected.  I guess expecting the same results of the lather from a can compared to this might be expecting more than I should.  Overall it does a good job.  I probably would purchase again.,1
"It was the best dryer that I've ever owned. However, two months later the low speed stopped working, and it shoots out sparks if you put it in low. It works fine as long as it is in high, but I tend to use the low speed more often. Of course, I've tossed the box and now need to find the original paperwork to figure out if I can return it to the manufacturer. Frustrating and disappointing.",0
i love this brand and am always pleased with the products. this was exactly what i was looking for and it works great!,1
"Love the smell, but don't waste your money on this product.  The scrub aspect is pretty much nonexistent and you can buy cheaper lotions.  The container is problematic too--when used in the shower, water from your fingers as you dip into it causes the scrub to become diluted and the excess dries around the lid and gets gunky.",0
"Looks great, slim, great design, but it is not as sharp as the Seki Edge and it doesn't stay sharp for a long time. Now it's in my drawer somewhere.",0
"I give 4s on these, although I'm satisfied with the material and can really do it's purpose,  the gap of each pins/brush heads is a little wide.",1
"This smells so good! I first used it in a fancy hotel in Israel and have loved L'Occitaine Verbena soap ever since. This large 8-oz. bar lasted for over a month of daily showers, so it's worth the cost.",1
"This curling iron is great !  Seems to give a softer curl to my hair and I would say it is definitely worth the investment. Does not squeeze the hair as tightly to the barrel which, after getting used to, actually is safer for my thin hair.
You can set the heat which I like. Also appreciate the red light to show it is turned on. Helps me not forget to unplug the unit.

I am taking off 1 star for:
1. Heavy - this is the heaviest curling iron I have ever owned.
2. Very little room at the tip to hold your iron without burning your hand.

Believe me, those are small critiques. I love this curling iron.",1
"So, this product used to be the BEST men's shaving product on the market... Then they decided to cut corners. The original formula was light, fluffy, adhesive, smoothing, and lasted forever. The new formula, uh, no to everything! The lather is visually clumpy and feels gritty on application. Previously it just melted on your face; now it just feels like gritty stuff that requires more to prevent razor burn and a close shave. I don't blame Amazon, which made the business transaction easy and efficient, including shipping. But the product has failed. If the price had dropped or quantity increased, OK, that's understandable. But at this price, no way. So, another product that used to be fantastic, is now riding the wave of fame, straight down the toilet. Sad, but look for another winner.",0
This is a good product for my hair when it becomes very dry and brittle from hair dryers and coloring.  I use it for a few days and then return to my regular ColorProof products.,1
the color of this product was pumpkin orange sent it back,0
Dull lifeless hair. Very heavy product,0
"I do not like using this iron. The spring's tension is too tight and my hair ALWAYS gets caught in it, pulling out strands if any get close to the clamp. Otherwise it works the way it should. Buy it if you don't mind the pain of having your hair pulled out.",0
Nice and refreshing! Will buy again..,1
works great wife loves it.,1
"Really impressed with how well it goes on and blends in. It applies on the skin like a primer, smooth and silky. It's not oily and doesn't feel like there's residue. It smooths out the skin. I expected to see some color or shading because the cream had a beige tint, but it really looks clear on my skin. In fact, it has the effect of blurring out the uneven color in my skin tone. I love the 50 SPF. This means I can wear it under foundation daily. I use it as a BB cream on days where I'm very casual and don't need to be wear make up. Great product so far. Pricey though.",1
"I really like this product, however the compact itself is too large. I wish each color popped out of the larger carrying case so I could throw which ever I'm using into my purse.

Consistency & Color:  The balm is creamy in texture and the pigments intense in color.  Although some may look really bright in the compact, each color rubs into my cheeks to provide a soft blush (and I am very fair). They last well throughout the day or evening.

Application of:  Because the balms have an oily/lotion-like finish, I like to apply them over my foundation, yet UNDER my powder. I find this layering technique provides a great glow that leaves my cheeks with a china doll-type finish. I do not use this product for my lips, because it is to thin for lips, wears off quickly, and unfortunately the size of the compact doesn't allow you to take a color with you to reapply throughout the day/night.

To Summarize:  I give the product 4 stars because of the size of the compact. This should not be a deterrent! The product is fun with all the topless men, and makes a great gift that will last for a long time.",1
"I bought this product for my wife's birthday in June, 2015.  With gentle use daily, it broke (loud squeeling sound) by February, 2016.  I would expect a hair dryer that costs this much to last at least a year.  Not happy at all.",0
My hairdresser & I agree: this product doesn't feel good in hair. Makes it difficult to comb & style. I won't buy this product again.,0
2 words LOVE IT,1
"I have been using Obagi since long time ago.
Results are very good.",1
"This scent is amazing. I was looking for this after discovering through Birchbox and it is super relaxing and smells so great. My mom found this shower gel irritating/not as moisturizing for her, but I love it.",1
"Great for travel, especially long dry airline travel. These are also useful on road trips to freshen and help you stay alert, with a fine mist of fresh water.",1
Great texturizing spray..,1
"shows like I have put dried mustard in my hair. After a couple of hours, it's gone. Will not try again.",0
not happy with it,0
I got conditioner instead of shampoo! What am I going to do with a gallon of conditioner? Didn't figure it out until I'd opened it. What a bummer.,0
"I like this blush but I am disappointed in the cheap, plastic packaging. The ""metal"" paint is flaming off and getting caked in the blush. I like Jane iredale make up and it agrees with my skin so much, but they continue to downgrade their makeup packaging to cheap and shoddy plastic (such as their compact and eye shadow). I expect a little more for the price.",0
"I have tried many self tanners, this one really works. Buy some surgical rubber gloves to apply it. I even mix it with my favorite lotion ,the more you put on the tanner you become.",1
"Made the right choice after deciding on whether to replace a bottle of another cologne with Burberry Brit Rhythm. I've had other Burberry colognes, which were ""so-so"", but this one is a great fit for my preference of day-to-day business use.",1
My wife and I  have different reactions to this body lotion. She likes it on her forearms and hands but finds it a bit dry on her face. I only apply  it to hands and arms and find it very effective.,1
I should have heeded the other REVIEWS.....the unit will not hold a charge. Very disappointed that BaByliss doesn't address this issue.,0
PLEASED,1
"I struggled with adult acne since I turned 25. I really took a told on my self confidence and my wallet as I was dumping money into any and every product I could find to combat it. When I started using Juice Beauty's cleanser, I knew something was different about it. Most acne cleansers dry your skin out in order to clear up breakouts. And while this is effective, it usually creates a cycle of dry flakey skin turning into over oily skin because your face is over compensating for the natural oils that have been stripped by your cleanser. In turn you end up with clogged pores and breakouts all over again.

But not with this cleanser! This cleanser is non-drying. Its actually fairly hydrating!! Its gentle enough to not strip you of you of the oils you need but strong enough to clear up those pesky breakouts. I have repurchased this item over and over again over the past 2 years and don't plan on switching. If they discontinue this item, I will really be in trouble, haha! I recommend this to any of my friends who are struggling with acne!",1
I ordered 3 bottles of shampoo and received 2 bottles w a bottle of conditioner. I didn't realize it was conditioner till i opened it. I don't use conditioner.,0
No ok with my hair.,0
"Nice hand moisturizer, not watery or too heavy. Just wish the smell was a little lighter.",1
"1) The nozzle on the end moves and spins constantly while blow drying and I want to use the nozzle since I'm blow drying my hair straight. It's very frustrating. 2) If the plug moves even slightly, the whole thing turns off. The plug doesn't stay securely in the wall. Also frustrating to have to keep pushing it back in. (My house is new and I don't have this trouble with other appliances so it's not my outlet.) 3) I blow dry my hair straight with a round brush. This blow dryer does not make my hair any less frizzy than a cheap conair one. 4) The heat does feel softer and less harsh. I wish I could see a difference in my hair though. I've been using this for 2 months so I can't return it, but I wish I could...",0
Caused irritation.  Stopped after 2 tries,0
Vibrant color!,1
"This shampoo/conditioner combo from Jack Black works great: it smells great, smooth and light refreshingly clean with hints of peppermint, and cleans well, lathering less than some but still enough. It does actually leave my hair smooth and pretty tangle free (long hair), and honestly, I would buy it for daily use except for the price: it's a bit pricey for daily use, so for that reason, I will be using it for special occasion only and it gets 4 stars. If the price point goes down a bit in future, this product would be fantastic to use all the time, it's really good stuff. Bonus is the bottle comes with a little piece of plastic that keeps the pump from dispensing in transit (a nice touch on a higher end price product). Here, you're paying for the product, the fact that it works well and the name, and it IS a product I would recommend.",1
"Good price, love the color.  Have used CND shellac for about 4 years.  Love the product.  Big savings doing my own nails.",1
Dont work. Wasted money.,0
Good but only use a little or your hair looks greasy.,1
Pretty color polish however the hairs on the  brush are bent making application of the polish impossible and messy. so I'm unable to apply it until I find another brush at this point. I am not sure if this is just a quality issue or was it previously used and sold that way.,0
"I fully expect a blowdryer that costs this much to last longer than a year especially if it used only once every three days or so, but it has started making terrible noises and blows out very hot.  I am afraid to continue using it and will not replace it with another one of this kind.  When it works, it is terrific, but it won't work for long.",0
I shopped for cologne on Amazon. After reading lots of comments of imitations I decided I'd pay a little more and order from the manufacturer. Fakes are a waste of money they don't last because of the lack of oils and excessive water. I'm not saying this one is authentic or not but its possible as its not uncommon in cologne/perfumes.,0
Very useful,1
I have been using this Awapuhi Wild Ginger Moisturizing Shampoo for over a year and I love it.  I also use the special treatment product in this same line.  These products are normally sold only in salons so I was very happy to find them on Amazon at lower prices.,1
"like the product, good toner. it took a few uses to get used to the smell, but I actually like the smell now",1
Love it,1
This product is just ok for me. I prefer the Simple brand cleansing water at less than half the price of this one. This didn't get my skin as clean and I felt like the fragrance may have irritated my skin a bit. Just ok in my opinion Don't waste your money.,0
Leaves hair dry. Nothing like the lavender one.,0
This bar of soap is amazing! The way it lathers is unbelievable for a bar soap. The smell leaves your bathroom smelling like a spa even after it dries out.  It is the best bar soap I have ever used.  The only problem is the ingredients have taken a toll on my natural stone shower and glass enclosure by leaving it ashy and cloudy even though I clean it after each shower and squeegee the glass.  My solution is I will continue to use the Turbo Wash Cleanser in liquid form and take the bar on the road since I do a fair amount of traveling and coming back to the hotel room to a hot shower with this bar after a long day will give me a second wind.  Try this bar.  It's worth the price.,1
"Leaves me even shinier than before applying. The smell is nice, though.",0
"Unless you are a professional hair stylist, or, are experienced at using clipless curling irons, I would veer away from the Bombshell.  It is the best clipless curling iron out there; but, it lends itself to user error because it requires extreme finesse.  It gets much hotter than a normal curling iron and the provided glove is not much protection.

I had to have the Bombshell after a hair stylist used it on my hair for my wedding.  It creates amazing results; but, it can be very, very dangerous for a novice or anyone not respecting the heat this curling iron packs.  One wrong move, and, you could end up like me, with a long diagonal scar across the front of your neck.

This clipless iron can be tricky to use, especially close to the nape of the neck, because it is held differently than a regular curling iron.  Please be careful never to touch the rod to try to catch the very ends of the curls, even when wearing the glove.  Clipless curling irons tend to take a bit longer to slightly wiggle out of your hair when trying to get tightly wrapped curls.  So, if you involuntarily jerk away because a finger gets too hot when holding down the end of a curl, just remember, that extra split second the rod is stuck in your hair matters.",0
it makes your face  sticky and gummy.  Will not buy again,0
"The product arrived in an envelope with a good deal of water in it.
It appeared the product has melted in transportation.
The product had to be Washed in soap and water before being used.
 After cleaning up the product was usable.
I won't buy another one of these.",0
Great price!,1
as pictured,1
It's really moisturizing. I ware it overnight and my lips feel smooth the next morning. I don't like the ginger smell although I know a lot people love it.,1
"If you already have a dry scalp do not use this shampoo. It made it so much worse and patchy all over my scalp. It smells nice, but that's about all it does.",0
"I got this for my wife to try out, and she said it is an excellent foundation. Easy to use, covers well, and lasts long. It covers up blemishes and light discoloration. The only issue is that getting a skin color match; the coloring is strong, so you have to make sure it will match your tone.",1
"I love this scent of this perfume. However I do not recommend this product being purchase online. I read the reviews before and others seemed happy with their purchases, so I took the leap. When I spray this it smells like Amor for a few seconds, then it smells like wood burning. Maybe I got a bad one. But I'll have to save my pennies and head to Macy's.",0
"After wash my face, massage about 5minuites with this mask cream.
I can find more cleaned and moistured face after washing. lol.",1
Not good,0
Initial scent is a faint rose/musk that is quickly overwhelmed by a petroleum scent.  Several hours later the petroleum fades down to a barely perceptible dry rose scent.with no musk at all.  Disappointing.,0
"I've been trying various WEN products, and have been happy with most of them. But this one smells terrible, to the point that it gave me a headache. I thought maybe I would get used to it, but after a week I gave up and ordered the pomegranate one. If you're sensitive to smells, I would steer away from this one.",0
I've never been able to put mascara on my lower lashes because it always smeared and I looked like a raccoon. This stuff stays on until you wash it off. Love it.,1
Its too expensive. I found the same item somewhere else for a better price and for more.,0
Don't know yet.  Time will tell.,1
"Love the color love the pigmentation absolutely beautiful and it stays on all day, I don't even wear a primer with it.",1
it works but runs out way too fast for the price.,0
I wish there was a way to rate the product separate from the seller..Great product but *way* too expensive here. Buy it directly from Toppik.,0
"Fast shipping, great product! I have used other brands and this one is far superior to the others that I have tried! Pretty color too.",1
I have thin fine hair and this is the first product I've used that makes my hair feel thicker and keeps my styling in place all day without feeling stiff or sticky.,1
"Works as advertised, but it does take a couple months to see results. Easy to put on. Non greasy. No odor.",1
Smells good love the product.,1
"I purchased both the shampoo & conditioner from my stylist.  It was a splurge purchase since I normally use Pantene or similar quality shampoo.  From what I can tell, it was a waste of money.  My hair looks frizzier or dry after using it and I have to shampoo daily instead of every other day.  If I go two days, my head gets itchy & my hair looks greasy.  I tried using the ""quarter sized"" amount.  I tried using more.  I've tried rinsing very well.  I've tried not rinsing quite as well.  It doesn't seem to matter.  The conditioner doesn't seem to work very well as a detangler.

I can't say whether it has strengthen my hair.  My hair was healthy to begin with.  The best thing I can say about it - it smells like honey.  I think I'll go back to my $5 shampoo & conditioner.",0
"I have fair, combination skin and bought this looking for a non-greasy physical sunblock for the face for my family.  It has to be shaken very well before application, as it will otherwise separate.  Sadly, however, we all burned using this product.  (I've been using sunscreen daily for over 20 years and am well-versed with how to apply sunscreen and the frequency needed for reapplication.)  Despite the fact that it is cosmetically elegant, blending in nicely with almost no smell and very little white sheen, I will not repurchase and cannot recommend as it doesn't do its job to protect skin from burning. I am going back to my long-time favorite Elta MD products.",0
"I have been searching for a light, clean smelling perfume that doesn't have an overpowering scent. Someone at Sephora's recommended a scent from the CLEAN line and recommended SKIN. It smelled good on the sample strip so I purchased it. When I got home I opened the box, removed the perfume and tried a small amount on my wrist. It smelled so bad I couldn't stand it. While I was doing chuores, I keep smelling it. I couldn't take it anymore so I had to wash it off with soap and water. I do not recommend this perfume for people looking for a light, clean smelling perfume. If I were a man, I would NOT like smelling this on a woman. And indeed it is way over priced. I am going to give this perfume to someone who will appreciate it. I know I didn't. I hope this review helps you in your decision on purchasing this item. Thank you!",0
"I have plenty of hair but it is very fine. I thought this product which claims to thicken thin and/or fine hair would make it appear thicker with more volume but it does not do the job. It is great at regular conditioning, however, it leaves my hair flat which was not my goal. It also has a very strong perfume scent which I do not like. I will not purchase again nor do I recommend.",0
"I enjoy candles by Archipelago. The aroma of Dubai is perfect - not sweet or flowery. A unique aroma that does not overpower. My new purchase was involved with a cat incident that was sent crashing to the floor. Cat OK, but candle didn't fare so well. Even with broken glass, I am still using the candle - safely. You will enjoy the fragrance of this candle. I purchased the glass jar candle as recommended by others as the pillars done burn down as well. My pillar candle, when done with it's candle life - wick be gone- I placed remaining candle in a closet.",1
Color too light and thick texture that is not easy to rub on - even more frustrating that I cannot return after spending $30 bucks!,0
Product came two days before Christmas damaged and opened. I had planned to give this as a gift but couldn't due to the condition it came in. Very disappointed.,0
"Great iron, heats up fast and the cord is long.",1
It's fake!!!,0
"I bought the item on November and then I went back to Saudi Arabia and gave to to my sis as a gift. However, my sis just opend it and it does not work so she thought that I broght something artifact so because of that it doesn't work. Thee lights work when press the botton. So it basically only a design but the idea of working is ineffective. Also, she went to a shop in order to fix it, but they told her that we can not fix it unless she has a warranty or something. It is really disappointed that I paid over $400 dollars for something doesn't not work. Finally, i was going to upload a video in order to let you see how the product is not working, however, i have uploaded a  consecutive photos from the video so you can see it and believe what I am talking about. I'm just saying think again before you spend over $400.",0
I didn't like the color of this self tanner at all. It looks like black stain.,0

I'm using bucheron over 10 yers and the one I order from Amazone the quality was very poor. It is more watery,0
I miss the old volumizer.,0
"I bought this based on all the awesome reviews and it's reputation and the great price.  Though I used Wen cleansing conditioners and a couple other Wen products (which I know are genuine), I admit I've never used this treatment before so I can't compare it to the product bought from a different seller.  What I can say is that I find it hard to believe the product I received and used generated great reviews and it doesn't compare to the performance of other Wen products I've used.  My hair, which is only bob length, was a tangled mess after I rinsed it out, not at all Wen-like.  Like other reviewers, I tend to think it's not the real stuff and I wouldn't order it or use it again.",0
Excellent cream for the babies quality and efficiency for your skin with excellent results immediately try it recommended excellent product 100%!!!,1
This item developed a rough texture after one washing.  It cannot be used to apply make-up.,0
really bummed out - barely any color after 3 hours. i left it on overnight in an act of sheer desperation and got *some* color the next day. i showered and went to work then somehow some grease that sat on top of my skin SOAKED THROUGH MY CLOTHES?!?! i regret this purchase :(,0
"This is my First Review in Amazon & i couldn't rate less than 1 STAR, i got this for my Wife since it smelled very nice when my Sister used it (she bought the same one from perfumania, smell was really excellent)...and for some reason AMAZON.COM is not allowing to return the Perfume",0
"After seeing the infomercials on TV saying and showing that this works on all hair types I was surprised at the results I got. Although, my hair felt conditioned and soft after my hair dried with the product, my hair looked awful. It was frizzy and the curls were not defined. I have normal-fine curly hair. When I wash my hair the next day there feels like there's a lot of residue left behind in my hair from the product that one shampoo wash wouldn't get out right away. Weird. Guess its not great for every hair type. I dumped the rest of the bottle.",0
"It doesn't work? I mean, that's my review. It doesn't change anything in my hair, it just smells different.",0
Very heavy. Would be ok for personal use but not for a hairstylist.,0
"For people who knows this product, and know how good it is. It save me  a lot of money buying the irons like this!",1
Exactly what I wanted.  Prompt delivery.  Will use again and recommend.,1
Product works great. But item is way too small for the price.. I know my fault for not checking product amount.,0
"Good product, but for the second time the jar was dented and oil was leaking all over the box. Need to package this product better!",0
"Love it, does the work well, and I love that It last such a long time. The first one i bought was smaller and lasted me 3 years! So i am excited to know that this bottle is much taller and will last me longer because this a great product.",1
I purchased this item because the reviews and bcause it is a paul mitchell straightener but believe me I regret it!!! I wish I would had returned it right away!!! This thing has been burning my hair so bad!!!! DONT PURCHASE THIS CRAPPY ITEM!!!,0
"It is too greasy, make my face so oily.",0
I adore this fragrance. Love the roll on bottle too. Perfect for a purse.,1
"Great iron and a great price...a total hit, no question!",1
I just love the smell of this brand so much. The dry shampoo doesn't add a lot of body/volume as other ones I've used but it's still a pretty decent product.,1
"I purchased this after using a sample for a week. I constantly battle dry hands. I work with the public, which means I wash my hand countless number of times in a day. I also regularly use hand sanitizer, which dries my hands out even more. I love this cream because it stays on my skin even after washing once or twice. My hands look younger and feel moisturized all day. I will never be without this cream again. I always make sure to have a tube in my purse, especially in the colder months. Nothing moisturizes like this cream.

Update:  I now use Yu Be Cream on my face.  It is the perfect night cream for me. I wake up in the morning with incredibly soft skin.  It also seems to help heal the rare pimple I get from time to time.",1
"This is the second Babyliss that I've ordered in a week that I have to ship back because it's a FAKE. The first one I ordered from a seller through Amazon and it was fake, so I decided to buy Amazon Prime because I thought it'd at least be real, but it wasn't! I guess from the reviews here some people have actually been lucky to get the real one and it works great. I just wish I could find it!! Looks like I gotta go buy it at Ulta or some other certified store. I'm just really disappointed.",0
"This will blow the hair off your head! It's a little on the heavy side, but you only have to hold if for a few minutes. I have long, moderately thick hair and it's dry within 2-3 minutes. I highly recommend.",1
"Do not use this if you have thick hair. It'll make your hair feel like it has glue in it (and I've used plenty different kinds before to know I didn't use too much). I assume this is for thin hair. Great brand, bad product.",0
Had to give this one star only to be able to write a review don't buy. I did used it three times started noticeing red mark under eye then bumps. Ended up with rash burn mark,0
If you buy this product be aware of pop up blockers for other products an eye serum and reform skin care that tell you that they will send you free samples for shipping and handling.  Three weeks later they will bill your credit/debit card 89.79 and 87.97 which was not authorized.  Getting my money back was an absolute nightmare!  Fraud!,0
Shampoo is good. The bottle is hard to squeeze. This smaller one is easier so far.,1
Over priced .  Yes it works.  Yes it dries my hair.  NO its not worth the price. NO I do not recommend this product.,0
"Juicy Couture Malibu perfume is described as having passion fruit, sparkling jasmine, and sensual musk.  My perfume preference is either very clean or fruity (but not sweet) smelling.  I normally don't like ""perfumey"" smells or perfumes that contain musk, amber, sandalwood, etc.  As a reference, my favorites are Clinique Happy, different versions of Bobbi Brown (Beach and Bath), and several different Clean brand scents.  I couldn't resist on the Juicy Couture Malibu because of the passion fruit in the description.  It is very fruity (but not sweet) smelling at first.  It then becomes more floral and musk smelling with a little bit of the fruit smell.  The musk isn't enough to turn me off from it like other musky scents do.  I'm in my 40s, and I really like this scent.  The Malibu scent lasts for a decent amount of time (I spray it once in the air to get it on my hair and once on a wrist to rub with the other).  It's gone from my wrists by the end of the day because of washing my hands, but I can still smell it in my hair when it swings.  Personally, I think the bottle looks kind of cheesy.  Well, not the bottle itself, but the plastic heart attached to the lid.",1
"I purchased this and The Body Shop brand.  I really like both, very slick for razors, very nice smelling, but the little menthol tingle you get (just enough to wake you up) is really cool.  If you do nothing else to improve your shaving routine, buy this stuff.  I have the Tweezerman Badger Brush and a nice size bowl.  Lots of fun to go old school.  You'll realize that whoever invented that *&^% from a can didn't really understand what shaving is all about.",1
You don't really need this to use with the product. Skip it and save your money.,0
"I thought this product was supposed to cover rosacea, but it didn't do a very good job for me and the color was too orange on my skin.  I had better coverage using L'Oreal Infallable Total Coverage foundation.",0
"I've used a number of AHAVA products and I don't think they are worth the packaging they're sent in. There really is nothing exceptional about Dead Sea minerals or mud, and its not worth the cost to human lives by buying AHAVA products, since they use Palestinian resources that are illegally appropriated, according to international law, and as recognized by the United Nations.",0
Slightly unnerving that this product comes with a cancer warning. It states on a sticker on the lid  that it has known cancer causing agents known to the state of California (or something like that). its a shame because I love the product and it makes my hair look healthy and shiny but probably not worth the risk :/,0
Made my hair dry.,0
My husband likes it.,1
Sucks! Broke within a few months..purchased since it had one year warranty but no way to replace or contact seller,0
"I've got this Bio Ionic hair dryer as a Christmas gift, because I used a friend's one and I loved! At the first time I used, my hair seemed to be softer and because of its expensive price and for being used at good hair salons, I thought it was an excellent hair dryer. My mistake!

I have pretty strong straight and highlighted hair. I've been highlighting my hair for 10 years and use expensive products on my hair. I have to wash it every day because it's oily on my roots and because of the cold weather up here where I live (NY), I can't get out of home without blowdrying it. My hair is really pretty because I do take a very good care of it and I have a lot of hair, but after having this blow dryer, I had the worst hair of my life. Dry, full of split ends, weak, breaking and falling apart everywhere and it would never grow long because it would break pretty fast. I went crazy because I didn't understand why that was happening! I thought it could be something I was eating, I thought the products that I used in my hair has changed its formula. I was literally going nuts, trying to find a solution for it.

I bought every expensive product in order to reconstruct my hair and it was not working (the brazilian nanokeratin machine used in hair salons - it is a GREAT machine, it would leave my hair super soft for the first two days, but it would start to get dry again - and I didn't know why!). I knew something had to be wrong. One day I finally realized that the problem that was causing sooooo much damage in my hair was this Bio Ionic blowdryer!!! I felt stupid I didn't find that out first.

Why does it make your hair damaged? Because it warms up a lot more than the regular blow dryers. The wind is really weak, but it is a lot hotter than regular hair dryers and that's what fries up your hair!

Hair stylists use in the saloon because it is dries women's hair FASTER. So if you go once a week, once every two weeks or once a month to the hair salon, it seems to be okay.

But TO USE EVERYDAY AT HOME IT'S THE WORST IDEA EVER! You hair WILL FRY, will get super dry, will break, will never grow longer and will get weak!

I have a brazilian one called taiff - I use the weakest warm temperature to blow dry my hair (just a little warm), but the wind is so powerful that it dries my hair pretty fast (not as fast as the bio ionic, honestly), but I want my hair to be healthy!

After 5 months without using the Bio Ionic and using only my brazilian hair dryer everyday... what a difference!!! My hair is growing longer and it's not breaking or super dry anymore. And the nanokeratin treatment is finally working and my hair is almost 100% as healthy as it used to be!

Customers, be smart. Let the hair stylists use it in their hair salon (but not in my hair never again!). At home for everyday use, buy another one for half of the cost! Your hair will be thankful!",0
"I bought the marcel handle thinking it'd lead to more ""professional"" curls. The handle is incredibly difficult to work with, as you can only use one hand to use it, and you can't touch the tip of the iron,. I severely burned my neck and I could only get it to curl the bottom bits of my hair. It was just a pain to try to use on yourself...you really need a spring action kind unless you're curling other peoples' hair. I kept undoing the curl I had just put in when I tried to get the iron out of my hair.",0
"This scent is a very nice balance of floral with fruit undertones.  It is light but smells elegant and expensive.  The bottle is simple but still conveys a rich feel and even the ""Lacoste"" alligator is done in a subtle way.  The only real downside to this fragrance is that it really does not last more than a few hours.  It becomes extremely light by the end of the day so this is not something you can wear and expect to last even half a workday.  Overall this is a great scent but if it lasted longer it would be 5 stars.",1
I love this eyeliner !!,1
"Wife loved this product. It arrived on time, It worked as advertised and she will reorder again in the future.",1
"After researching on the web and celebrity influence ( Damn you Wendy Williams) I decided to purchase this mud mask. I purchased the larger size because the price was just to good to pass for the amount of the product. When I opened the product, the jar was heavy. The mud is a thick pea green color consistency . I applied the product with my fingers and it smoothly went on my face. The instructions state 5 mins however I left it on for 15 mins. When first applied the mask felt very cool on my skin. Then as it dried a slight tingle sensation but no burning or pulling feeling. When it was time to wash off the mask, it was easily washed away with warm water or you can use the sponge which comes with the product(pictured) . After, my face feels clean, smooth and soft. So happy I purchased this! I plan on using this once a week. So after a month I will do another review on the full affects of my sensitive skin but normally my skin breaks out immediately and this time it has not so things are definitely leaning on the positive ",1
"I got this product because of the high reviews and the notes of ""Citrus , Linen, Lavender."" When I received mine I was...well... expecting it to smell like citrus, linen, and lavender. Im not sure if I just got a bad bottle...but it smelled very strongly of fake vanilla and caramel... it made me so sick... I had to wash it out of my hair...",0
"These just really didn't work for me. I have diffuse thinning--not the worst out there, but quite noticeable. Sprinkling the fibers just caused them to kind of bunch up and clump, so it was really obvious there was something unsavory going on on my scalp. If you sweat a little bit or scratch your head, the fibers will really turn into clumps. I'm glad this works for other people, but I don't really want anyone to be able to tell that I'm hiding my thin hair behind some powder.",0
"I love this AHA Botanical Body Soap and it'll be one of my essentials from now on. First off, it smells so good--it's a light, fruity kind of grapefruit scent, subtle enough to be unisex. It lathers nicely and leaves your skin feeling very smooth and clean. You can use this for problem areas or all over. I use this wash with exfoliating shower gloves on my back, chest, shoulders, hips and for exfoliating my legs. It helps with acne in the sense of sloughing off dead skin, but has no antibacterial properties if that's what you need. It also tremendously improves keratosis pilaris, those annoying bumps that usually appear on your upper arms and hips. With the economical size and price, this is a great value. I'm a very happy girl.",1
Nice but pricey.,1
"Superior hold, little goes long way. Delivered much earlier than expected.",1

"This tiny little bottle of sticky sexy powder does work (yes, the bottle is tiny but it goes a long way) and my usually flat hair definitely had more volume.  BUT I think I'm going to stop using it until we are over this crisp and dry New Jersey winter.  It causes so much static that everything I touched created an electric spark.  It took a while for me to figure out why I was so static all of a sudden and through process of elimination I realized that the static was coming from my hair, and was caused by the sexy hair powder.  I'll start using it again in the spring/summer months.",1
"I loooove the shampoo, but this conditioner smells so heavily of peppermint that I want to gag. I never want to smell like foodstuffs, so I try to avoid citrus and berry scented bath products, but I don't like to smell like Christmas candy canes either!",0
"It has a pungent smell to it. I thought i would like it since i love the sexy hair soya want flat hair, but this was bad. It has a smell and leaves my hair sticky and not completely flat.",0
"I got the career life palette on ipsy deal for $25. For the price it's a great deal. I did a day and night look with it and so far I can say eyeshadow goes on smooth and stays. Blends nicely too but you have to use a primer to get these results.

The lip sticks and glosses are ok, a little drying on the lipstick, gloss is pretty good. I am not thrilled with blushes they are not pigmented and when I use them my brush gets into eye color around it.
If you're going to buy this know that it's for home use only. It's a very heavy sturdy palette so I wouldn't even pack in suitcase based on weight alone. For the price I paid it's awesome but if I was considering this for full price I would pick an UD palette or Anastasia which is even more reasonable instead.",1
"The color was awful.  I did not like at all,  It would be nice to be able to get a sample before opening original so it could be returned",0
"Yum.... love Mario B. products, they never disappoint!",1
"I use this for when I wear ponytails because I have a bit of an odd hairline, widow's peak thing happening, and this always works perfect. I actually have highlights but this matches my little eyes the best, way better than any of the blonde shades",1

This has saved my dry winter skin and turned it into soft and lovely instead of rough and scaley. Terrific,1
V. Good,1
I love this product! Very refreshing and just what I need after a hard day at work or travel. I always have a can in my purse. What I absolutely hate is the price. Much too expensive for what you get. By the time this is shipped to me it cost about $11 per can. I can't continue to justify this cost.,1
"Gives me a lot of volume. Took me a while to get the hang of the barrel turning in either direction.
Only complaint i have is I wish there was a high heat.",1
"When discussing Anthelios, the key point to keep in mind is that, without adequately disclosing this fact to consumers, La Roche Posay sells different formulations of the same product in different locations. I just discovered this the hard way. For years, I've purchased Anthelios 60 from Europe and Canada, and sworn by the protection it provides (like many others in the US, it was first recommended to me by my dermatologist after I had a skin cancer scare). I've been a happy user for 20 years -- until now. I just bought Anthelios 60 for the first time from a US retailer, and discovered that the formulation is very different from the Canadian and European products (no dissolved titanium dioxide, which provides a layer of physical protection, in addition to chemical protection against UVA/UVB). In essence, I purchased the same chemical mix I could have gotten from another brand that begins with N  at half the price. When I called  La Roche, they simply said they could not discuss non-US products. Talk about a case study in how to quickly destroy 20 years of brand equity! Bottom line: buyer beware (especially buyers who have been happily using this produce for a long time).",0
I was really hoping to like this cream. I have oily/combo skin and have to be extra careful what I use. I used a tiny amount right after a shower before bedtime and it felt very thick. Seems like it sat on the skin and didn't absorb. I woke up with my face feeling like it was caked in grease. I am going back to my old stuff.,0
"I have blonde highlights & rarely ever straighten/curl my hair. After using this once, it not only took forever to actually make a curl, but in result left a weird brassy residue in my hair that will not come out. My hair dresser didn't even know what to think of it. Also, after one use, my hair now smells TERRIBLE after i take a shower. Needless to say I will be returning this.",0

"I'm in my early 40s and am noticing signs of aging. I used this serum for a few days/nights until I noticed my skin breaking out. While it may be an effective product for others, this serum is too oily for my skin type. I gave the sample to my mother to try out.",1
Nice smell but way too expensive,0
"I ordered this set for the multiple sizes and large amount of rollers. I have owned one with 12 large rollers from Conair for several years and even after the bottom fell off one it still works wonderfully and the curls stay in for days.  Nonetheless, I was looking for more variety and more rollers so I decided to ""upgrade.""  These rollers SUCK!

I tried several times, each time leaving them to heat on High for 25-30 minutes.  They felt hot to the touch and I liked the grooves in the rollers thinking they would keep my hair in place nicely vs. the other velvety rollers which sometimes unravel.  Used the same styling products each time as with my previous rollers. Each time I left in hair for over 30 minutes while I went about getting ready.

1st: the curls look bad from the start
2nd: they last about 5 minutes even with hairspray and then start falling flat
3rd: by the time I arrived at work, one hour later, my hair just looked like a slightly creased mess. This NEVER happenes with the cheaper rollers.

For this amount of money I expected more, especially since my other set cost $20 and has been giving me wonderful curls for over 5 years.

Now I have to find out how to return this and probably suck up the shipping costs. No good.

The only thing I like about this set are the clips.",0
"I really love this clarifying shampoo for my thick hair. I often times get oil around my roots because my hair is very thick and also deal with frizz...this shampoo smooths my hair, takes out product buildup and really brightens my hair and makes it shiny and very smooth. I'm done with the drugstore shampoos, how could anyone go back after using this shampoo? The shipping was very fast and I am very happy with my hair after using this shampoo in conjunction with the Paul Mitchell The Detangler conditioner.",1

"I would love to post a review of this product, however I am unable as the product was completely gone when I received it.",0
I received my order in July 2016 and have been using it ever since.  I can say that the bags under my eyes are significantly less.  Are they totally gone?  No. But then I am 78 years old and people keep telling me they think I am in my 60's.  So that is good.  I am placing another order to continue the compliments!!!,1
"The Zamac tip provides cool relief, soothe lips and boost microcirculation. The lip treatment is enriched with pumpkin seed oil and vitamin E to enrich, hydrate, sooth and plump lips. I was excited to try it but when I opened the cardboard box, the formula was all clumpy and impossible to come out.  The lip treatment also goes on sheer and leaves my lips smooth and soft. The lip treatment also had unappealing taste and scent. Definitely not one of my favorite lip treatments and a completely waste of money.",0
"I've been on a bit of an organic binge lately, so when I stumbled onto this line of products I thought I finally found something perfect for my sensitive yet annoyingly dry/oily skin. Well, I was wrong. First let me say that I tried the cleanser, the serum and this moisturizer...but it was the moisturizer that set my face on fire. Granted, the serum also made my face feel super tight and uncomfortable, but it was when I put this moisturizer on that it felt like the cream was eating my face off. Yes, I'm being dramatic...but yes - my entire face turned bright red and started to burn. At first, I thought it was just the moisturizer doing it's magic...but after a few minutes and after my face kept getting redder and redder, I decided to wash it all off. So my suggestion to anyone with sensitive skin (or who have any degree of rosacea), be super careful with this line of products. I know a lot of people seem to love this stuff...so I must be in the minority, but I'd hate for anyone who also has temperamental/sensitive skin to try this stuff and have their skin try to melt off their face like mine did.",0
"My hair looks instantly nappy when I use this. I sprinkle a tiny amount on clean dry hair, wait a few minutes then tease it. It will look voluminous, but very dull. After a few hours, my hair looks greasy and lifeless as if I haven't showered in at least a week.",0
"This is a rich, smooth, creamy SPF foundation that doesn't leave harsh lines on your face from not blending enough. It really blends in with your complexion. This product is also lovely because it has SPF in it, so you are providing sun protection to your face. A little bit goes a long way with this product, so it should last several months of normal use. An excellent makeup staple to have in your collection; one that not only protects your skin but that looks natural and soft.",1
"My hair on top is very thin due to Meds and age, when I use the product after I do my hair, it makes it look fuller.",1

"I have used this product for a few years now.  I will start with the most important pro:
It does NOT break me out.

I have skin that hates almost everything.  I can't tell you how many sunscreens I went through before finding one that I could wear daily without breaking out.  Now, there are definitely some cons, which I will go through, but because this product does not break me out, I can live with the cons and will continue to repurchase.

Cons: Leaves a slight white cast.  This is slight on me, but I have pretty fair skin.  I combat this by mixing the product with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Physicians-Formula-Super-BB-All-in-1-Beauty-Balm-Cream-1-2-fl-oz-Light-Medium/dp/B00AXRD8BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Physicians Formula Super BB All-in-1 Beauty Balm Cream, 1.2 fl. oz., Light/Medium</a>&nbsp;.
Not enough staying power.  I live in Florida and I run everyday.  If I wear this on it's own, it slides right off my face when I sweat.  Again, combining it with the BB creme ups the staying power and sun protection because the BB creme offers a physical sunblock.  Why don't I just use the BB creme?  I find that mixing the two makes a nicer consistency than the BB creme alone.

This combination has prevented me for getting any further sun damage (as evidenced by the difference in color between my face and my body).

I highly recommend this to anyone that has sensitive, breakout prone skin.  Just be aware that you will likely need to layer something on top to avoid a minimal white cast on your face (hence the 4 star rating).

If you found this review helpful, please click ""Yes"".  Thank you!",1
This didn't go on as dark as I wanted it to... I put over my eyeshadow color and it didn't stand out. It almost blended. It almost seemed like it was dried out. Not very impressed.,0
This product is just ok for me. I prefer the Simple brand cleansing water at less than half the price of this one. This didn't get my skin as clean and I felt like the fragrance may have irritated my skin a bit. Just ok in my opinion Don't waste your money.,0
"Definitely a new formula. The one one was more runny. This one is a little more of a gel, thicker than the orange face scrub by Anthony. This was the main thing I wanted cleared up.

New formula works just as well as the old and is in a completely transparent bottle. Looks like a solid white liquid with streaks of clean shimmery liquid. I find I'm using more and more just because of the gel feeling. I have to shake upside down and squeeze the sides a good amount to get it out. Not too bad, but i love the old stuff :/",1
"This review is for the Mustela Cold Cream

My baby had dry skin and slight rash on the face and this cleared it up within 3 days. I used it twice a day to clear it up and still continue to use it on his face. I love the smell and it absorbs well into the skin. Highly recommend as a face lotion for babies with dry skin. Worked wonders for my little one. He doesn't like when I put it on his face (or any other lotion) but he gets over it pretty quickly. I have also used it on my face when I get some dry patches too.

KEY! Make sure to shake it before you use it. If you don't use it for awhile or when it first arrives some natural separation may occur. Just shake it like a polaroid (^_^) and you are good to go!

Hope my review helps! (feel free to click on ""yes"" if it does! ^_^)",1

"This has a nice, fresh fragrance that is enduring, but not overly aggressive. As others have noted, the bottle looks nice, but has a bit of a cheap feel for this price point. Still, it's the usefulness that matters and this long-lasting fragrance seems quite nice as these things go and a fair value. The scent is citrusy and nice and 2.5 ozs.should go far.",1
"Really dries out your acne, wouldn't recommend using it daily - as it has strong drying effects; better to spot treat, leave on overnight. Great product, glad they brought it back, many complained that it dried out their skin - its just doing its job.",1

"With the ongoing problem of sensitive scalp, I did not notice much of a difference. If anything, there were times that this felt like it was causing more itching. Other times, however, it did feel like it may be helping, but not much... I also noticed, after ordering a few of these, that the ampules arrived slightly less full than other times. For something at this price range, you do not get very much and it does not seem to do enough. The shampoo was a bit better in terms of efficacy.",0

"I'm not a heavy make up user, but I liked this. I wore this for a midday wedding followed by an evening reception and on a hot midwest day, it helped my makeup last.
- Feels goofy to put white powder all over, but it all comes off when you dust it off
- Doesn't leave any whiteness on top of your foundation
- Powdery finish without accenting lines/wrinkles or feeling too dry.

Give it a try - I used this over Bare Minerals foundation, blush and eye concealer. Felt natural and light! I have a lighter tan skin tone with reddish undertones.",1
"I got this kit to help manage my beard which I had never really grown at length. The beard wash and conditioner is fantastic. The beard hairs softened considerably within the first 2 or 3 uses. The girlfriend was very happy. Using the wash also reduce the amount of itching going on with the beard growth.

Only downside to the kit is the brush. It's very stiff and uncomfortable; feels cheaply made. I purchased a full boar bristle brush which is much, much better.",1
This is one of the best highlighters for the price on the market.  It leaves a beautiful gold glow.,1
Wow not sure if I have a bad razor or what.  I have a mekur 34c HD and a 38 c also.  Both shave great the 23c however never gives a good shave regardless of angle or blade used and Ive tried about 10 different types of blades and used this razor around 30 times.  I either get nicked to hell or it leaves stubble.  Ive been wet shaving several years so I feel like its not user error LOL!!  Do yourself a favor and but a 34c HD.,0
Shipped fast. Great product.,1
"What can I say? I didn't believe that a hairdryer could make this much of a difference on my hair, but it does. I usually get the Brazilian blowout done to my hair every two months. Since I have been using this hairdryer, I haven't needed The treatment. My hair is straight, shiny, and healthy. I love this product and would highly recommend it!",1
"I never recived the product. I use it a lot, The product itself is great, this was an Amazon issue. Other than that great product.",0
The color was too light for supposedly dark brown,0
Works but really any better than any other products A fraction of the price,0
"Love this concealer, and one tube has lasted almost three months.  You must turn the bottom until concealer is in the brush, and a little goes a long way.  Well worth the price as compared to cheap drugstore brands- my usual choice.  I was skeptical of the price at first, but just purchased my second tube.  Highly recommend it!",1
I was not impressed.  It doesn't dry quickly so had issues with it appearing under my eyes.  It doesn't look any more special than a much cheaper mascara.,0
"I like that it is healthy for my skin. I use it after Jane Iredale BB cream as a powder and blender.  It's a tad light in summer for my light olive skin. But it's a nice and warm, golden color. I hate pink or ashy tones in makeup. I also love the heavy duty compact. I will buy this again but not soon it's going to last me for a long time!",1
this didn't help with my self tanning stuff. I use Tanceuticles which is the best  but I applied on elbows ankles etc as directed and I still got patches of dark spots....,0
"Honestly this product was expensive and terrible. I bought it because i hate the new applicator on viviscal so i was tryung to find a new product that worked just as good, but Viviscal is way better. This claimed to be light brown and came out like an ash brown gray, if that makes sense. I do not recommend it.",0
"The color is more of a teal green rather than the lighter blue color pictured.
Would not recommend purchasing based on picture alone.",0
"Yay! I just got my Stila Refillable Palette case (6 pan); and I am thrilled with the look of it! It has a HUGE mirror (the entire inside of the lid) PLUS a brush!! Yes, that little detail is what pushed this up to a full 5-star rating. I got the case specifically for travel, and it replaced my attractive UNII case (also bought at Amazon.com) that finally broke a hinge (bummer!!). I think this case, being metal, will outlast the UNII case, but I also appreciate the fact that it holds a brush. Granted, you can use other brushes if you travel with a case of them, but it bugs me to no end that some really fine eyeshadow palettes come with NO brush. So, are we supposed to use our dirty fingertips to apply makeup? Or run out and buy a collection of brushes? At least include ONE brush for us, ok?

Also, it looks like the pans will be easy to pop out. They fit nice and snug in their spaces (magnets for extra grip). You just take a paperclip, bobby pin or some pointed tool to pop the pan out from the underside. With the color pans snug in their position, you will not see any breakage. I lost an expensive eyeshadow pan in my UNII case because it slid around and broke into a million pieces! What a mess!

Only challenge for the case is to find the exact-sized shadows (most likely Stila 0.9 oz pan) to fit the case. In that respect, the UNII palette is more flexible. But with a busted hinge, the whole thing had to be thrown away - even though it looked brand new in all other ways.

Also be forewarned that Stila eyeshadows are *NOT* always the color they appear to be in their photos! Read the description of the color and judge from that. You can not see the tone, sparkle, or even exact color of the Stila eyeshadows in their photos. I just learned that lesson this week.",1
"DDF Glycolic 10% Exfoliating Oil Control Gel is fabulous! This will kill a zit overnight, I swear! Also stops your nose from being so shiny. Makes my skin so smooth and clear, it's a miracle! Just a little dab will work. Keep this stuff in your medicine cabinet, trust me!.....Marcie",1
Quite useless.,0
"I purchased Davines Minu Shampoo and Conditioner.  These products leave my hair feeling healthy, soft, and manageable!",1
Everything was great,1
Will not buy this again; a waste of money,0
I have no idea how this has so many great reviews but its garbage! It snags my hair and takes about 10-15 slow pass throughs to straighten at all. My hands cramp from holding it closed while using it. Do not waste your money.,0
I am returning this product because it doesn't thoroughly clean my face it feels like there's moisturizer after I wash with it tried others that work a lot better but I do like their hair products,0
"Horrible product. Polish chipped in 2-3 days! Definitely not even close to a week for wear. And the color is somewhat dull, not shiny like shellac. Dont waste your money.",0
"This is the only product I have ever used that has truly made a difference in reducing the crepe-y appearance of my neck.  After diligent daily use for 2-3 weeks, some improvement can be seen.  The skin is less saggy and less wrinkled.",1
Eh. Nothing special.,0
"If I could, would not even give it one star. Compare to the price, first it is just a sample size and exactly does what the Walmart samples 99 cents other brands do. Nothing special.",0
"Had an allergic reaction after applying. I used to thoroughly love this concealer, but developed a skin reaction during the second year of use. Seems like skin is extremely irritated over my eyelids when applied and leaves visible markings.",0
"Before buying this, I only used Van Der Hagen luxury shaving soap.  Both do an excellent job. Both make a good lather if I load up the brush and then work the lather for about a minute in a shaving bowl.  Both seem to be equally slick and equally thick.  I will buy this product again (after I've used up the four cakes of Van Der Hagen soap). I prefer the Prorazo soap over the Prorazo cream.  It seams to make a thicker lather.  Both products work very well.  Either gives an equally good shave.",1
"These gloves are thick and soft and nice to wear.  However, the softness is only temporary when you remove the gloves, but doesn't last.  I have very dry hands in winter and hoped these would soothe that but it really has no effect at all.  I previously used heavy hand cream with white gloves and this worked much better.  I will be sending these back.  If you have nice hands already and want to pamper yourself that is all these are good for.",0
Love this,1
"I love it, removes eye make up perfectly, delicate on skin, leaves a fresh sensation",1
This is not what I've come to expect from hot tools! I've owned several hot tools curling irons in the past and this one is far inferior. It doesn't glide smoothly through the hair and instead sticks as you pull your hair through. Also the first and subsequent times I've used it the thumb handle (I guess that's what you call it) bent while using it after it was heated up. Don't know if this is a knock off or just a bad product by an otherwise good company.,0
CLUMPY!!,0
The curling iron was purchased for my wife. She's happy with this iron and has no complaints. It heats  fast and does the job. There are higher priced irons and I'm sure you could get more iron which is the only reason I didn't give it five stars. She's happy and the price was right which makes it a solid purchase at ths price range.,1
Lightweight cream. Unscented.  I like putting it on under foundation and it is not too oily :),1
"Just bought this last week and it did NOTHING.  I read the reviews and made this purchase with confidence but suspect now that the reviews are fake.  I'll give you a real review....don't waste your money.  It looks like a toy, is made cheaply but most important, it did not curl at all.",0
I like it much,1
Made my hair greasy and returned.,0
This product is one of the worst products I have ever used on my hair.  The price was ridiculous.  It made my hair like straw after use.  Talk about a bad hair day!  Yikes!,0
"I got this for my husband as a funny gift for his birthday. Toppik really works, he has a small bald spot on the top of his head and it looks filled in when we use it

~Meme",1
Polish chips very easily  Love the color.,0
I was not satisfied with this product.  I have purchased it in the past and this one was not the foam I expected.  It was watery and I returned it.,0
I usually love hair products from Pureology but this one not so much.  The scent is not good and the product is heavy on your hair and does really work as well as other products do.,0
i love candles and scents but this one was so expensive and you could barely smell it. My friend has the same one and it smells great so maybe I just got a dud.,0
Item description didn't match product title or product features. Item was supposed to be new however product was not in any packaging indicating it was new.,0
This product is terrible and a complete waste of money. Not only does it not work (I've used it for a year) but they also scam you into buying the application gel which is ridiculously overpriced for what it is. Don't waste your money.,0
I had been use to wearing Polo (Regular scent) and Chanel Bleu. My wife fond this and wanted me to try it. She LOVES it on  me. So I now have another cologne that I really really like. Great Price fast shipping!,1
"I bought this scrub as a possible replacement for an herbal scrub that had been discontinued, not having interest in sugar scrubs.  Though the product description makes no mention of it and the ingredients list obfuscates the fact describing it as ""sucrose,"" this is a sugar scrub, almost entirely composed of sugar crystals and glycerin, with only trace amounts of the touted dead sea herbs, and no other exfoliant was noticeable.  Additionally, the scent of the product is a revolting and overpowering artificial grapefruit, rendering it practically unusable unless you're really looking for a morning wake-up call.  If you're actually looking for a sugar scrub, I'm confident there are many options that are as effective, less noxious, and less than half the price.",0
"I am a faithful user of nail envy for more than a few years and it absolutely works - if you get what you think you're paying for. I am using the product I purchased through Amazon the way I always did, and my nails are now so thin (and broken) they actually bend!  I've given up thinking that this might work and will make the trip to a salon and buy the real deal.",0
I usually buy this product from Ulta but decided to buy thru Amazon and i still had some left from my old bottle and I noticed the color was different also when i used the one i bought from amazon it burned the heck out of my eyes and i could not open them they stung so bad my daughter used it too and she said the same thing and the one we buy form Ulta is very gentle and mild and does not burn at all i can even open my eyes. I am not sure if this is a true product would like a refund. I refuse to use!!!,0
I really hope my order doesn't come broken. Praying and hoping because I'm so anxious about it.,0
"Didnt see much difference in my skin while using this. Brought it on recommendation from a friend, and was not totally worth the money.",0
First off arrived smashed on both sides due to them saving postage and shoving in another product I had ordered from them. But otherwise I don't think the brush was that great. I don't know if my hair is too thick or what but it doesn't pick up my hair to pull out while blow drying. It's like it isn't strong enough. Do wish it would have worked tho. Wah,0
after just 3 years the wire came loose in the handle and now blinks on and off. Poor design!!!,0
Light weight.,1
"I tend to become a little concerned when treatments for the eye areas contain warnings to keep the products away from the eyes. Such is the case with the milky eye treatment lotion by Obagi. First off, I don't care for the large plastic dispenser because I can't determine how much of the product remains in the bottle. I also find that obtaining a tiny amount isn't easy, especially when I'm rushing to push down on the pump. The product itself is rather nice, and a tiny amount applied by the ring fingers of both hands to the eyes takes just a few gentle pats. There is no real scent and the lotion quickly dries on the delicate skin surrounding the eyes. There is a pretty quick feel of tightening which lasts for several minutes that almost feels like a drying of the skin, so moisturizer applied to the remainder of the face seeps onto the eye product to counteract that sensation. I only use this lotion for daytime, but you can use it at night, too. I never tried the Obagi line when Dr. Obagi actually owned it, selling his formulas, so I'd like to compare his current line of products with this one that wears his name but is not his product.",1
Applicator sends very small amount of fibers with each press; your wrists can get tired,0
"I love this product! It leaves my skin feeling amazing! I wash my face in the morning and at night so I always need a large bottle of it. And, here I found a large bottle for a great price.",1
Makeup is very thick.,0
"Good but don't know if I will buy again, just ok.",1
The candle arrived with the glass jar broken.  I don't think its safe to handle the hundreds of pieces of glass.  Is returning it the only way to get a refund?,0
Moisturizing effect and lingering scent both are remarkable. This cream has no equal!,1
"This conditioner smells AH-MAZING. Maybe the best smelling hair product I've ever tried.
If my bank account would allow me to use this product for the rest of my life, I'd do it. Unfortunately, I have more of a Suave budget.",1
The bottle I received is old and leaves bubbles under my nail polish.,0
nice and light. i wear it under makeup. i wear it everyday on my face and all summer. very nice product.,1
"I have used this root lifter for years and really liked it but had never bought it online.  I decided to try ordering it as it was cheaper than what i can get it for, at the store, even with a shipping charge.  I didn't want to pay a shipping charge but decided it still was cheaper than buying it here and paying tax.  I am so glad I bought it and the company it came from sent it out right away to me.  I will recommend this to my family and friends who also use this product and I will buy it again.  I bought 6 of them and will do the same next time., and only paid $4.95 for shipping charge.",1
Been using and ordering this for a couple of years.  It is astounding that the mouse version is more usable but not organic.,1
Great stuff,1
Silk color is really light but what is really disappointing to me is the small amount of concealer. The eye cream in a tube is a clever idea but I'd prefer more concealer.,0
I like the smell and the product! Baxter has very good products and this scent is my favorite out of the three.,1
I found this to be a bit drying.,0
"I bought the travel size. It arrived with NO CAP! Without a cap, I can't take this item in my suitcase, so it's useless to me. I've requested a replacement.",0
good,1
"I have used this before, so I knew what I was getting.  However, I didn't look at the size before ordering...it was the smaller tube, not the larger one...I'll pay attention next time.",1
Arrived before scheduled time. Does the job well but should have ordered the light brown.,1
"this product is a piece of shit.
i bought this as a birtday gift for someone and this thing only works on 400 Farenheit anything lower you set it to it doesnt heat up and even at 400 its not that hot i'm really disapointed with this",0
Only lasted four days before it chipped BUT for me that is a record with my thin nails.,1
"This is one of the best things I have purchased on Amazon, possibly since I began shopping online in 2013. Granted, I really like to have my hair curled a certain way, so I am very invested in getting a great hairstyle! But this curling iron does perfect 1 inch curls, which stay in my hair for a long time. I could not wash my hair for a day, and there would still be significant curl the next day. I'm not a girl who gets many comments on my appearance, but since I have started using this straightener people have asked me what I do to get my hair to curl that way! Very flattering.

I might add that I had never been able to master a curling iron before this one. For awhile, I was using trainer curling irons- wands, and the kind with the track that you can wind your hair around. I had a Conair wand, and a Tigi curling iron with the track. Then I started trying to use a Revlon 2 inch curling iron- could not figure out why my hair wouldn't curl the way I wanted. Then I tried a Babyliss 1 1/4 inch, which curled my hair but the curls fell out. Couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong, but I really feel that the hot tools iron created lasting curls that held their shape.",1
I ordered this for a friend and she wasn't satisfied (yes the thirteen year olds can have fun with that sentence).  It doesn't adhere to her nails and peels off too easily.,0
"The medium color would be great for blondes, because it's too light for hair strokes to show up on my skin. It will show up dark if you put layer upon layer on your skin. But I'm a brunette and I would like to use it to make hair strokes in one stroke per hair. Does that make sense? I dunno if it does or not. I just smoked a ginormous spoocher. I like the easy to use applicator. I will be ordering the dark to try out.",1
"If you're doing false individual lashes, this is the tool.  Took me a bit of time to get proper grip and flow going but once I did, easy.",1
"I love the product itself. It's the second time I've bought it. It's quite heavy, and probably not an every-day concealer, but is amazing for those days when your skin is in a bad state. Also good for dark eye circles and hiding sunburns.

The reason it's only 4 stars is that both of these that I've owned, after about 5 days of an easy life sitting on a shelf and being opened once in the morning, then gently placed back on the shelf, the plastic hinges completely crumbled leaving me having to wrap a hair tie around them when traveling. If you want to keep these in a purse, expect them to break very early on and half to be elastic'd closed forever more.",1
"I already take good care of my skin and exfoliate regularly and use good serums/creams, so usually adding a new product doesn't always make a dramatic difference. After using this Obagi for almost two weeks I'd say that there is an improvement in evenness of color and texture in my skin. I've had no adverse reactions, breakouts or irritations from the product and I think it does a good job of adding moisture without being heavy. It's a light cream and takes about two pumps to cover my full face and neck. I very much like the citrus scent of this product versus the flowery scent of many other products in this class. I usually layer with a moisturizer with sunscreen which seems a good combination that is not greasy but well protecting.",1
"This really helping to make my nails stronger !
I like the subtle hint of pink.....that is why I purchased this particular one.",1
"This is nice but not really 20 percent glycolic, ended up getting cheaper from The Ordinary with lower percentage of glycolic and got results from that",0
"The color is natural and beautiful, but the applicator brush is less than ideal. One click never produces any liquid, two clicks sometimes does and sometimes doesn't, and three clicks is suddenly way too much liquid. In addition, it doesn't stay on long. I had to reapply every 3 hours, which sounds like long time, but I'm not a reapplies-her-makeup-several-times-a-day kind of girl. I have $8 lip stain from Krogers that I like better than this. If it was $10 I'd buy it again, but not otherwise.",0
Did not care for at all. Didn't even seem like a dry shampoo. Will not be purchasing this again,0
"Not ""NEW"" but a beautiful color that I'll keep and wear!  Looks like a stunning copper on the nails, with some texture, but with a high gloss top coat added.....makes this Exceptional!!  OPI comes up with the best colors and textures!!
~S~",1
"This is the first time I have owned a product like this and I am glad I waited till this product was available! I noticed the difference right away as to how smooth and healthy my face looks and feels. The only complaint I have is that this product didn't come with any ""how to use"" instructions but did direct you to their website to view the online instructions. The only instructions that were available was for the original mini not the mini 2 which has 8 different settings. I have never used one of these before so I am still trying to figure out the different settings. I do highly recommend this product and plan on buying a second one to just keep in the shower.",1
Jury is still out on this!,0
Love this sun screen...it's so light and  wonderful on sensitive skin. I will defiantly purchase again. Fast service and great price too.,1
Perfect for anyone with naturally olive complexion,1
This brush stand serves its purpose well and does it looking good in black! A real money saver for those that want to spend on the brush but save on the stand!,1
"I love this set! Had to replace it earlier this year because it got knocked off the counter and the plastic top broke. Six months later the same thing happened. I won't be purchasing a third set. For the money, it should be better made.",0
Great filler for those sparser areas on hair!,1
"I like this toner and don't mind the price. Because good skin = worth more than luxury brand MU. My friend actually introduced me to DDF skincare. The Glycolic 10% Toner does pick up any traces of make up that my jojoba or mineral oil missed. And it does leave my skin with that plastic-y smooth look. My pores are left smaller, and tightened.

However, I have a bone to pick with DDF. There are 2 reasons I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 5. I absolutely hate the fact DDF threw in a few cheap fillers. The two that annoy me the most in this formulation are menthol and witch hazel. I get that it's a cost reduction strategy for the company and they probably thought buyers would be duped into finding it beneficial. Some people love that cooling sensation Menthol brings.

But for a rosacea-prone girl like me with sensitive skin, it is a BIG con. These ingredients cause a lot more irritation than necessary. Glycolic Acid in itself irritates my skin. I definitely need it though in order to have smooth texture. And the redness usually does subside within minutes. Menthol and Witch Hazel added in however, leave me with inflamed skin for about an hour. I might not be so irked by this, if it weren't for the fact I *know* both are slowly drying my skin's moisture barrier out over time.

There are better glycolic acid toners on the market in terms of formulation and price. I won't repurchase. I'm sure tons of people are fine with Menthol or Witch Hazel. If you're one of them - feel free to try this.",0
"I love this deodorant.  It really does work for 24 hours.. longer, really.  It is pretty easy to apply once you get the hang of the applicator.  It is still an aluminum-based product, but there seems to be a lot less chemical-based agents aside from that than your typical deodorant.  It is not yet listed on the EWG Skin-Deep database, but when it is, I'll be looking it up ASAP.  If this really is a healthier iteration of a functional deodorant, I will gladly spend the additional cost.

My only hesitations are these:
-- Even though it says it is non-marking, it absolutely is.  Take care to let it dry/soak in before putting on clothes... not too long, but just a minute or two.  And take care with letting dark colors rub over the underarms... the deodorant will show up and need to be cleaned off.
-- The nature of the tube will inevitably cause issues as the tube starts to empty, and create waste.  For this price, I will for sure open up the tube and apply in another way... but I'm not really looking forward to that.  I'd really prefer some sort of push applicator that uses the product efficiently to the end.",1
"I spent a lot of money on this little eye cream only to find out that it is loaded with Parabens!  Why would I pay $50 for a cream that has ingredients banned in most countries and most holistic minded brands avoid?  The fact that Amazon doesn't show ingredients of the product is a shame and I really wish I had googled it before I purchased it.  Please note that it contains:  Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Isobutylparaben.  All potentially cancer causing.",0
I love this shine spray.  Makes my hair feel soft and bouncy.  The spray is not too stiff,1
"I bought this after hearing several rave reviews from others about this product.  I wasn't as blown away as others are by it, but it does smell great and does about as good of a job with root lifting/volume as any other quality volumizing spray I've used.  It's pricier than any drugstore root/volume spray, which would be my main complaint.  I have stick-straight hair, and I am using this product strictly for lift and texture. If I had the kind of gorgeous, wavy hair that looks awesome after a day at the beach, I think this product would be essential. If you have curly or wavy hair, you can spray it in when your hair is wet and let it dry. Gives a great ""beach-y"" texture/feel. Unfortunately, with my kind of straight hair, that isn't the kind of look I can achieve.",1
"Very watery and leaves streaks. I feel it wasn't true to the color (I've had in the past and more shimmery) no shimmer with the polish I had received, very disappointed in the product!",0
"Great product.  I've been using IS Clinical Youth Eye for about a year now, at the recommendation of my dermatologist.  It has greatly reduced the fine lines under my eyes.  I gave the product 4 out of 5 stars due to the high cost of the product; however, Amazon offers competitive pricing on this item.

The IS Clinical Active is also fantastic.  It helps heal adult acne and brighten skin tone.  My skin looks MUCH better since starting both products about a year ago. I'm 51.",1
Too greasy. Can't get it off my hands or out of my hair.,0
does not work as advertised and turns yellow,0
"I have been using Rusk Jele Gloss for years, I have very fine soft hair and cannot do anything with it. I shampoo and apply the jele and let dry,
then I can style with the curling iron. it is the only thing that works for me and I cannot find it at any store so I purchase here online and the service was great. TY",1
"I have very dry, highlighted blonde hair. I love Klorane Olive Oil shampoo and conditioner for aging hair - it leaves my hair silky and full of shine, so I decided to try the Mango Butter for dry hair for a change. The shampoo is very thick, unlike the olive oil shampoo, leading me to believe it was rich in emollients. It smelled lovely as well. Unfortunately, this shampoo, even followed by my regular conditioner and leave-in conditioner, dried my hair out completely (like straw!) The elbow length back of my hair was knotted completely and my highlights were significantly dulled - almost reddish. I had high hopes, but I can't recommend this to anyone with dry, highlighted hair that has fine strands, but a lot of them. Please be careful if you have very light blonde highlights when using. I'm a natural blonde who started getting darker blonde with age, thus the highlights. I have never had a shampoo do this to my highlights and I'm hoping some purple shampoo can restore them. if you have normal hair and a brunette, this might work for you. Again, it's thick and smells good. Very unhappy with performance.",0
I have been using profoundly effective A for almost 10 years and I loved it. I was so sad when I saw that that they had rebranded and not only changed the price of the product but added additional ingredients to it. I decided to try it anyway and have had terrible reactions from it. My skin has changed and I am breaking out everywhere.  I will now be switching to a different brand and I am very disappointed. I hope they bring the old one back.,0
"Wife review: I wanted to give this 5 stars because it's Obagi but I just can't. This product didn't do anything to brighten or make the skin under my eye more refresh/healthy looking. These beauty products are not expected to be ""fountain of youth"" and given that I have dark circles, I didn't have any high expectations. However, I was hoping this product would atleast make minimal impact on the appearance but no effect at all after 2 weeks of use.",0
After receiving Tria and trying to activate it.  Found info that said redheads and blondes can not use it as their hair is not dark enough.  Do not remember any wording of this nature on ordering info.  Tried to contact to talk about this no return email or call from the company.  Sent it back as without activation it will not work.,0
"I am dissapointed with this polish: it is sparkly, which does not show on the pictures.",0
Best zit cream ever.,1

"Never tried this product, but I liked the design, and the fact that it came in a big size. Was really disappointed to find most of the product weight is in the packaging, and the huge tin of pomade was less than half full.  So, now I have a massive tin taking up space on my counter, and not a whole lot more actual pomade than had I bought the average size container sold by everyone else.",0
Doesn't work as a Sebastian product is expected to. I had to reapply the product twice on my hair.,0
"good product, fast delivery",1
"My boyfriend loves the brush, says it's super soft, and the conditioner is a bit tingly (as he has mildly sensitive skin).",1
Not impressed at all.  It seems really dry and cakey to me.  Does not seem to cover like it says it should.,0
It was hard to keep on (it kept sliding off) and I did not see any results. not worth the money,0
beautiful!,1
"After several weeks of using as directed 3 times a week, I have noticed absolutely zero effect. I have normal skin and I was not looking for a miracle, but a nice mask to give me that ""just had a mini-facial"" feel at home.  My skin does not look or feel any different right after application, nor have I seen any changes to my skin after several weeks of use.  As a mask/peel, it does not work for me. I read an interview of Tammy Fender in which she claims to use this as a daily scrub with her Clarasonic brush.  That bothers me greatly, as that is not how she directs her customers to use this product (""yes, I know I said clap your hands, but it works better if you stomp your feet!""); however, I have been using it this way for the past week and I have not seen/felt any difference, either.  As a scrub/exfolient it does not work either.  For $80, I could have had a real spa facial.",0
The hinges keep popping out and then the ceramic piece came out of its housing. The ceramic part is good. Henckels used to have a solid one that had a sheath and that was a amazing product. This is a mess and started falling apart the week I got it.,0

"I use the Mario Badescu line of products and have been very happy with it so far.
I use the foaming facial cleaner (every other day with my clarisonic), then the special cucumber lotion, and at night this drying lotion as well. My face has really cleared up in just the week or two of me using this combo of products. I had realistic expectations, I knew it would be awhile for my face to really show results and I use this in order every day. I think all these together have helped a lot

Before I ordered the larger bottles of these products I tried the free samples MB offers on their website if you sign up and take a small quiz to find out what products would be best for your skin. I recommend anyone interested in trying this brand to do that first before committing. :)",1
Love this it really works,1
"I love opi overall. This came very thick and seemed really old. Have to send back, not sure if the store makes a difference because I've ordered other colors with no problem. Charged up cherry did not work out.",0
"These are definitely on the expensive side but the set is pretty nice. The carry case feels like leather and keeps everything together. The scissors are great. The file is good although I wish the tip had a bit of a curve like most other files that are built into cheaper nail clippers are. The clippers themselves are very sharp and clip your nails really well. So well that they don't go flying every time you clip your nails. That's a huge plus. Some downsides to the clippers are that they don't have a built in file for cleaning your nails (not a huge deal since there is a file included in the set) and sometimes they don't stay in position when trying to clip your nails. Also the clippers don't have the best grip. When squeezing them to clip your nails, sometimes its kind uncomfortable on my index finger.",1
"This is the BEST thing, hands down, I have run across, at this point, for your hair! It's like magic and once you try it, you HAVE to have it! Trick is to only use a very small amount (like a dime in your palm) at a time and rub it on your hair. Your hair is transformed to the softest, shiniest it has EVER been; just like you were at the salon! It is like a secret people have been keeping!",1
Ordered a two pack and only received one head in the box.,0
"The order came in way quicker than the estimated delivery date so I was pleased about that. Now I found out about this product after seeing Jade Marie's (IG: jadeywadey180) post about this product. The first picture is her post and it looks like the most beautiful light pink metallic that had silver reflects. I just had to get it because it was the most beautiful color I've ever seen. When I received the product, I was disappointed. The product was very small (a little smaller than my ring finger) and it looked like it was previously used/opened since there's very little product in the tube that you can almost see the inside of it. The tube's uncomfortable to open and use since the handle is a very short block. I thought the packaging could be better and there should be more product in it since I paid $25.40 (including shipping). I tried to disregard the packaging because I wanted to try out the product and it's not even worth the price. The product is smooth and it isn't sticky, but when you apply it, it's very streaky and splotchy. It's difficult to apply an even coat without it being too heavy on the lips and that's kind of hard to do because you have to apply more than one coat in order for it to be opaque. The product also sits between your lip lines and piles up between them. The picture I attached I had on 5 coats and it was still splotchy. The color wasn't what I was expecting either. I know the color varies depending on your skin tone, but I had the same lip tone as Jade Marie and did not achieve the same color. If you own or seen the Becca highlighter Champagne Pop, you would know that it's a gold and yellowy highlighter. Well that's what the lip creme appeared as. It looked like I just patted on a bunch of Champagne Pop onto my lips. I don't know if I got a faulty product since there wasn't a lot product in it in the first place, but I probably won't be purchasing this again.",0
Im blonde with medium skin tone and black chin hairs that got so bad I had to shave. This product works well if you have patience and are persistent. I have significant reduction in black chin hairs but it seems like some are now coarse white or blonde hairs now which isn't ideal. Overall Im very satisfied but wish i had no hair on chin. I use the device on 3rd level.,1
smells amazing and that is about it,0
Hello! I got this iron because I needed a thicker curling iron. It gets HOT so its great for hard to manage hair. It makes nice bigger sized curls as well. The only drawback is that this iron leaves clamp marks on just about every piece. I am pretty good with hair styling tools and no matter what I did I always had clamp marks from this iron. Wish it didn't because it works well otherwise!,1
John minimum king him ookkkk,0
I have really think hair and drying it can be such a task!  This dryer was exactly what I needed!  Super speed drying!!!  The only downfall is its slightly in the heavy side..,1
I returned it because it seemed like just another thickening conditioner and I don't like the way thickening shampoos and conditioners make my hair feel. I'd rather use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner.,0
I have tried every curler out there and this is the only one that works for me. It's really only good for the outside corner of your upper lashes. But even just doing that still opens up the look of my eye. Pinchy.,1
Definitely helps with drying your nail polish faster. Obviously it doesn't do a miracle where in a second you have completely dry nail polish but at least it speeds the drying time,1
"I must have ordered this accidentally along with the moisturizer. Seeing $10. cost for a small tube, I checked the size and it is 0.68 fl.oz. not the 0.9 as shown. I feel cheated.",1
Very Good,1
"The product works, but the color, while applying, has an ugly green tint. The scent is a bit off too. This goes away when you rub it in. The one I got (same brand/variety) at NM had a wonderful vanilla fragrance. It may be old product, but at least the tanning part works.",0
"Love this stretch mark set. This is my second pregnancy and the first time I have used it. The last pregnancy I was using a lot of body oils, but for some reason this time I haven't wanted to use the oils, instead I wanted a lotion. I love the way this lotion feels and smells. I am not positive if it is necessary to have a separate lotion for the bust area - I'm sure the regular stretch mark cream would work in any area. So next time I may just by the regular cream by itself. So far, I don't have any stretch marks and it's seemed to have help the appearance of some older stretch marks and a scar that I have.",1
Shipped fast but the bottle did not come with a dripper so no way to put on nails so disappointed with this purchase.,0
"NOPE. These are 100% fake products. Do not waste your money on these. I happen to have a Deep Pore brush head from Clarisonic at home, so I decided to compare the store bought one vs the Amazon one. Especially since these brush heads are so expensive! I wasn't surprised to find out that they are fake. I don't know why I thought they would be real.

The bristles are frayed looking on the fake ones, and when you push on the middle blue ring, it super easily pops out. The authentic Clarisonic head does not do that. More proof of the fake product is the lack of logo placement on the actual brush head. In the authentic one, there is ""clarisonic"" stamped on the back of the brush head AND in the little groove part where the Clarisonic body clicks into the brush head. In the fake one, there are no signs of logos.

Super disappointed that Amazon would allow a fake product to be sold.",0
My only complaint is that sometimes the applicator tip takes on a layer of my eyeshadow if I apply it over the top.  Then it doesn't apply smoothly if I don't pump the container.  Almost as if it clogged the tip.  But next day it works better.,1
"Not sure what this did to ""protect"" my hair. The only thing I noticed was the sticky residue. Brushing my fingers through my hair, it felt brittle and dry. I had an extremely hard time styling my short bob to curl in toward my face... The hair kept popping outward awkwardly.",0
"Great color, was a gift for my sister and she loves it!",1
"Was thinking I was purchasing the ""Deluxe"" large bottle with a similar name. Works as advertised.",1
"The last two bottles I have ordered have been defective and do not spray. This is in addition to a bottle I ordered a few months earlier, not working.  Although I like the product, the bottles are defective.",0
"I really enjoy using this sunscreen.  It is light and unobtrusive feeling.  It glides on my skin nicely leaving my skin moisturized. My favorite part is that there is no bad smell to accompany the sunscreen.  It smells like a lotion and not like a sun screen.  The SPF is great, and from the reviews I read I can understand why it is one of the number one sunscreen recommendations.",1
I bought this in February 2014 worked great until this morning plugged it in and it only got warm left it plugged in for 15 minutes and I could still hold my hand on the iron. In 2006 I spent $70 on a flat iron from Sally's Beauty it worked for 8 years. This one lasted for 7 months it worked great for those 7 months....definitely not worth the money!,0
"For a quality product I was shocked when I couldn't open this bottle, it just turned in place never lifting the pump. MEG 21 products are all very good so felt safe using it. The inner part of the bottle lifted out so I was at least able to get some product out and able to use. It goes on easy without feeling greasy or sticky and drys fast. It has no perfumes added but does give off a faint fruit scent thats pleasant. Anti-Aging qualities are not going to show up instantly but my face has a glow it didn't have before, I look alive. Dry dead skin is ugly so having a product like this on your face helps keep your skin moist so it doesn't dry and flake off. I will update this review if I see changes, lasting changes. I hope MEG 21 fixes this poorly designed plastic bottle, use glass with a simple dropper and forget spending so much on different packaging that fails.",1
"I bought this for my kids because they both have out of control curly/wavy hair. My son has VERY thick, fine hair that goes in every direction. My daughter has fine shirley temple hair that tangles and forms dreads easily. This product gives both of them softer, more manageable hair, and cuts down on frizz. My son's hair without product is a giant poof, with this it has nice soft waves and curls. The product has good slip and made detangling easier. Since I bought it for the kids, I really enjoy that it looks and feels natural in their hair. The smell is a little strong (but again, I'm basing this on what I want for kids, not an adult). The price is high, but it is a salon quality product, so that is expected. We are also using this with the 'Spring Loaded' shampoo.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paul-Mitchell-Curls-Spring-Loaded-Detangling-Shampoo-for-Unisex-8-5-Ounce/dp/B00992Q108/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paul Mitchell Curls Spring Loaded Detangling Shampoo for Unisex, 8.5 Ounce</a>",1
"so far so good, I think I like it a lot",1
Paul Mitchel chlorine removing shampoo does the trick. I highly recommend it.,1
The product is not good. No funciona,0
Leaves hair sticky even with a light spray. Nozzle mechanism does not operate smoothly when pressing it. Hair feels heavy with even a little spray and weighs down the hair. The smell is a bit too over whelming.,0
This is a perfect example as to why I don't buy certain things from Amazon. I believe I got a knock-off bottle. This stuff is leaving a ton of residu on my hair and the bottles I get from my barber do not.,0
"Excellent , great smell , sets up beard for a close clean shave . eShave produces the best I have ever experienced.",1
"I just used it 10 minutes, it appeared 3 blink lights (Error lights). Tria's replied me that it had to return, so I requested refund from Amazon. Also, I appreciate to Amazon's refund service.",0
Smells good.,1
"This product contains methylisothiazolinone (which is abbreviated MI), one of the most allergenic compounds used in personal products. MI is routinely included in dermatologists' skin patch tests for allergy, because allergies to it are so common. So how can this manufacturer claim its product is 'hypoallergenic'? That's simply FALSE and MISLEADING. Also, the methylisothiasolinone ingredient was OMITTED from the list of ingredients shown on the website, which is the only reason I ordered it in the first place.",0
Made my face super red and highly allergic to it,0
"Love the feel of this lotion, not too crazy about the scent though. The lotion is great for dry skin and doesn't leave a greasy residue",1
"I love the comb works exactly the way it said, made detangling much easier.",0
it was expired when I received it,0
I was expecting a better smell. Just smells like sugar water to me. It actually smells like another perfume called Delicious Cotton Candy by Gale Hayman that I ordered from Amazon. I'm not kidding when I say they smell exactly alike and I hate the smell of both of them. Maybe it's just too sweet for me I'm not sure but it's not for me.,0
it is ok,1
I have Betty lou Andy Mary lou and I'm telling you this is absolutely FAKE the box is cheap made and light while the original are heavy and better quality. The hilighter itself chunky as hell I rubbed my finger for 5 sec on Betty and Mary and nothing happened now I did the same on Cindy omg it was a disaster do not waste your money,0
"This product seemed a bit off. Will not buy again.
Not sure if it is the real deal so I am going to stick to salons when buying this item again.
It drained very quickly when sitting on the bathroom counter/leaked a bit.
Smelled differently from ones I have bought in the past from actual retailers.",0
it creases almost instantly,0
"Let me just be straight - this is one of the worst cleaners I have ever used!
First of all: It does not clean well. It took me some 10-15 pumps to get all the dirt from my medium foundation brush. I just kept spraying and spraying woth no effect.
Second (and probably the worst part): It is incredibly oily and it made my kabuki brush course and matted. It was so bad that I had to wash it afterwards because it was simply unusable.
I so wanted to like this product - with  all the good reviews and the low price point - but was just very disappointed!",0
Stopped heating up after a 8 months.,0
"I received a large size sample of this product from Birchbox which I'll never use up as I absolutely hated this product. It has great distribution via the aerosol can it comes in but has a very strong fragrance that does not fade. Even after letting the product dry for 5 minutes instead of the recommended 2 before brushing out my hair I found it very clumpy and sticky. In the areas where I was able to get a thorough brushing done my hair looks like some sort of stiff, grey powdered nest. I would not recommend this to anyone, it creates more of a mess than any time it saves from washing and styling.",0
"I liked the idea of this wand so bought it, however returned it because I found that the shaft is not great for hair on the medium to fine side,  I think the upgraded version of this wand with the coated wand is probably worth twice money they are asking.  If you have corse hair that can take a lot of heat then it is probably OK for you.  It works like they say it does.  The waves didn't last as long however, I found myself doing touch ups mid day.  I guess it just depends on your hair structure.",0
"Made the mistake of choosing color on line. What I selected was far too bright and red for my completion.  (Dark blonde, green eyes, slightly ruddy complection) Should have tried colors in a store first. The product certainly does have the staying power.....nearly impossible to remove!  Will try a much lighter shade, next time",0
"great product, great price",1
"I've had laser done in the past and while I'm a natural redhead, the laser worked. This machine hasn't done a thing, a few months in.",0
Gives a beautiful shimmer to cheekbones,1
Heats well. Curls nicely. Brushes do not burn hands. It will get a lot of use!,1
I did not like the smell of this product!!,1
"It is an OK toothpaste, but the taste is too strong and flavory. Didn't find worth the price. May buy again if half the price, but not as it is.",0
This is such a great find!  Smells great and I've had nothing but wonderful results.  I have dry/ combo skin and this perfectly quenches but doesn't feel too heavy or cause breakouts.  At all.,1
Great balance in hand. Excellent quality! Provides close cut constantly. Requires a little practice. Looks as if it will last forever.,1
ok,1
"It didn't work for me.
Abrasive. I won't buy once again. I irritated my skin. Since my dermatologist talked highly about it, i had some expectations, but I tried it several times and it didn't work. A wasre of money.",0
Love it my favorite shampoo and conditioner.  Arrived on time and in great condition. Highly recommend seller and product.  Thanks,1
Love it!!!,1
"This lotion is amazing.  Since it's oil free, it has REALLY made a big difference in my skin.  I actually use it in combination with the Juice Beauty oil free moisturizer (without SPF) because it makes it easier to apply/spread.",1
"This is a very nice product for long or mid length curly hair that wants to be straight. It makes the hair shiny and it has a very safe teflon coat everywhere which makes for easy use. However, I have short hair that is long on top that needs volume. This product is not for volume. Hence 4 stars.",1
"While I didn't buy this through Amazon, I will tell you that Amazon.com is where I always come to look at reviews, and do comparison shopping.  So when considering this purchase, I came directly here to look at pricing and reviews.  I am so glad I did.  I love this perfume.  It is soft, fresh and clean.  I love perfume and candles, anything that brings about a memory or ambiance.  This just reminds me of a trip I took to the islands.  It smells really great on me and my husband loves it.  It isn't cloying, something I avoid in scents.  It is one of my spring/summer scents.  It lasts pretty long on me and I like the fact that after a few hours, it doesn't turn into something sweet and annoying as some perfumes do on me.  If you enjoy light, fresh, airy and clean scents Eternity Aqua is for you.",1
It does not fir the dryer it was MEANT to go with!! I had to duct tape it to my dryer in order to able to use it.,0
I have used this product for several months and have yet to see any results.  The light unit only lasts for a short time and then you have to buy a new one for $45.00.  I would not recommend it to anyone.,0
This is one of my favorite scents,1
about six months use and a tooth fell out.  Expected better quality for the price.  Hopefully the Tooth Fairy will put some money under my pillow towards a new comb.,0
"If I could give this zero stars, I would.  The tip refracted into the tube after the first couple uses and I had to throw out. I've used linear for years and never had this problem. I can't believe this is a best seller.  Probably a paid placement by Stila.",0
Didn't make much difference,0
"I really wanted to like this, but it irritated my skin. I'll try other moisturizers from Mario Badescu but this one just didn't work with my skin.",0
"Goes well with makeup.  I found that if I apply the right amount and rub it in, I do not have a problem with the white residue some people mention.",1
Really bad it doesnt go on well it doesnt look black enough and it takes too many applications to get it to look black and lionlike you have Amy mascara in. Not recommend.,0
Works very well.,1
Have never used this brand before but saw an instant difference in my hair!  Softer and silkier.  I will purchase again!,1
"This shaving cream is simply the best! Yes, it leaves your face extremely smooth. The best part is how it hydrates your skin after a few uses. And the scent is just as smooth.",1
Very disappointed in the products....one cannot be certain that the color displayed is the one needed.  I think something should be done with giving these products a proper name for the color coverage.  I do not plan to use these products!,0
"The Rosa looked nothing like the image. Instead of being a light pink (more realistic) it looks more like the Bellissima which appears to be a much more stark white/ tinted pink. This was absolutely hideous on my light skinned face. Also because it was so white, you could see every crack in my lips so it didn't look smooth at all.

My husband and my friends all either laughed or cringed when I showed them what this looked like on my lips.

Unfortunately, this can't be returned and I don't know anyone who would wear it, so I can't even give it away.

I generally wear the Patina at work and the Aria when dressing up more. I love those, and I love the quality of this brand, but this color is REALLY bad. Now I'm scared to branch out to other colors.",0
"Although this eyeshadow (Baroque) is a coppery brown color with a hint of iridescence, it is natural looking and glide on so easily and blends perfectly. The natural, neutral look is currently the height of fashion, so this shade is spot on fashion-wise. I only wear neutral eyeshadow because I am not of an age when bold colors work. I found that it lasted on my lids from morning until I removed my makeup at night. It is a wonderful product, easy to apply and a pleasure to wear.",1
I love this shaving soap. Definitely a big upgrade from col. conk stuff lol. It smells good and you only need a little bit to get a good lather.,1
This stuff is excellent. and smells decent too!,1
"I purchased this 1"" hot air brush based on other reviews and I can agree with some of the reviews and some not so much. I have short chin length hair and this is what I have found...

Pros:
lightweight
easy to use comfortable soft handle
not overly loud
doesn't get too hot

Cons:
stiff teeth on barrel don't grab the hair enough you have to guide it with your hand
feels like it won't last long
might tangle longer hair
doesn't automatically rotate (would be helpful)",1
"The first two days I could see a difference but then my teeth started to get darker instead of whitening it. Not buying this again. It kind of worked for my mom though, it probably works for people with very yellow teeth. It tastes so weird and it leaves your tongue feeling slightly strange, like numb or something.",0
"The best skin care that I've used!  I am in my mid-40's and have acne and fine lines.  This keeps my face from breaking out because it smooths out your skin and doesn't allow build up of skin and oil.  It has firmed up my skin in only a few days, especially in the eye area.  I'm sold on this product!",1
This product is not Surface. Not sure what it is but its watery and smells horrible. Do not buy this from Glow Distributor - its a scam and they won't refund me my money,0
"Product totally ruined my mom's hair, never ever buy this product again.",0
very nice - wish it was a little thicker- it seems to dissapear fatser than I want it to,1
"It didn't make my teeth any whiter.  I am not a smoker or a coffee drinker, so I thought it would work well, but it didn't.",0
"First, the good: as other reviewers have stated, this beard oil smells great.

The bad: despite really wanting to like this, the beard oil is entirely too thick to serve it's purpose. It's almost like a thick syrup. Doesn't distribute well through a beard and leaves it feeling gross, despite smelling great. You can get much better quality beard oils for this price.",0
"Boucheron is a nice smell, best for older gentlemen though. I am in my twenties so I prefer something like polo blue",1
"The Foreo 2 Luna is wonderful. I originally purchased this little device as a casual gift for my boyfriend. However, he wasn't very interested in it. So I opened the package and used it myself. It's not any different from the Foreo Luna 2 in pink, same thing. So don't overthink the whole ""mens"" thing in the title if you want this device in the color, ""black"". The brushes as not as thick as I thought they'd be. The device is a little awkward to hold. The size is a little big, and wide. The Foreo works well for cleansing. I feel like my face is cleaner after I wash it with this little device than without it. One of my complaints is I wish this machine could clean around the nose better. I feel like I miss the nose area easily, and thats one of the crucial areas that requires extra cleaning. I think I probably prefer my Clarisonic to the Foreo Luna 2. However, the Foreo will be nice to use when I travel. I also love that the bristles don't require replacing.",1
Like the product. Went on easily,1
"All you need is 2 pea sized balls of cream for your whole face and it does leave a soothing cool feeling.
The downside is it leaves a strong barbershop scent on you.  The smell is really strong and hard to take off.",0
"i used it few times and then its stopped working, didn't like it at all.
i regret buying it.",0
"I really like this powder, it is very light feeling and the smell is not over powering. It does smell a little powdery, but I guess it would because its powder. I use it every day. The box is paperboard but is very sturdy, so it wasn't crushed or anything when it arrived. My only complaint is the powder is kind of hard to shake out of the box. But I like it. I might order it again, not sure yet.",1
Love the product..,1
"Let me start by saying I am a adult woman with acne prone skin, that is sensitive. I was told that I would benefit from an antimicrobial brush and to look into something that would gently exfoliate my skin, while deep cleaning. I was super impressed with the pitch, and images.

I don't know if I was expecting magic after the rep talked to my about this product but it's alright. I feel like it is a little rough, but I do like that it beeps when you need to do a different area of the face. The charger is cool too.

I personally think my skin feels better when I don't use it, so I will use it on my body instead or give it a longer go- face wise",1
Very nice,1
Beautiful case also!,1
"Definitely only for those who like the ""wet"" look. My hair was untouchable. It was like I had just gotten out of the shower and used 100 layers of hair spray.",0
Thanks a lot for ruining my marriage Toppik!,0
"I didn't like this at all!  TOO EXPENSIVE. I don't mind paying more if it gets me quality but I see no difference from this oil and any other basic cuticle oil.
Also, it has a weird strong smell. I could smell it each time my hand came close to my face. The bottle is quite small so I'll keep it, dump the stuff out and pour some other oil in. Good size bottle for travel.  That's about all. Call me disappointed.",0
"This is, of course, not a sunscreen but a tanning gel, with just a minimum of UVA/UVB protection, and ""vitamins A through E"". You definitely want to have a base tan before using this product.

It's easy to apply. Just spray on and rub it in. It feels a little oily when you first put it on, but it is absorbed quickly. I like using it on my arms and legs, but I prefer stronger protection for my face. I've had no unpleasant skin reactions from using this product. The fragrance is nice, and not too overwhelming. If you put your skin right up to your nose, you can almost smell something like bug repellent, but when you're not up that close the smell is pleasant.",1
Don't like it because my skin feels sticky after using it as a toner. I don't know if I can get used to that and why in the world is it doing it anyway?!,0
"I have used this product for about a year now, and this is my first time purchasing it online. I am almost positive this isn't the real shampoo I use. The consistency feels so different. This shampo is really watery and it doesn't leave my hair soft as it usually does. The scent doesn't even last. It usually lasts for days and as soon as my hair dried it doesn't smell like anything. I know this shampoo and this isn't it. I don't think this shampoo is legit. At least not the one you guys sent me.",0
"The salt in Ahava products comes from the Dead Sea in Israel. When I was sitting on the Dead Sea (you can't sink, because the weight of the salt makes you pop up) I noticed an incredible difference in the silky feeling of my skin. I've been using this product for many years, and the purifying, soothing effect of the Dead Sea salt is incredible.

FYI - when I was there, I spoke with other people who were also in the water with me. Most of them were there due to having severe and horrible skin conditions, so their doctors prescribed them to go there to heal. They all had the most dramatic improvements from skin diseases that nothing in the USA or their European countries could cure. But The salt in the Dead Sea did! it was amazing to see!

If you're going to buy this product, get the largest size possible, rather than a smaller size.

1. The larger size will obviously last longer.
2. The smaller size is very expensive for the price, so it's really worth it to get the bigger size.

I think they should make gallons of it! This is the Best sea salt on earth for skin. It doesn't dry your skin out, it smoothes it, purifies it, and makes it feel like silk - on top of having a very relaxing bath!",1
Smells amazing and doesn't cause break outs like most face sunscreens do for me.,1
My barber turned me in to this product and I love it.  Great hold and control.,1
I would probably not going to buy it again because it made my skin dry and flaky! Nothing can substitute hair washing !,1
"I'm an adult with no babies. However, I have sensitive skin and like these wipes to freshen up my armpits and neck on a hot day.",1
Broke my skin out. I have combination/sensitive skin. So not a fan. Has a strong fragrance to it which is a nice scent but there is a lot of it.,0
No difference noted. glad i did not spend the money on the big one.,0
Great hairdryer--lots of push with the air and good heat level.  I love it!,1
Favorite night cream,1
"dissapointed, tube amount not worth the price, mask product not up to Elemis normal product standards. Would not purchase again",0
Product did not work from start (won't turn on even after charging) and the return/replacement process has been a huge pain.,0
"This is a very well made, robust scrubber marketed for men. The charger it comes with is very convenient to use. After using it with the sample it came with, the skin feels tight and clean. Because it does well what it was made for, it removes layers of dead skin cells, and oils covering the skin. It is highly recommended to use  a moisturizer after each use. Although I like this product a lot, I must admit that I did not give it 5 stars, because its exorbitant price is not justifiable. I do not know how well this product sells, but I would imagine the price would be a deterrent for many people. After everything is said and done, it is just an electric brush...",1
I have a defective problem in the bottle because the perfume is leaking every time it is sprayed. Not happy.,0
The best stuff on earth...,1
"I was looking for a hairdryer that would blowdry my hair in as little time as possible, and which was powerful and hot enough. This does a great job! I've had it for over 2 years and the heat is still as strong as before. Plus, it's very lightweight compared to the other high-end dryers I've bought. The only thing that would make this even better is a retractable cord but I like this a lot!",1
"Excellent product that I have used for over 30 years, hides scars and blemishes and easy to appy",1
"So I got this product over a year ago, and it never really did it for me. I've got exceptionally fair skin (I have to get special makeup because it doesn't come in my complexion at drugstores), and dark hair. And yes, I used it according to the directions when I first started using it. I've since discontinued it, until I go and get some professional laser treatment. Honestly, I just don't think this product was made for someone to use first. It seems better suited for after you've already gotten some laser hair removal, and only use this for touch ups. It does not stipulate that as a condition for this product, however.

PROS:
-Easy to handle and hold; very sleek design.
-Charged pretty quickly once charged up, I was able to usually use it several times before needing to re-charge it (due to the fact that I was blasting small areas, not huge ones).
-Small and portable. If it actually worked, it would be a great size.

CONS:
-Used for months and months, and I didn't really see any results. Some lightening of the hair, but nothing significant.
-When I purchased this product over a year ago, it was over 4 stars. Now that it's down to 3, you should really take heed it that.
-Pretty loud zapping noise. Kind of made me feel weird using it, because it sort of sounded like a sex toy (LOL).

THE VERDICT:
I would never have purchased this product if it had 3 stars. When I was first looking into laser hair removal products, this one was one had one of the highest ratings. Something should at least have 4 stars, in order for me to even consider it. I'm not going to shell out hundreds of dollars on a so-so-product that doesn't really achieve the desired results. That's one of the reasons the majority of my product reviews are 4 or 5 stars--I onlt get products I think that I would enjoy. So I would recommend anyone looking at this product, to take heed with the 3 star rating. In less than a year, it's gone down one entire star. Perhaps if you're getting this as a touch-up tool it would be okay, but I really wouldn't spend the money to find out if that was its intended purpose.",0
SELLER MUSTN'T BE IN AMAZON. I ORDERED THIS PERFUMES A FRIEND IN USA. HE GET ME TO TURKEY. I PREFER THIS BECAUSE IT WAS CHEAPER THAN TURKEY.AFTER I OPEN THE BOXES. I UNDERSTAND IT IS TOTALLY FAKE.BECAUSE ITS FLY IN MINUTES.,0
It broke already!  I am so disappointed.,0
Definitely a good value ! Very satisfied with how my hair feels after using !,1
"I used this product for years and it was great.  Covered thinning areas, stayed on in wind, after the gym, while I slept.  The only way it came off was in the shower after shampooing.  I was a big fan and invested a lot of money in this product over the years and was happy to have it. Unfortunately, the last few containers I purchased turned out to be not only a total waste of money, but an embarrassment.  I started noticing bare spots in my scalp by the end of the workday.  It looked worse than if I did nothing at all.  The last time I tried it, I could see it actually falling out of my hair onto the tile floor in the work bathroom.  I could have written my name in the mess it made.  How embarrassing that would have been had I been in a meeting.  Not only that, I am noticed my scalp was getting itchy, and I could see the black fibers in my tissues when I blew my nose!  So, not only was I walking around with a blotchy scalp I was breathing this stuff in as It was, obviously, raining out of my scalp during the day.  I am never spending my money on this again.  Total waste of money and cannot possibly be healthy for your lungs.",0
I have sensitive oily skin (a T-Zone nightmare) and this product works great.  I use it everyday and it does not irritate my skin (or cause breakouts).,1
"I like StriVectin products, in general, and use their SD Advanced eye cream and moisturizer.  Because I've had such great results with those products, I decided to try the Retinol product line.  Unfortunately, this night cream made my face break out with large cystic type acne from just one night's use.  I'm still struggling to get my face calmed back down.  I will continue to use the non-Retinol products.",0
"Won't use anything else now. I went to a salon who had just changed all of their polish to vinlux. I fell in love with it there and actually bought my color and this top coat off of them. Since then I have bought every color possible. If done correctly this polish will last forever. It stays and looks like a gel polish. If I do use a different brand of polish I still ALWAYS use this top coat. It's thick and smooth. Only problem with all of their polishes is that when you get towards the bottom the polish kinda gets gooey. But I still buy it. That says something.
UPDATE
I still love this polish. It works very well. But as I said before.... it gets kinda gooey towards the bottom. I've bought several of these bottles now and I've noticed that I'm only able to use half to 3/4 of the bottle due to the consistency. I'm not storing it wrong or differently than any other polish I have or have had. I've tried several ways to soften it back up to be able to use it but I can't seem to find a possible solution. I've demoted it to 4 stars.",1
Chips easily. Does not last.,0
Everything is good except the cleansing water it wasn't closed well the all bottle spill in the box,1
It turned me orange and streaked me. It took me a week to scrub it back off my skin.,0
"I've never tried a ""premium"" shaving cream and got this on a lightening deal.  Overall I'm not that impressed.  If you want it to work effectively you need A LOT, way more than you'd use for the standard foaming cream.  I also don't notice any improvement in how my skin feels, I'd say it feels about the same as when I use the foam.  Basically what I'm saying is it costs more, and for me, doesn't add any benefit over a can of 99 cent barbasol.",0
This product has a weird chemical smell that you can smell on yourself all day.  Wouldn't purchase again.,0
"Strange, large glitter particles in this... not a good look for a mattifying primer.",0
"This product is great according to my wife. I will admit that I have tried it does a nice job on my skin. If you have very sensitive skin, I would imagine that the active clay would not be for you. Otherwise it does a nice job of deep ""cleansing"" and it feels really good during and after applying.",1
"Perfect size for traveling.  It doesn't get super hot, but it does the job on my bangs.",1
To grease and had a burn sensacin,0
"I'm of two minds about this product- I really like the matte (peach) but I'm less enthusiastic about the dewy (pink) side.

The matte side I have been using on the areas next to my nose, where I have large pores and roseacea. It blurs the pores nicely, but barely has enough tint to deal with some of the roseacea. It goes on smooth and silky, and almost instantly feels dry. I like that, having very oily skin in that area. It doesn't last all day, but it has a nice compact and is easy enough to deal with in the middle of the day. I've used it on clean skin and also over oil free sunscreen; it doesn't seem to matter. It works fine either way. I have not tried it over makeup yet but I think it should work fine, because the foundation I use is also oil free (silicon base like the sunscreen).

The dewy side I've used on my cheekbones and above my eyes and I have to be really careful not to use too much, because it stays a little sticky if I use even a hair too much, and that drives me batty. Used very sparingly, though, it creates a nice, fresh, look.

Neither side has made me break out, and I break out if I put anything remotely oily on my skin.

I think this is a really nice product if you have break through in oily areas of your skin, because it's easy to carry and super easy to apply.",1
"this product is very good for fine thin hair, the only draw back is the price.",1
"The worst stuff I've ever put on my hands! It smells awful and I had to wash it off. It sits on top of your skin like wax. Ingredients are misleading. Don't be fooled by the cute packaging, it doesn't reflect the poor quality of the balm. There are far better products out there!",0
My lashes hav not grown like they did with my first bottle.  Maybe I got a knock off? :(,0
"I love this polish, although it is a little hard to remove (all polish like this are regardless of brand).  It is beautiful on and only need a couple of coatings.",1
In love with this foundation. After using MAC liquid foundation for years I was very hesistant to try something new and I really wish I would have sooner! My MAC used to look cakey..the application of this foundation is so smooth and looks great and gives you a nice glow. I'm very happy!,1
"The FHI straightener is fantastic as far as initial use but ONLY BUY FROM A SALON! I am on my third one. My first broke after a few years which is to be expected. I loved it so much I bought another FHI. It broke within 3-4 months. Luckily I bought it from a salon and FHI was able to replace it for me but the replacement process took almost 2 months. I bought another high quality tourmaline straightener @ a $135 price point. I did not like it as much as I liked the FHI BUT if you buy this product ALWAYS buy from a place where you know they will honor your warranty and this is NOT AMAZON. It is a great product but please always keep your receipt.

Bottom Line: BUY FROM A SALON- NOT AMAZON, KEEP YOUR RECIEPT, Its a great INITIAL product but may not last long so save your receipt.*",1
I felt this particular bottle's product smelled different than a bottle I had previously bought at a retail store. The smell was somewhat stale or just not as fresh and vibrant as the one I bought at the retail store. I was disappointed.,0
"The curling iron I had used for 10+ years finally died. I was a little afraid to try this because of the small clamp. I'm used to a plain old curling iron.  I have really thick, really long hair. It's naturally wavy but it does have a hard time holding a true pretty curl or beach wave in the Texas humidity.  This curling iron is AMAZING. I'm still working out the timing for my hair because it curls FAST and I over did it the first couple days. But the curls, even brushed out stayed all day and still looked great the next morning.  I was able to curl my hair that would normally take 30-35 minutes in 20 minutes. I'm now a huge fan!",1
"I love this color, is a nice sheer peachy color. I was afraid it would be to opaque when I bought it but it wasn't and blends nicely with my Chestnut liner. Blending is made even better with the built in brush.  The only thing I don't really like is the mechanics of the tube. You have to turn it a lot to get product to come out and then when it does start to come out it doesn't stop right away so you end up losing much of the product if you don't use it. This is also a problem when replacing the cap, product ends up in the cap. So you tend to waste gloss.",1
"as always , the product is great but this color was not. I'm sure there are skin tones that could handle it but it made me look like a corpse",0
Still waiting for my arm hair not to grow. Only have done twice.,1
This is a very good product.  I have colored hair with hi-lites.  I put a pea sized bit in my hands and rub it in my hair after my shower.  It keeps my hair from getting dry and frizzy.  I was out of it for about 2-3 weeks and really noticed the difference.,1
"This is about the only powder foundation that I can use without looking like a powdery aged mess. It does require a good, makeup suitable moisturizer before applying in order to achieve natural finish, as well as good short and firm bristle blending brush.
I have tried this foundation when they first came out and this is a different formula and color (better color), but still it has a really nice blending ability without looking powdery or heavy on the face.
To summarize, below are pros and cons.

Pros:
Good color and pigment which produces nice medium coverage without medium coverage feel
Easy to blend and apply (with the right brush)
SPF 15
Looks natural
Doesn't feel heavy
Wont cause irritation
Covers well
It won't settle into lines
Good for combination skin

Cons:
Doesn't stay on too long
It will clog the pores
Compact case design needs some work (the case needs sponge or brush compartment (all the plastic bulk feels useless and too heavy without room for some type of applicator on the go)
Mirror is too small for an actuall makeup application, and it gets covered with makeup
Can be messy
Somewhat pricey
May be too heavy for summer
May not be suitable for a very dry skin",1
I love this! It takes off all makeup even eye makeup. Just wish the packaging was better as I lost some trying to soak the cotton pads while Turing the bottle upside down,1
This came with a brush not a lippy,1
"This product is worth every dollar! First found it in a salon in Boston. Bought it there. Lasted almost a year.  A little goes a long way. You will not be disappointed. Believe me, I've tried more molding pastes/gels and muds that I can even remember. This is a keeper.",1
Love this cologne on my Honey. It just goes so well with his natural essence.,1
"I used the product after I cleansed and toned my face. Once applied to the skin, at it started removing the dead skin from my face and these white and grey rolls come off. I love the fact that the product has rice ingredients because it really brightens the skin! This product really left my skin super soft and smooth.",1
Great tool - heats up very quickly - easy to use.,1
Box was delivered smashed,0
"This product smells like cheese! It may hydrate but it smells so horrible I hate using it!! Everyone in my office agrees, do not buy unless you don't mind the sent",0
Arrived on time with four different samples! Great!,1
L'ANZA changed the formulation of Healing Style  Mega Gel and it's completely drying and kinda weird.  I've been using this product for years and now on the hunt for a new gel.,0
"Just as noted above, I don't notice a difference. I use it at the base, I've tried using it sparingly and in excess, neither of which seems to make a difference. I have better results with a good ol' bristled teasing brush and hairspray.",0
Couldn't get the lid off the product to screw on the sprayer.  Had to buy another canister in a different size.  still couldn't get the lid off. Then saw at Bed Bath and Beyond you could buy Toppik with the applicator.  Less price too.,0
If you have a real bald spot it just makes it look like fungus is growing on the top of your head,0
"Not bad. Have to use a little more to get the lather I need.
I still prefer the 'Natural Shaving Cream' from Pacific Shaving Company.

Use the following procedure to reduce acne problems:
1. Splash water on face.
2. Apply a little cream to face and rinse with water.
  This is important:
  - Removes dirt and bacteria that may case redness.
  - Removes grease from skin makes razors cut a lot better.
3. With wet hands apply a little cream to wet face
4. Shave rinsing razor frequently
5. Rinse
6. Apply a little cheap Vodka (purest alcohol available)
7. Apply quality facial cream (always from tube, never from a jar to avoid contamination).",1
"Not for me. I've never used a dry shampoo before so I have nothing to compare it to. It makes my hair feel dirtier and a little gritty. This brand was recommended by my hair dresser. I like the feeling of my hair all clean and smooth and I guess that can't be recreated with a powder. Oh well, back to my regular morning routine. I will say that if I was trying to create an updo this would probably help give a lot of texture.",0
I can see and feel my hair getting thicker,1
I have tried many different kinds of liquid eyeliner and this is definitely not worth the money. The line is comparable to water color paint in that it is not a solid black line. I had to go over the line a few times. It seems like the type of product that is expensive only to deceive you into thinking it is of high quality.,0
"Gets so hot roller BURNS your scalp and leaves it sore.

"This is the second Vichy product that I've tried.

This Vichy Purete Thermale 3 In 1 product is a cleansing water, a soothing toner, and an eye makeup remover, all in one product.

I can't speak on how well this product works as an eye makeup remover, because I don't wear eye makeup at all due to very bad allergies, and rubbing my eyes.  Years ago a friend decided to make me up, including eye makeup,and I developed a stye on my eye.  I have to say I looked better with makeup on than without it.  I do wear lipstick or lip gloss daily.  That's it!

This product does do a good job as far as a cleansing water and toner.  I put a little onto a cotton round and wiped it all over my face and neck, then repeated it with another cotton round. It left my skin feeling clean and refreshed, soft and not over dry.

This product is suitable for sensitive skin and eyes, and contains no parabens.",1
"The black pepper scent is perfect. Not too overpowering, not unnoticeable. You can use this and put on your favorite deo/cologne as well. But trust me, you won't need to. The smell is absolutely wonderful. The only problem is its ability as an anti-perspirant. If you have sweat glands which don't quit easy, this won't help much. Overall it's a great product but if you're looking for a pure, back-to-basics anti-perspirant, this isn't your thing.",1
It got me dizzy after couple day of application,0
the color was a little darker and less red than I expected but still a great polish!!,1
"My skin feels very clean and soft after washing. Not tight. The smell is a little too strong in the beginning though, but once I washed it off it's ok.",1
Great!,1
This does not work,0
"Definitely dried out my hair. Didnt see much in the way of protection, wouldnt buy again.",0
Doesn't work on stubborn grays (& they usually are)...not a good buy at all.,0
Works as advertised!,1
"I ordered this for about $30 and returned the one I bought at macy's for $70. I should have known the price was too good to be true. The serial number on the box did not match what was on the bottle so I knew it was fake. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a new one. This time the numbers matched, but I'm still skeptical.",0
Did not work like the first tube I bought-doesn't dry very quickly & rubs off immediately...also clumpier than I remembered.,0
"Pretty good for the price! It's a nice deep color, just tastes a little funny.",1
"This was a reorder item for me. I thought I was getting 8 strips, but only got 4. The ""short"" product description read: Bliss Poetic Waxing Wax Strips for Face, 8 Count . Apparently, a single strip is now counted as 2, since you pull it apart and product is on both sides.  That's misleading. Won't order again.  It was not the same as my previous purchase.",0
Plates do not touch each other I returned,0
It works....but buy applicator for better control,1
"Cleans the hair well. My thin, naturally curly hair does not curl after washing. The hair does not seem heavy or overly clean, just straight. There was a time when I even ironed my hair to straighten it out and could have used this product. Haven't used long enough to know the long term effect. Will use the entire bottle, then evaluate.",1
Amazing moisturizer!,1
This product made me develop a rash / reaction in my underarms. First product of Jack Black to ever cause such a reaction. Luckily I notified the company and they gave me a refill. Beware of this potential side-effect,0
BEST SHAMPOO I HAVE EVER USED!,1
"It's definitely better than the do it yourself glue base coat, but it doesn't last very long. While with a normal base coat my textured polishes could last 7-10 days through cleaning with chemicals and hot showers this base coat barely made it a week before taking a hot shower made it gummy again and it started peeling right away.

You should also use at least 3 coats to make sure it's sticky enough to peel off easily.",1
"I thought that this would work well, since it's a known brand, but, it made me really orange. I'm pretty fair, but, I've used other self-tanners and never turned this orange before.",0
This was a birthday gift for my son in law. He couldn't be happier.,1
this hairdryer is an investment! leaves hair very soft abd shiny does not cause damage like others. I use this daily and rarely cut my hair. This retails for about $300 on other sites ! Trust me your hair will thank you!,1
"The face serum, the moisturizer, or the combination of the two made me break out heavily.  I have even tried stopping the products to make sure they were really the culprit: when I stop them my skin clears up within several days, but a couple of days after starting back up again I break out again.  As much as I hate to waste expensive products I think I'm going to have to just throw them out.  I have continued using the eye serum since I haven't noticed any breakouts around my eye area, but I can't say that I've seen any positive results with that either.",0
"I wrote a previous review on one of the other bosley products and I feel the same about this one so I just did a copy and paste of  that review in each of the products I used.  I Don't know if it was the combination of them or one worked better than another because I used one or the other every day.  Here is the original review:

 I am an afro-american woman, and noticed hair thinning on my crown for several months. I have tried several things to thicken my hair but nothing worked. I bought this product along with the conditioner, shampoo, hair regrowth treatment, and hair folicle energizer, I have only been using these for 4-6 weeks. My hair has always been slow to grow so I haven't seen very much growth. But what I have noticed is less hair breakage. I hardly have hair in my comb now. For me, this is a plus, because before using these products my comb would be full of hair. Hopefully soon I will be able to see my thinning areas filling in.",1
I love the color but it has to be applied frequently.,1
"Wife is happy, I am happy.",1
my husband loves this because it's natural and does a good job,1
"Knocked off 3 stars because the package of wipes was clearly old and was so dirty it looked like it had been sitting on a shelf for a couple of years (note: they were not opened, just the packaging was dirty). The wipes are not as moist as you would expect a new pack of wipes to be, which is disappointing considering how much they cost. They are usable, but I am afraid that they will dry out before I can finish the pack. Will not be ordering these again due to quality.",0
"I've been using this product for nearly two years now, so I think this review may be unique in that respect. I didn't read through ALL of the other reviews, but most seem to be for shorter term experiences.

First off, I am the perfect candidate for this product-- fair skin and dark hair.

After nearly two years of use as recommended (every two weeks at first, then every three weeks, etc.) I am using the unit about once a month to hit stray leg hairs and do full armpit treatments. I make sure I do the treatments on skin that is dry and bare (no lotions or deodorant applied). A slight drawback is that I need to allow my leg hair to grow between treatments so I can see where I need to treat. Because the product is best used on short-haired/shaved skin, at treatment time I dry-shave each visible hair and then zap its follicle. This is the only way to see what areas still need to be treated. If you continue to shave between treatments to get the hairs that remain, you'd have to treat your entire leg each time ($!) to make sure you got all stray hairs.

I have seemingly removed about 50% of my underarm hair.
I have seemingly removed about 75% of my upper leg hair.
I have seemingly removed about 85% of my lower leg hair.
I have seemingly removed about 75% of my bikini line hair.

If you're looking for absolutely bare legs with no fine hair visible in strong sunlight profile views, this is not your product. The hair that does remain on my legs is finer and seems lighter in color, but it's there and I can see it in good lighting. My legs feel smooth and you'd have to look closely at them to see the hair, so it's a matter of personal preference.

I say ""seemingly"" because I don't know what will happen if I cease to use the product. I suspect the hair will all eventually grow back, as I've read that there really is no such thing as permanent hair removal. For now I'm content with continuing to buy the (expensive!) cartridges because of the time I save on shaving my legs. I still feel the need to shave my underarms every day. The cartridges last much much longer now that I'm not treating my entire legs, so that's a bonus.

I called the ""800"" number to see if the cartridges from the pink retail version (this one) and the giant warehouse store aqua version (name withheld so this review isn't censored) are inter-changeable, and the answer I got was very unsatisfactory. I suspect it's a marketing difference only, as the rep could only keep saying that the retail cartridge would work, but was ""formulated differently"". She couldn't/wouldn't expound on this. I verified that the pulses were the same in strength and number, and the cartridge is physically identical, so I don't know what other differences there could be.

I gave this product a ""3"" because it does technically work, but it's not the miracle quick hair removal system some marketing campaigns make it out to be. It takes long-term dedication and cartridge purchasing. The real test would be to see how fast all of the hair grows back, but I'm not about to test that after investing the time and money I have to date.

Review update: I failed to mention that I used the unit at its maximum strength (5) pretty much from the start. You can bypass the first 50 pulses of lower strength by following the directions they give.

Review update 2014: I have now used this product for over 3 years. I upgraded my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars because not only is the machine still working OK, but the hair isn't growing back for the most part, so I'm only doing spot treatments every 2 - 3 months. The percentage of hair removal I mention above is now 70% underarm, 90% upper leg, 95% lower leg, and 85% bikini line. Now that the price seems to have come down substantially I would highly recommend this method to anyone who is willing to work with it long term.",1
Don't waste your money,0
I loved this curling iron for the first two months I bought it. One day it just stopped heating up. I was pretty disappointed because my last curling iron held up for almost 10 years.,0
"Thins out the polish for a few days then it becomes thick and goopy like it was, if not worse.",0
"I had a terrible reaction to this product, especially the pumice peel. I had to use hydrocortisone and Benadryl to make the nasty bumps on my face go away.  Had to stop using and give away.",0
Not really loving this product.,0
This stuff is great.  I was first introduced to this when it was used by the hairdresser at a high class salon I went to long ago and began using it when I wanted my hair to look extra special.  It gives my baby fine hair volume and strength.  I was happy to find this on Amazon.  It is so worth the price.  Just a few sprays where you want volume and strength - only spray an area once (a little goes a long way because you then rub your whole head and comb it through).,1
"This is a FAKE! Moroccanoil is extremely strict about its retailing. Salons have to sign waivers agreeing that they will not sell at discounted rates. Have you ever noticed how Moroccanoil is never on sale at salons? Only certified salons can sell Moroccanoil products, so anything Moroccanoil sold online will virtually be a fake product. I had to learn the hard way, unfortunately.",0
"Yes, I agree, this product is fake!!!  The smell, color and texture is all wrong... It seemed ok at first but with age, it now looks like pus and smells horrible.  I should have said something earlier but after seeing other people with the same feedback I am... I got ripped off.  We should all be reimbursed... I can even send the what is left in the container back to prove it!",0

Received the first time, the use of the product, and previously was not much difference, can prove to be authentic, the skin will not dry after washing, note this is the Oil Control Acne, if not oily skin can choose another Te Anshu money.

"Lorac is my favorite brand for eyeshadow.  They also have an incredible liquid felt-tip liner as well.  Anyway, these shadows don't disappoint at all.  I was looking at the beautiful colors in the new Urban Decay Naked 3 palette, but their shadows always seem a bit overly sparkly to me.  Lorac does a good job of leaning more ""shimmery"" than ""sparkly"" and I like that.  This has a beautiful mix of mattes and shimmers.  The little bottle of primer is always nice and works well, but it irritates my eyes.  I prefer Urban Decay's primer instead.",1

"Like many other reviewers, I have long, thick hair that can take a while to dry.  I do think this one dries my hair faster than other dryers, but there are two things I don't like about it.  One is that the airflow is so forceful that it tangles my hair while I'm drying it.  I have to brush it constantly to get the tangles out while its drying.  The other is that the ""hot"" setting is too hot--I can't leave it on that setting very long without feeling like its burning my hair and skin.  The warm setting doesn't seem warm at all.  Its what I'd call ""cool"".  I want something in between, but this dryer doesn't have it.  Overall, a disappointment",0
"I'd been watching the infomercial with Jane Seymour for quite awhile so I was excited to try this. I've noticed crepey skin in my d&eacute;collet&eacute; area when leaning over. I've used this consistently the past 2 weeks and have noticed no change at all in my skin. This product has an obnoxious scent that makes me cough, is a lot of work that needs to be kept up. I think that my d&eacute;collet&eacute; area looks even drier now than it did when I was using a simple inexpensive facial moisturizer in that area. The same results can probably be obtained by buying a gentle drugstore exfoliator along with a moisturizer for a lot less cost.",0

I like the smell but I never smell it on me.  Perhaps not for me!,1
"This cream made me very excited because its reputation had preceded it and I have seen it in some high end skin spas. I bought it on Amazon, I was even more excited because it was way cheaper than I had seen in stores. However, once I started using the cream, it immediately made my dark circles worse. I woke up the next day looking like I hadn't gotten any sleep at all. This cream claims to work magic on circles and bags, but I have been using it for a month now and it hasn't even slightly improved my under eye situation. I am very disappointed in this false advertisement, but there is a silver lining: it is a luscious cream that I enjoy using for moisturizer on my face. My skin is very sensitive and will break out using most creams, but this one is quite nice!",0
"Ugh. I thought this sounded great to try new things and I planned on using the credit on Supergoop, an awesome Amazon ""luxury beauty"" sunscreen. Nope. The process of trying to find the ""select luxury beauty"" products that you can use the credit on is inconvenient. There will be no $19.99 credit showing up anywhere in your account. Go to your email to find the link, then it takes you to a page of about 640 items you must scroll through to try and find something. The credit will only show up as a deduction after you have selected a ""select luxury beauty"" product and are halfway through the checkout process with it. What I wanted is not a ""select luxury beauty"" product even though it's labeled ""luxury beauty"" Unless you plan on ordering one of the brands that are featured in the box and know you like it, don't bother. The variety of products is just ok; mostly anti aging, tanning towel and hair products. Btw, Only a few products in here are not tested in animals, and non-chemical heavy. That's something I look for in a product and will pay more for. I've heard good things about loccitane but the smell is so over powering, I had to wash it off. I liked the marine cream but at about $120-150 over budget. I definitley feel stuck with this, don't want it and don't really want to buy anything on the list of applicable products. Talked to an Amazon representative who also felt the redeem process was a bit inconvenient. A couple emails later, confirmed I do have a credit. Hours of life lost on Amazon anti aging luxury beauty products...grrrrr....I'm too young for this!  what am I doing here... lol I love Amazon , no worries....let me know when there's a cruelty free/natural beauty box :) time to go watch a 97% solar eclipse with my approved solar eclipse glasses ! Woo hoo",0
"Very strong wind for the size, but a little heavy for the size too. Gave to my mom and she likes it.",1
"it didn't lift or gave body to my hair, it just made the roots more moist and oily greasy, and i do have a lot of fine flat hair. i thought i could activate the spray buy blow drying, it just made it more greasier then before. i wouldn't purchase this again. oh don't get me wrong, i love the smell.",0
slow improvements,1
Love my zoya,1
"It's a struggle to wear SPF 30 on my face every day- but no one wants sun damaged skin! I LOVE Coola SPF 30 for Face- this product is lightweight, smells like refreshing cucumber, and spreads easily over face and neck without adding extra shine. It's perfect to wear alone or under make-up. The quality makes it worth the price!",1
"I did not get the smooth hair I was expecting.  Maybe this works better for people with curly hair, but my straight hair that gets frizzy it didn't do anything for.",0
I have only had this for two months and today it quit working. Wont heat up.,0
"I love the variety in this pallate, yet somehow everything goes together perfectly! I have been able to create so many unique looks from the sampler and discovered a few new ""holy grail"" products! The only reason it doesn't get five stars is that most of the eye shadows have some fall out, which is a little annoying. The color pay-off is great and the pigment lasts all day! Great introduction to the Balm if you are curious about their products!",1
"I recently received a few free samples of this product (along with the after shave) from an Art of Shaving retail store.  The sales associate said that this product can be used with electric razors, however, after trying it, I don't think it works well with an electric razor (I use a Norelco 3-head razor).  I normally use the CVS/Walgreen's brand of Lectric pre-shave lotion, which costs about $5-$6, versus this product, which costs about $38.  Comparatively, the store-brand lotion works 100 times better.  With the Art of Shaving pre-shave gel, it feels like I did not apply anything at all, and my razor does not glide across my face smoothly - like it does with the much cheaper lotion.  I do not recommend this product for electric razors.",0
Great moisturizer but smells like old lady perfume. I only use it when I have a cold so I don't have to smell it.,0
Small,0
Less than a month already stopped working!!,0
Does not condition well at all. Not worth the money.,0
It wasn't what I expected,0
"No matter what other cleanser I try, I RUN back to this one!  Without being harsh on my sensitive skin, it somehow manages to slough off the dead skin on the surface.  I do not have the build up and subsequent dullness to my complexion.  Worth every penny!",1
Ok,1
It's famous cosmetic in the world. It's great! I'm sure i want to buy the same item again. Thank you for chance to buy the item.,1
"I like this shampoo better that all the Pureology.  Not to heavy but not to light. I am not happy with Redken, Pureology is their high priced line, because every time you find one of their products that work for you they stop making it. Redken says ""we changed the formula and repaced it with, blah blah blah"". It is very frustrating now I can not find this at the salons, because they came out with the new and inproved Nano Works Gold.  I bought the Nano Works Gold once, not better and at $99.00 for shampoo and conditioner for 6.8 oz each I am drawing the line at paying that much.  When I can not find this product on line anymore that has not been watered down I an going to stop buying products from Redken/Pureology. Shame on you Redken.",1
Not worth the money hair looked and felt dry stiff,0
The instructions say to scrub the skin with this every day.  This brush is HARD  ....  I mean really HARD.  I started bleeding yesterday in the shower.  I may have old thin skin but I don't think that bleeding is the kind of detox I really need.,0
"My first encounter with Ahava's shaving cream was on a trip to Israel.  It was given to me as a gift.  I was thankful at the time, but my thankfulness grew after I got home and actually started using it.  I have a tough beard, but sensitive skin.  If I shave too frequently, I get razor bumps.  Ahava's shaving cream gives me a smooth, close shave, but without the irritation.  I have been using it ever since.  Highly recommended.",1
Seemed to work fine.  I was pleased with the prompt service!,1
One of my all time favorite day or night moisturizers. Leaves my skin soft and supple and just enough moisture. FYI- the pump from the larger size does fit on the same one!,1
I LOVE it!!!,1
"It's a 5 star product but I wasn't expecting the Hint of Tint version.  It's ok but would have perferred the non-tinted product; hence the 4 star rating instead.  The product itself is terrific. However, the regular non-tinted is MUCH better.",1
This really worked for me easy to use.,1
best product ever!,1
"It doesn't say anywhere that the kit doesn't contain the main fiber!! It only has the spray, the applicator and the hairline applicator!! I tried rerunning it, but you can't return the item! There's no other option but to buy another cream separately! Ridiculous!!!",0
"This was my first experience using something like this [less than a month], and I don't feel like I've seen the results I had hoped just YET, but I think that is due to the fact that I need more time, I plan to update this review.

Pros:
-Easy set up
-Gel is like ultrasound gel [no reaction or rash came from using it on my sensitive dry skin]
-I did not experience redness or pain the next day from treatments
-The beeps were helpful most of the time, sometimes I would lose track counting an area I was treating
-Fit and worked best on my neck [areas like around my eyebrows were more difficult to treat even with attachment]

Cons:
-My only complaint was the pain, it felt like your face was being shocked like when you touch an outlet. I was able to endure it, and got use to it, and I know this is part of the treatment. I just think my novice experience taints this, but because of this I was less excited to do this treatment every evening because of this, but curious to see if it does end up yielding the results it promises",1
I have pure white hair which I inherited from my mother. My hair is very fine so I use this white powder to make sure my pink scalp is not visible around a cowlick I have on the back of my head. I LOVE TOPPIK.,1
"I bought this conditioner because it had great reviews but I was very disappointed with it. It causes my hair to break and is much frizzier than before I used the product. It may just be my hair type because I saw this product got great reviews from others, but it hasn't worked for me unfortunately.",0
This isn't real opi but a knock off. Color is good but quality is seriously lacking.,0
"I'm a committed Arbonne user and mix the StriVectinLABS High Performance Booster Oil with my serum to apply. The oil has a lemon scent that I beleive may be added to cover up a more chemically smell which it mostly does.  For oil, it certainly doesn't make my face greasy in the slightest. It is hard to explain but it does have a mild firming effect.  The closet example I can think of is the way a thin, gel facial mask feels but way less restrictive. The ""mask"" feeling lasts, pretty much all day.  As for my fine lines and wrinkles...no impact there but very well might be if I wore foundation and powder which I don't.",1
Great flat iron! I bought my own after using a friend's and it's the a lot better than the HMI flat iron I previously bought. I have very thick hair and it straightens it with ease. Sometimes I only put a little coconut oil in my hair and sometimes I flat iron iron just after washing and blow drying it with nothing else. Both ways give me great results.,1
"Shaves seem closer, no nicks or cuts.  I like it.  I was a little concerned that I would go through this quickly but I have not made much of a dent in it over the past 2 months.  It comes in a jar and you scoop or brush onto your face.",1
"I really liked this product.  The way it makes my skin very silky, the smell is subtle and feminine.  But when I received it the bottom of the bottle was cracked and now is seeping out the bottom so I have to keep it upside down and dispense it out the crack in the bottom of the bottle.  Not something I would expect for the price I paid for this.  Also, even though I like the fragrance, it is not as ""almond-y"" as I would have liked or thought.  Im on the fence about if I would spend this much money on this product again.",1
"Awful doesn't work! Matted up and appeared chalky, waited too late to return this item and the Toppik hair coloring powder. A wasted of money.",0
I returned this product. Too many small rollers in the set.,0
"BEST BEST BEST MASCARA EVER!!!! Thickens w/out blobs, does not ever become ""crumbly"" and fall off - A TRULY EXCELLENT MASCARA!",1
Love it but soooo expensive!!  Should be half the price.,1
Does give a great curl but clumps up. No matter how much eye remover I used there was always little mascara clumps left over.,0
"I read all the 5 star reviews on this curling iron and I went for it.

I now regret the purchase, while it does get hot, it does not get hot enough for my hair. I also don't recommend this size for loose fat Victorias secret curls. Go with the 1 1/4, and also a different brand. I have heard many good things about Hot tools, but I cannot recommend this curling iron for thick coarse hair. (I can't speak for thin hair)",0
No smell at all..... What a rip off!!!!!!!!!,0
not worth the money. its an okay product.  I wouldn't buy again.,0
This item does not do what it advertises it does. I'm really disappointed with it.,0
I have purchased 2 of these.  They are not inexpensive.  They work great while they are functional.  However both stopped working after 1 year.,0
the bottle arrived with half empty !!!!,0
Not what she wanted . It was returned.,0
I would have given this product 5 stars....however...it isn't cleaning as it once did....this is my 5th bottle and I believe it will be my last..,1
WASTE OF MONEY!!!! The bristles on this brush are so small that they are practically non existent. This causes my lashes to stick together and I have no way of separating them. What a waste of money. Now I have to go out to the store and by one that works. I'm spending double NOW!!,0
Great product,1
"First, the color on this worked very well.

You do need more to use more product than I would like to cover trouble spots and it felt a little heavy.  You do need to work to blend it correctly so that it looks flawless.

It was good for my sensitive skin - no redness or irritation.

I'm also scent sensitive, but had no issues with the scent here.

I'll continue to use for the occasional trouble spot.",1
Doesn't stay on my babyliss blow dryer when it gets hot!,0
"First off, let me say the colors are absolutely GORGEOUS. It's so hard to find a pigmented organic eyeshadow that has exceptional color payoff. My only issue is that I feel like the color needs to be retouched after about 6 hours. But, I still think it's worth it. It's small enough to bring in a purse or clutch, that a second application later on would be easy. Will definitely buy again.",1
"Item as described, very prompt shipping",1
I actually detached the part that you lever up with your thumb and use it as a wand. The temperature dial allows me to get the perfect curl every time and I have extremely stubbornly straight hair.,1
"This product left two dark scars on my face, I used as directed.  I have never had an acne scar in my life, I now have two scars at the age of 33 due to this product.  Be very careful using this if you have sensitive skin or are sensitive to alcohol based product.  I have now switched to First Aid Beauty and have seen nothing but success.  Stay away from Mario as his products either contain Alcohol, Mineral oil, artificial fragrances and so on... There is a reason why they are so inexpensive.  The ingredients are cheap, not just the packaging.",0
"Not a very pleasant experience with this product. I have thin and long hair, getting volume and thickening hair was my goal when I purchased this product. It had so many great reviews, so I decided to try. i received shipment fast, no problems with packaging. Shampoo made my scalp and hair very dry however. Very dry hair and itchy scalp- not good! I've noticed that I am losing more hair too.
As a result, my hair looks much worse as it used to. My bottles are only half full now, but I can't take it any more. I have to switch to another brand, or I will end up being bold.",0
"I have course wavy hair, and this stuff does nothing to my hair, with a small amount of product, or hardens it with a bit more. I don't understand why it's rated so high. It must just be good advertising. If you really want a pomade, not a thick gel, check out bumble and bumble simisumo. You use very little product, it keeps your hair flexible and it will last for days if you don't wash your hair everyday.",0
"Excellent product, very high quality, really recommend it, product purchased and imported into Venezuela",1
"I like the roller set and it's OK, BUT I guess I was expecting bigger things! It does what it states it will do but not on my hair! I may need to work with it more and get more comfortable using it! More details later?",1
This candle smells like your eccentric old aunt's guest room. You know--the one who uses scented sachets in the bureau drawers and feeds you expired biscuits for tea.,0
wrong color  much too dark..i started with the screen light brown..when ti switched over to choices and prices it decided to make all of those darkbrown and I foolishly did not notice it...so we are stuck with it.,0
"It holds very well, but my son has a hard time getting it all washed out.  His hair looks great though!",1
"Ordered the green discs. They arried promptly, but were too short. I received the PMD device as a Christmas gift.  I loved it and needed to order replacement discs. I ordered these from Amazon instead of the device web site in the hopes of saving on shipping and based on other reviews. I received the discs and they were not the color of the ones I already had. That concerned me, but i thought well I don't care about the color. I got them home and put them on the device and they were too short. I pulled the disc up so it would extend closer to the opening, still too short. In order to get it anywhere near the opening it had to be lifted almost to the tip. It does swirl around, but does not seem to be as effective. I began to wonder if the abrasionon of the disc was inferior as well, but I think it is related to the fact the disc is so close to the tip it is not getting the full power of the device's rotation.

I have traiditonally had good luck with my Amazon purchases, so I purchased them again. Same results. Unfortauntely, I was out of town when they arrived and was unable to return them. I will not buy these again from Amazon. I am looking at the PMD web site for my next purchase.",0
"I have ordered 2 of these dryers over the past 2 months and both of them stop working on the ""high"" switch.  The dryer will work on ""low"" but not ""high"".  I used on of the dryers only 2 weeks before this started happening.  Others have had this same issue so there seems to be a problem with faulty switches lately.  I had another one of these dryers that lasted years and really liked it so its a shame this is happening.",0
"I bought this product to condition my hair which are brown with some lightening whitening. to my surprise my hair turned red, totally different from what I like. the cream is already red inside, I do not recommend it.",0
Leaves nicks when shaving. Is stylish but not had to go back to my disposable Gillet. Would not recommend.,0
"I like the iron a lot, except that the leg it sits has already broken off and the coating the iron is already coming off
So I really would not repurchase one of these",1
I actually love the color... but it stained my nails terribly.  It's over a month since I've taken it off and my nails are still green.  I've never had a nail polish do this - with or without a base coat!,0
love this product,1
"Blonde doesn't cover much. Bottle is TINY! It's like 2.5"" tall.",0
For some reason the mask isn't making my hair look as nice as when I first started using it. Doesn't smell like lavender but more of an oil smell. Won't be buying this again. No longer makes my hair smooth and shiny. Very disappointed.,0
I have a few other Orbie products that I've purchased directly from the Orbie website and the logo/ letters on this one look different. Not sure this is an Orbie original.,0
This product has blown me away!  I have been getting very large painful blemishes recently. I have tried salicylic acid and other drug store remedies with unsatisfactory results. But the Payot is amazing.  As soon as a blemish starts I apply and it is stopped in it's tracks. I love this product.,1
When twisting the brush any stray hairs get caught in the silver ring where the handle connects.,0
My husband says this is the best hair product he's ever used.  It's a nice consistency and keeps his hair in place without looking like he has product in it.,1
"If I wasn't heading back out of the country I would return this product. The exfoliate is too hard, like sand paper and the lipstick doesnt stay up in tube when applying. Very disappointing for my favorite brand. Dont waste your money on this one. I should have read the reviews before purchasing",0
Nothing to write home about,0
luv it,1
"AHAVA simply doesn't perform as well as even a store-bought shaving cream and it's five times the price. There are some reviews on here stating that the formula has changed, and maybe it has. There are certainly some nice things about it. The fragrance is wonderful, it's very refreshing and a little bit goes a long way but this just doesn't leave your face very slick. I regularly use two shaving creams. Barbasol when I travel. Cremo at home. Both of those give me a much better shave than this does.",0
Heavy and makes my hair smell burnt.,0
"I want to love this product, but it breaks me out whenever I try to use it.  Unfortunately it is part of a bucket of products I don't use.",0
"Either the productive is defective, or it is a scam.
Nothing happens when I twist the pen. There is just a tiny tip of product and is gone after a few uses and I do not use much.
However, it does stay on a long time and does not smudge.",0
"Be very careful when ordering this item.  Just because you receive a blue curler doesn't mean its a real Babyliss.  I received mine today and while I think it could be a useful tool it is not worth the price I paid due to being a counterfeit.  The curler I received was a darker shade of blue than Babyliss produces, the box was wrapped in solid colored plastic (probably to hide the fact that it might not be the real thing from Amazon, who fulfilled the order), the water tank had water in it and there was a grayish blue felt pad on the small round end cap of the interior rod instead of a plastic end cap like in ALL the photos of the actual product (and which was also wet). I have to return it because I ordered and paid for Babyliss quality only to get something that was obviously used and of undetermined quality.",0
"I had to return this item because it was used.
I ordered a new hair styler and when I opened it it had hair on it.
Rosanne Ruva",0
So moisturizing! My favorite lip gloss. Beautiful shiney finish.,1
Very small quantity for price. Misleading and disappointing.,0
Good quality. Product as expected.,1
Best foundation I've ever had.,1
It has OPIs traditional prowide brush. The formula is a bit thin so two coats are required. The color itself is deep plum that was a bit darker then I expected (hence 4 stars not 5). A very lovely color for winter if you enjoy deep plum shades. I definately recommend this to all purple lovers.,1
still use it is really good  nice to have it..I like it. will tell more for use long time....,1
"I loved the color so I purchased the CND base and top coat recommended for the polish-I have a UV  dryer lamp already.

I'm not an idiot and know how to give myself a manicure.  This product, which ended up costing me more than a professional manicure would after buying the recommended base and top coats, as well as the polish wouldn't have been bad IF it would last.

It doesn't.

Additionally the polish was gloopy, didn't flow off the brush at all and I ended up pouring some into a glass cup and adding polish remover to try and get a smooth texture.  I applied and removed this polish 4 times the first time I tried it and still ended up with a smeary manicure. Even thinning a bit of it didn't help the application process. I loathed the texture of the polish.  Coverage was also poor-it took 5 coats of the slightly diluted version and 4 coats direct from the bottle to get good coverage-it isn't called a translucent polish but it sure worked that way for me.

This was my first experience with CND product and I'll never waste my money on another bottle of their polish.  At least I can use the base and top coat with other brands-I hope.

I can't recommend this brand if this is typical of their product.

Fortunately there are a lot more turquoise colored polishes out there that are better than this one.  I especially like the OPI Turquoise green color ""Dont Mess With OPI"" and the China Glaze ""Turned up Turquoise"" for a true turquoise blue that stays on and doesn't chip readily, is smooth to apply and literally flows from the brush.  Either are a great improvement over this CND product.",0
The color is not that pink as in the picture. It's more brownish,0
"Several years ago I had purchased a blowdryer with a similar attachment. I absolutely adored that thing - you could use it on the top of your hair or the sides to give lift so your hair had volume without using any product or doing any backbrushing. The thing was a miracle worker!

Then we entered the era of pin straight hair, and volume and body were out. Thank God, we seem to be passing that era, but hairstyling implements seem to be lagging behind. I was dying to try this diffuser to see if it emulated the gizmo from long ago, and it does. Well made hair styling tool that gives lift and volume to your hair, I love it. Well, kinda.

I'm not sure how 'universal' this is. I tried it on my current blowdryer, and it didn't fit. I had to go digging around until I finally found a Conair dryer upon which it fit, and the funny thing is that it fit like it was MADE for the dryer. The odd thing is that the Conair looks to have the same kind of nozzle the other blowdryer had, so go figger.

IF you have a blowdryer that marries this diffuser well, this is definitely something you're going to want in your hair arsenal. It'd almost be worth getting a new dryer just to use this, it's that good (one star off for the weirdess of the 'universal' claim.)",1
"I live in Florida and now that I'm retired, I don't wear make-up much anymore.  I have very fair skin with some blotches and imperfections.  There are times that I want to have a little bit of coverage to help even out my skin.  I actually used this product on my face to set foundation and found it to be very nice.

I have never had any training on how to use make-up properly.  I truly love the Internet because you can search anything and find clear instructions and videos.  Even on the Dermablend Website, you will find some useful tips and clear instructions.  You can even go to a department store that sells this brand for some guidance, proper methods of applying, and what color combination is best for your skin.",1
It was dried out,0
"this product is not original, the aroma fades quickly",0
"I was looking into this product and was almost going to purchase it to try to brighten my dark spot. But then I looked through the ingredient list and found hydroquinone used together with resorcinol. I have read from several sites that hydroquinone should not be used in combination with resorcinol because it can darken the spot (Hundreds of ochronosis cases have been documented from using resorcinol/hydroquinone combination treatments in South Africa before 1984 (Journal of Dermatological Treatment, [...]). Perhaps in low concentration it is ok. Everyone should take a look at this article to learn about hydroquinone [...].
Ultimately, I didn't purchase the product because I was a little worried.....but it might be fine since so many people have used it. Who knows? but I am going to try to find an alternative to this....",0
Don't care for this product. It's easier to use the mascara type root cover. This one ends up coloring your scalp too which looks unnatural. It's especially noticeable on the hair around my face. I will probably use it on the hair away from my face and just use my others scars type cover for that area.,0
it is good for the product,1
I have used this item twice and it has already wrippef at the seam.,0
"I'm on the quest for the perfect dry shampoo and I picked up the travel/tester size of this product.  My sister and I both tried it...  We both have thick and oily hair.  The product worked well in that it did remove the oil and give a little lift to both her straight and my curly hair, but I wouldn't say a lot better than baby powder.  Her hair is a chestnut-brown and even after rubbing it in she looked pretty gray!  But worst of all was the smell.  I like verbena, so I thought I wouldn't mind its lemon-verbena smell, but really I felt like the Pine-Sol lady for the rest of the day.  I guess you either like the smell or you don't.  If you're fair-haired (blond, white, gray, etc), and like the smell of lemon cleaner - go for it.  Otherwise, there are better options.",0
"This is a really great straightener, however Im really disappointed with it at the moment. My sister bought me this flat iron last year in June or July and I take excellent care of it. Always unplug it when Im done using it and store it in a dark, cool place when its not in use. I wrap the cord exactly as it comes out of the package as to not stress it. Earlier this week, I was using it to curl my hair as I usually do and out of no where it started popping and sizzling right next to my head as I was pulling a strand of hair through. I pulled it away from my head right away and looked at it because I was startled and it continued to pop and sizzle and I saw the plates sparking and smoking. I unplugged it immediately and set it on the counter and haven't tried to use it since because Im scared it will catch fire or injure me. Ive had the flat iron for less than a year and this should definitely not happen. Super disappointed and now I need to buy a new flat iron which I was not anticipating and really didn't want to spend the extra money on right now. Bummer.",0
Works as intended,1
"Made my hair stiff and helmet like.  After one use, have thrown the hairspray away and will never purchase again!",0
I love this product but I am giving it 2 stars because I repurchased this from beautyand and they basically sent me hand sanitizer in this bottle. The product may have some alcohol in it but the smell was unusually over powering and I have purchased 5-6 bottles of this and that shouldn't be the case. Be warned!,0
"I love it. Obsession just smells great. Had great service, got here really quick. I am totally happy with it.",1
This is an awesome night cream. The only reason I'm not using it right now it because I'm pregnant and it has retinol in it. Otherwise I would never stop! It feels so velvety going on. Looking forward to using it again once the baby is born!,1
Worked great for 8 months then suddenly one plate stopped working. Since the product was in warranty period I sent it to Paul Mitchell for replacement. Poor customer service from Paul Mitchell paid more than $20took more than one month for them to tell me that they cannot refund or replace the product since it was purchased from Amazon even though I had told them that I purchased it on amazon first time I called them. The product is great but buy it from licensed distributor.,0
"I didn't notice any change in my skin. I really didn't like this product at all., It was a waste of money.",0
"If I could mark this as no stars I totally would being that I received a product that's not even a foreo brand product!

"I have adult cystic acne. I have done Isolaz (laser treatment for acne) in the past which cost $1200 for 4 treatments and it did clear my skin but I still break out though not as much.

I had to stop and continue to use Proactiv+. I do not recommend this product if you have persistent hormonal cystic acne like me. Trust me I've tried antibiotics, laser etc.",0

"Having used REDKEN products before, I found the paul Mitchell Men product to work better by holding the style longer in the day.",1
Nice,1
It looks like if you put makeup vase on hair! Like makeup powder,0
Not very hydrating; and I've been breaking out (it's oily but not hydrating)! Switching to something else.,0
"Ive now had this 5.2 oz jar for almost 6 weeks, and I'm probably 60% done with it, and I shave pretty much everyday. You should plan on getting a shave brush, it's difficult to use with your hands since the shave soap is nearly in solid form.

There's a reason Poraso has been in business so long. Probably the best value out there.",1
"Can't wear it around my neck because the rope is way too small, but hanging it over the shower head will do, mainly for the intoxicating smell.",1
"The color is darker than it appears in picture. I have tried 13 different J I shadows and this is my favorite primary color, and dark suede is my favorite contrast one. I have green eyes",1
"Pretty color. Product coats like paint, feels dry and annoying, does not last long, have to poke/jimmy the applicator brush frequently to keep product coming. I don't plan to buy again.",0
Slow drying.,0
The product I received was NOT the one shown here - it was the 7oz not 11oz.,0
Cuts really well. A little difficult to use. Unfolding to get into cutting position is a little screwy.,1
This product is perfect for creating that gravity defying style. It turned out to be cheaper than the Boost powder by American Crew but works similarly,1
Great color for my hazel eyes.,1
I am a hairstylist and I love and use this daily! Have purchased several for other customers as well! Great product!,1
the price has been raised from a week incredbly,0
"Cargo has a winner with this product.  Coverage comes with a light touch and looks so natural that no one will know you are wearing makeup.

I would highly recommend this product!",1
"The lotion itself has good formulation; I personally did not react well to it. When dealing with AHA/BHA exfoliants, make sure to test them out first. Using this and then other AHA containing lotions later on I realized I was reacting badly because my skin does NOT like AHA exfoliants whatsoever. If you know AHA is your thing then I'd say go for it, if not stay away.",0
"This product did not work for me. My eyelashes did not curl as good as other lash curlers. Also I didn't like the Revitalash mascara. It seemed to be very heavy on the eyelashes, not a nice look.",0
does nothing different than Salley Hansens,0
"This product was not delivered in the original packaging. It was in the box, but the tube was not wrapped in tamper resistant plastic. I'm positive it was tampered with because it was gone after only a couple of weeks of use.",0
"Don't know how, but these little dots are amazing and they totally work on pimples and blemishes!!!  I will forever have them on hand (or face lol)",1
"The best hand lotion ever!  I love using this lotion. After your hands are moisturized, they feel great for hours and look good too. It has a pleasant scent, nothing over powering, just a subtle fragrance. It's pricey, but worth it if your hands are dry and tight.",1
it doesnt work,0
"Okay, I'll be honest.  At night before going to bed I don't always wash my face, but I do use these pads to clean off the daily grime and the astringent tightens my skin.  I'm happy with the result, even when I get up in the morning.  I've using and staying in supply of these pads for years and have travelled with them throughout Europe, Afghanistan, Dubai and Thailand and they've been that in a hurry back up.  I could even recommend them after a good shower to tighten up the skin.  I can't make any claim to their ability to reduce poor, but at 67 I'm amazed at how tight mine are, whatever the cause.",1
"I liked the feel and texture of this product and the fact that it is a mineral sunscreen with a high SPF protection  However it was way too dark for me  I had purchased  this product intending to use it as an all in one treatment, primer and make up  I would recommend this product if it were available in more options than just a medium skin tone  Should be available in light and dark as well as medium skin tones",1
Got this product and it did curl but not for the entire day. I order electrical curl and it worked even better. Save your money not as good as I thought it would be.,0
Great product! Super light on skin and easy to pump out the product. I do wish there was more product in the bottle though.,1
"I've been using this soap since December 2016 and I've got to say it works amazingly well for me. I have oily skin; with other soaps as soon as 20 minutes after washing my face I could feel the grease creeping up. Not with this one, though. I felt the difference from the first time I used it. Even at night, I used to wake up with a greasy face even after washing my face before bed, but since I started using this soap, that hasn't happened to me. I sometimes get the ocassional break out, but I believe this soap has helped my face stay under control. I buy it through Amazon because it's cheaper than at the stores in my neighborhood, where it costs more than double the price it is sold here.",1
"I've been using the body wash and lotion for a month, and have seen minimal results. I have noticed reduced bumps but no reduction in redness.",0
Very light weight and drys my hair fast. The only thing I don't like about it is the controls on the side get hit accidentally.,1
"Love, love, love it. A classic scent of spices soft, yet unforgettable.",1
My wife hated it...it wouldn't blow hardly any hot air at all and took forever to dry her hair.  Sent it back for a refund and will not buy again!,0
very good,1
"I love this spray but i'm not exactly sure what it's for. It smells AMAZING! I have tried to set my makeup with it as it says you can do on the bottle and not sure how well it actually works as a makeup setter. I think it also makes me break out (but most things do). Overall, it smells amazing and is very refreshing",1
at first it worked wonders but the a few weeks later started falling apart .... now i have to order a different one cause it does curl anymore!!,0
"Love this gloss. It isn't that long lasting but it is moisturizing and the color is excellent. It creates a natural looking blush on your lips, not too shiny.",1
too drying,0
"Perfect for touch ups when you don't want to get a manicure every day for 10$, even better for those with real nails",1
"This product is a beauty ""life saver"" for those of us with thin hair. My hint is to be sure & use hair spray after applying it; that being said, it then stays in place...doesn't flake or run at all.  The price from this vendor was awesome!",1
"weak action, no charger converter included.",0
Doesn't work on medium length hair,0
It has a creamy white look.  I was thinking it would be clearer but I use it because of my permanent makeup.,1
"This product made my hair feel extremely brittle and dry, more so than any other purple toning shampoo I have used. On top of that, the smell of this product is truly nauseating, and as other reviewers have pointed out, some of the chemicals have a high toxicity rating. I recommend passing on this one and trying another purple shampoo.",0
I am a yoga fan and Evian spray is the perfect way to cool down after a good class.,1
Did not Last very long!!!!!,0
"I own a ton of red lipsticks and lip glosses, but this one certainly takes the cake as one I'll buy again. A deep blood red that is very liquid and easy to spread, smells sweet, and stays on for hours but comes off easily. I don't buy a lip color twice, but I'll definitely revisit this one.",1
"Super transparent and thin, needed to do 3-4 layers before you couldn't see my nail bed through it",0
Favorite tinted sunscreen.  I'm asked on a regular basis what I use.  The coverage is light but just enough to cover sun damage (blend freckles) and create the illusion of healthy skin. :)  I tried to order from another company but was waitlisted and they finally issued a refund after several weeks.  This company shipped it straight away.  I'm a happy girl!,1
Bought the second one because I wanted a back up for the one I have had for about two years.  Used at once a day and it really is the perfect curling iron,1
"I returned it as soon as I tried it. It does not stay warm and your hair slips out of the clip area. I thought Hot Tools was going to have a good quality curling iron, but I honestly prefer my $25 ConAir iron that I bought from CVS.",0
Love it!!!,1
"Have used this mascara for several years now. The quality of the product I received from this seller is great! I love this mascara because it never smudges and comes off easy when you rub your eyes (eyelashes) with water. I never have an issue with it when I go swimming either. It'll come off eventually in water, but never with an awkward blackness around my eyes. Highly recommend this product.",1
"This made my hair greasy and flat. I had to wash it again. Maybe I'm not using it right, but this is the worst Oribe product and I use their products all the time.",0
"My adult daughters (in their 20's with smooth skin tone) both use this product and like it a lot! For me, though, it is just OK or worse. Since I am older (age 54), it leaves dark spots here and there on my legs, although I like the color. Also, on my arms along the inside of the elbow, I get a little case of hives within two days of using it. I have tried three times now, and it happened all three times (one time I got hives on the back of my legs a little bit). I even used it without exfoliating this last time to make sure I was not irritating the skin area prior to its application. Anyway, I rated it a 4 due to my daughters not having a problem with it, but I can't use the product anymore :(",1
"I have used this color many times at the local nail salon. The polish I received in my Amazon order was thick and had a deeper color, which I believe are signs that the product I received was really old.",0
Really love the velvet feeling of this lotion and the soft pleasant fragrance.  I get compliments on the yummy smell.  Leaves a slight 'filmy' feel on my hands for a few minutes and then absorbs nicely.,1
"This works great. Very different from gels or foams, but sure works good, and makes your face very smooth. I will order again.",1
I've used quite a few different makeup setting sprays. I received this in my Sephora Play bag. It smells awful! I would never purchase this. You're better off buying the Mario Badescu makeup setting spray because it smells amazing like rose petals.,0
Long time user. Great product. Good scent too!,1
"I like the product, but I don't know if the price is really worth it.  I hate the packaging, specifically the pour spout.  It is liquid like water, makes a big mess or wastes product, no in between.  I ended up putting it in a spray bottle and it works much better.  I wanted the coQ-10 part of the toner, but I don't know if it is making much of a difference than other toners especially for the price.  Do I hate it--no.. Would I buy it again...probably not.",1
"The best tanning product I have ever found. It does have a slight smell, and it is almost like a skunk (sorry), although others have told me they smell nothing at all. I like the fact that I can choose to use just one half body towel on certain areas, or I can use two to do my whole body. I gave it 4 stars because the spray is really not necessary. Now when I reorder, I order just the towels. You can also buy full body towels. I also like the fact that there is no color. I usually do this before bed and shower off in the morning, so I hate walking around at night and going to bed with that dark orangey look. I would rather no look at all.",1
"If you don't use Mario Badescu's products you're missing out!  His products are natrual and reasonably priced.  I'm in my late forties and when a co-worker told me I have great skin, I jumped for joy.  And purchsed several products for her, for Christmas and yes, she uses them everyday.  I also got my boss hit on his products.  Effective, ship quickly and you'll also receive three free samples with every order.",1
Great brand but too oily for my skin !!,0
"I have been battling acne for 20 years.  I've literally tried everything... all of the otc and prescribed topicals, all of the antibiotics, all of the treatment lines in the infomercials, chemical peels, food allergy testing, and I've taken 4 courses of Accutane.  Things help for a little while and then my skin gets used to it and it doesn't help anymore.  This product smells much better than the sulfer mask I was using, but it doesn't do a thing for me.",0
"The smell is nice and it works fine for everything EXCEPT waterproof mascara. But if you wear waterproof mascara, you're going to need something else to deal with that. Pretty annoying considering that the description says ""thoroughly removes all traces of make-up from face, eyes and lips.""",0
"I got the sample pack of 4 at Sephora the other day and decided to try the black mask today. The color was startling at first (I didn't think it would be literally pitch black!). I put the mask on and go look at reciews here on Amazon. Several said to beware hair (eyebrows, mainly) so I made sure to wipe off my eyebrow areas before the mask set. Thank GOD I did. The mask solidified and was like a huge face-sized bandaid. It did hurt to peel off and it did in fact pull some of my baby hair out (not too much, but the mask is definitely capable of it).

The end result: I have awesome skin right after removal. I put some moisturizer on overnight and will hopefully wake up with radiant skin.

Caution: do NOT put on hair line/eyebrows. Painful removal. Excellent end results.",1
"I used this product for years without any problems. Did they change the formula? The other night, I fell asleep with the mascara on, when I got up to go to bed and washed my face, I noticed my eyelashes were half the length! I used to love that the mascara wouldn't smudge or run and easily washed off, but the loss of eyelashes is HORRIBLE!",0
I've only had this product for 5-6 months and it no longer works. I've followed all the directions for cleaning and maintaining. Very frustrating.,0
Authentic and amazing stuff!!,1
Perfect if you are looking for a soft smell. Not too strong of a smell,1
"Better than shaving cream, will never go back.",1
"Smell is annoying seen no difference in my hair after 2 weeks I don't recommend.  products ""10"" works way better",0
"This item was dry and empty when I opened it.  The previous times I had ordered were fine, but not this time.",0
"I have fine hair that gets oily fast. I have tried lots of different dry shampoos and I just do not like the sprays. They smell terrible, feel sticky/hard on my hair, and the bottles run out so fast.

I had my first bottle of this stila hair refresher for years and just bought my second! So don't let the high price fool you. This lasts a long time. I don't love the applicator, because sometimes I'll get a little too much of the product in one place, but I've gotten better at applying it. I prefer this SO much over spray dry shampoos. My hair feels normal afterwards, not sticky/hard. I won't use anything else anymore.",1
Returned it. Didn't work well for me.,0
"Not the color I thought it would be.  Yes, it's hard to tell on a computer monitor, but I had seen it in a store also.  I knew what it looked like in the bottle, but it looked different on my nails.",0
Only received 1,0
The best shaving cream I have ever used.  I bought the first jar at one of their stores and it lasted 9 months.  I can't stand to use my old shaving ceam I used to use and ordered another one of these.  Great stuff.,1
Leaves a white residue in my pores. I am very disappointed in this product. I thought it would be a much better product considering it was not cheap. I expected a better cream.,0
The smell is awful... Stays forever and it's so pungent. Don't like it.,0
The picture online of the product is not the same as I received.,0
smells funny like its old,0
"I ordered a bunch of wen products and for me, I was disappointed. Had high expectations but will stick to my garnier products. Sad!",0
"Recommended by a friend, see no difference in hair at all",0
No,1
"This product smells so nice! I use it on my baby's face a couple times a day and on his bottom once a day. He has acne right now (he's two weeks old) and I'm hoping this works on it. I feel like at least I'm cleaning his face and it's very gentle, no rinse is definitely convenient!",1
"The smell is so fresh and clean. If added to the bath with a the jets on, it's fine. To use as a body wash, the lather is not enough. For the price I expected more.",0
"My dermatologist prescripted this one, loved the smell, good for hidratation but Im not sure if it really works as a good anti-aging product!",1
The drying mask I received was produced in 2014!!! It is already been two year and typically Mario Badescu's products are good for six months. WORST shopping experience.,0
"Just what I wanted.  Light, fresh scent that doesn't offend my sensitive nose or give me a headache.  Gave a 4 because it does wear off quickly.",1
Leaves hair feeling sticky!,0
Great product; not greasy.,1
"I love this product so much. I have super oily skin and this strips ALL of the oil off of my face. You only need a small amount because it foams up super fast. It smells nice too. I usually use Burt's Bee's, but that is too oily for me now. I am unfortunately out of this ATM, but I definitely recommend it if you're oily and want to strip your skin. Just make sure to moisturize a bit after because otherwise you'll just get oily again super fast (I didn't used to know this).",1
I use the Korres Pomegranate Balancing Cream - Gel Moisturizer but I needed a toner to use before that step.  I love the smell of the Korres Pomegranate line and the toner works great! My skin feels completely clean after use with no residue. This product is more expensive than some others but I love the scent and the results.  I have ordered it several times and will continue to do so.,1
"Omg! Finally found something tht does the job--I mean I was desperate--and I knew there had to be something out there to serve the purpose ""affordably speaking""...and this is it--the downside--is hvg to use a hair spray to seal it--although it's understandable?! but nvr the less annoying--upside--it's a lot cheaper on Amazon--than the local beauty supply stores!!",1
"There is no scalp massage bristles, this brush will scalp you if you push at all. I do not have a sensitive scalp, but this brush is HARD.",0
This polish must be old! Will not go on smoothly starts pealing off in 1 day.  Very dissatisfied with this one bottle  This is a good brand. Not this bottle!,0
Although I am a fan of the Big Sexy haircare line I was not impressed with this particular product.  It has a weird feel when you put it on your roots and I did not get that much lift from it.  I wouldn't buy it again. Not all products are a good fit for all people.  This one definitely is not a good fit for me.,0
"I use this on my short hair that has a lot of razor-cut texture.  It's far from making my hair ""wild"".  It seems kind of thick, but creamy at the same time.  It's good at making my hair soft and bouncy, which is sort of the opposite of what I was actually looking for. Now that I'm growing out my short cut, I still use this.",1
"Application:
 After her your skin thoroughly cleaned and dried you,
can use their device. For this you have it on the included power cord
connect and load a disc in the unit.

Discs are on the exfoliating discs that exist in different sizes and thicknesses
gives. What I find particularly good is that there is a so-called training disc,
with which you can practice the application once without exfoliate equal los.
It is also recommended to practice only once at less sensitive parts of the body,
as right in the face - because allowed to the peeling disc too long in one place,
there may be strong reddening of the skin.

If ye are prepared ye shall the device to your face on - it creates a vacuum
and the peeling disc is rotated on the skin. Therefore it is important to your device after
Outdoor pull, so that the vacuum is maintained, but moves on.
These should streamline its your skin with the other hand.
So you worked your whole face.

After treatment should wash your faces and a calming toner ,
and moisturizing cream .
Your face may then feel easily irritated and reddened ,
which should have the next day but given .
The application should it not more than once every 6-7 days to perform .

You can tell by the application really clear how much softer and smoother
the facial skin has become . This type peeling is really very effective !
I have seen promising pre-post pictures I unto you
can not offer because my facial skin ( knock on wood ! ) by nature
is very smooth and fairly straightforward .
But googling you through times .

The purchase price is really high , but if you a rather complicated
have facial skin , I can tell you really suggest you to try the Microderm .",1
I have been taking these pill for at least 4 months (maybe more as I've lost count) and I'm still waiting for this to work. I think I'll give up once this bottle is empty. I was impressed with the reviews and kept order bottle after bottle giving it a fair chance to work. I'm still waiting!,0
"I have dry, sensitive skin and it's difficult to find products that don't irritate my skin. I started using this product when I was pregnant. I was told by an ULTA employee that it doesn't contain all the bad stuff prevalent in other products. I absolutely love it. It provides light coverage and doesn't irritate my skin. Highly recommend.",1
Way too much fragrance for me.,0
I love this facial spray. I spray this on my face right before putting on any type of facial moisturizer to avoid pulling on my skin. I find that I also need less product and everything goes on more smoothly. It's also a great refresher in the summertime.,1
It's light and works freat,1
"Not impressed, I am a very pale person and it did not change my skin pigmentation at all.",0
"I love the smell and the way it coats the hair.  I only wish it wasn't so expensive...This is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. I have 2 daughters with long curly hair so the bottle doesn't last very long. Other than that, I really love this product and will continue to purchase it.",1
"Loved it at first but it broke within a year after only occasional use. something wrong with wiring... I turn it on and heat it up, but it shuts off when I lift to straighten a section.",0
"I bought a clarsonic Mia 2 from this seller, only for it to break after 2 months.  Clarsonic customer service advised me that he is not an authorized seller and that it was most likely a fradulent product.  READ the other reviews and beware.  If i would have read these ahead of time instead of just going by the stars, I would never have bought from this seller.",0
"I may be used to a heavier foundation as this one seems really light.  I need a bit more coverage, and am able to achieve a nice look when I apply a base, let it set a bit, and apply another.  I usually have no time in the morning to fuss with my make-up, so I have been using this when I'm not in a hurry.  I think it will be great in the summertime, since it is lightwieght.",1
"Excellent face wash.  I received a sample at my dermatologist's office and when it was empty couldn't wait to buy full size.  It has a very fresh fragrance, takes make-up off and leaves my skin feeling wonderful!  I have dry skin, am 55+ years young and this is one product I will never be without!",1
This product blends well with blonde hair especially around the face where the color fades quickly.  Taking the gray out helps the color process to last between  applications.  It does last between shampooing. Easy to apply.,1
Good!,1
"""Nia"" stands for niacin, and if you search PubMed, you'll find that the doctors who founded Niadyne, creators of the Nia24 skin care line, have conducted extensive peer-reviewed research on the effects of niacin, and specifically niacin+retinol. If you want to use skincare that is backed by scientific evidence and a devoted fanbase, Nia24 deserves a place on your list.

As a longtime retin-a user who has no problem with the hard stuff, I really like this cream: the consistency, the mild scent, even the sturdy silver tube that is easy to spot in dim light. It's one of the few products I've tried that keeps working all night, so that I wake up without dry skin. My skin has improved dramatically in the last three weeks since I started using IRR, but that is probably due to the non-ablative laser treatment I had a couple of weeks ago. It may take me another month to decide whether this is a product I'll want to keep using, and that $130 pricetag is something of a deterrent, as reflected in a one-star deduction. If the choice were between a few tubes of this and a laser treatment, I know where I'd put my money.

IRR is not a miracle worker, and you're not going to wake up after a week looking 21, unless you happened to be 21 when you went to bed. But it's an effective moisturizer that hits a lot of the right notes in face care.",1
"Both my wife and I tried this lovely ""Crme"" and we were very impressed. It goes on easily and instantly refreshes, feels cool as a cucumber, with no greasy after feel. This is perfect for hot days. It starts with a rather heavy floral scent, we detected citrus and jasmine, maybe other. However, the scent dissipated quickly and didn't bother our noses at all.

It's really refreshing, which is unusual in this sort of ""Crme"" and we liked that.  It also didn't cause any allergic reactions, redness or anything out of the ordinary. Our skin immediately perked to life, and the feeling lasted until morning.

Thus, this would be recommended after a day of to much sun (altho not after a real sun burn of course). Apply immediately after getting out of the shower when getting home, and start revitalizing that sun damaged skin as soon as possible.",1
"This is the second time I've purchased these, hoping that if I followed the directions to a tee, then they would work better. Not so much. They do remove hair (I use them on my bikini area), but really only longer hairs, and only about 25% of what's there. They leave a lot of sticky residue behind, but this comes off easily if you just use baby oil (or the tiny bottle of oil that they come with). I use them now just to get things started, and then have to go behind and either pluck individual hairs (sometimes too cumbersome with the amount that are left behind) or just shave. They DO NOT work on eyebrows or upper lip areas!",0
"This small bottle of skin cream has a retail price of $365.  I am an esthetician and I wanted to try the product.  Before even using it, I checked out the list of ingredients and that raised a question mark in my mind why would this product cost so much when it has 2 types of parabens in it.  Here is the list of ingredients: Water (Aqua), Pentaerythrityl Tetracaprylate/Tetracaprate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Propylene Glycol, C12-20 Acid PEG-8 Ester, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Amaranthus Caudatus Seed Extract, Glycerin, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Glyceryl Stearate, Pisum Sativum (Pea) Extract, Dimethicone, Tribehenin, Glyceryl Linoleate, Leontopodium Alpinum Extract, Artemia Extract, Ursolic Acid, Salicyloyl Phytosphingosine, Sodium Carboxymethyl Beta-Glucan, Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Allantoin, Cetyl Phosphate, Carbomer, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Ceratonia Siliqua Gum, Glyceryl Linolenate, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Oleanolic Acid, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Polyacrylamide, Laureth-7, Triethanolamine, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Citric Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Chlorphenesin, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Fragrance (Parfum), Linalool, Limonene, Coumarin, Geraniol, alpha-Isomethyl Ionone.

As one can see there are so many artificial ingredients in this product, that can make one dizzy.  As excited as I was that this product contains amaranth, artemis flower, rosemary, pea, sage, mango and shea butter it also contains methylparaben and ethylparaben.  For anyone allergic to the fragrance, a note that this product dies contain fragrance.  Product provides a lot of moisture on the skin and it absorbs well without leaving residue.  It is perfect for using underneath the make up.  But the other weakness of this product is that it does not have SPF so one should apply SPF on top of this crme.

Would I buy this product? No.  And it is not just because of the price, but because it contains parabens that are harmful to some people.  I would also not recommend this product to my clients for the exact same reasons.",0
"works pretty good, but something about the brush causes it to make messes real easy.  have to apply very carefully.",1
"looks very fake, threw it away",0
"I didn't realize that this was not a true Wen product until after it was delivered.  Deciding to try the authentic shampoo first with this hair treatment and loved the way the my hair looks and feels!  So I decided to use the hair treatment.  Big difference!  my hair did not feel the same as when just using WEN shampoo nor was it as manageable.  Deciding not to use it again when I washed my hair again with WEN, I had more shedding than I have had before I started using WEN or when I just used the shampoo.  I have wasted my money because I will not be using this product again.",0
it left the stain on my nails after removed...,0
very thick and hard to apply,0
This is one of the nicest makeups I have even gotten. Good buildable coverage and blends well for a coverage that looks natural. But the price means I can't use it every day. I do wish it would come down in price a bit so I throw away all my others and just use it.,1
My sister convinced me to buy this after she had been using it for a few weeks.  I have always had extremely sensitive skin and finding a face wash with as little chemicals as possible that still works was a struggle.  The only thing that bothers me about this face wash is the smell it stinks and the moisturizer almost feels like glue when I put it on my face and leaves a sticky feeling afterwards other then that so far t has worked pretty well with my skin.,1
I used to use Pantene deep penetrating conditioner . But after I tried this my hair is really nice . Never going back,1
"Smells nothing like the hair product. Sharp smelling, could see this as a true unisex sent. Strong sandalwood notes and citrus sent.",0
"This shaving cream is one of my favorites, and I use several brands.  All it takes is a little bit to give me enough lather for two or three passes. I've used a badger brush, a boar brush and even a synthetic brush to make the lather. All work great with it.",1
This stuff doesn't remove ANY of my makeup.  Makes me question how effective it really is as a cleanser.,0
Awesome tool!,1
Great!,1
Good for beginners. Enjoying it. 4/5,1
"I am loving this new Leave-On Gel Primer by NuFACE. I have been using my NuFACE Trinity for about 6 months now and have been loving the results I am getting from using the device just 5 minutes a day. You have to use the gel primer before every use. I prefer this new gel primer over the old formula that you had to wipe off with a damp towel after every use. This gel primer is great because I can use my device in the morning, rub in the gel primer and put on my moisturizer and make-up with no added step.

The new gel primer is a lighter formula so I feel like I don't have to use very much prior to each use. I have noticed that if my skin is really dry that it soaks in faster, so it works best if your skin is hydrated/moisturized. It's also important to only put the gel on per treatment area, not to your entire face. This way it won't dry up quickly in areas you are not treating and you don't use up your gel primer as quickly. This 2 oz size is also the best size to bring with you for traveling.

The active ingredient in this gel primer is hyaluronic acid which is my new favorite ingredient that I have been searching for in all my skin care products. My skin feels softer and smoother after the first application of this gel primer and I think it must be from the hyaluronic acid. Sometimes I just use this gel primer as a gel moisturizer underneath my regular moisturizer for an added boost when my skin is dry and don't even use my NuFACE device.

I will definitely be buying the 10 oz size next once this tube runs out! Love it!",1
"Wasn't happy with product. Too creamy, too pale. Did not last alll day. Way overpriced.",0
"I am using this concealer for 2-3 years now and the best thing I like about it is how easy you can apply it. it also has a very nice coverage. not only I use it as part of my routine makeup but sometimes, I just use it to get rid of the tired look that the dark circles give me without anything else on my face.",1
"Silly me to think that  unscented sun screen means it won't smell like regular sun screen. As I don't like the sun screen smell, I decided not to use it for my face, instead I use it as my body sun screen.",0
"Very expensive and not only FLATTENED out my curls but made it incredibly frizzy. 20 bucks too, what a waste.",0
very good product,1
"This may work for some, but it didn't work for me (I have thick blond hair).  I didn't notice any difference.",0
"I had previously reviewed this product giving it 5 stars as the best dryer I have ever used. Yes it's a great dryer - except that one year later, I switched it on and a HORRIBLE smell of burning starting coming from it. Obviously I can't use it anymore and decided to call the manufacturer to ask for a replacement since it's under warranty. First of all, I contacted them by email and of course no one responded. Then I called - ended up on hold for almost 45 minutes; then they tell me I need to ship back the dryer to their warehouse (which would cost me about 20$ -- when the thing itself cost 35$) if I wanted a replacement! The customer service rep was rude and completely unhelpful. I'm going to throw this one out and buy a different brand for sure.",0
Great service.  Great experience,1
"Great color! Goes on smooth, dries quickly and chips much less than similar brands!",1
"The texture of the oil was very nice but I had to return it as I was too sensitive to the strong herbal smell it left behind that lingered all day.  Usually I love the scent of Nuxe's products but this one was very unique, in a bad way.",0
"Extremely disappointed.  I've used this color for years, but I received a horribly defective product this time around.  It was all clumpy and streaky and chipped in a couple of days.  This was my favorite nail polish, now I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",0
"I like this highlighter. Its a bit dry, but if I use a moisturizer or wet foundation underneath its fine. The highlighter works awesome.",1
I love the balm,1
"Color is beautiful but product was gooey, hard to apply and may have been old.",0
Cleans and shines without stripping the hair - leaves your hair full of body and soft to the touch,1
awesome,1
I may just be stupid but I can curl my hair fine with a flat iron. I thought I'd get this to add variety to the curls but it does not work. I have watched videos and tried everything. It does not work unless I keep it on my hair for an insane amount of time. Takes a long time to curl and does not get too hot though I burn my fingers often on it. Would not buy again or suggest.,0
"My review of  La Roche-Posay Pigmentclar made me feel like I had fallen down the well to NEVER NEVER LAND.  I chose this product for one reason and that reason only.  That reason was for what the package says on the front of the box.  Daily dark spot correcting moisturizer and under that it says, Dark spots, skin discolorations, dull & uneven complexion.  I am now half-way down the well for Ive turned the box over to the backside and it says, Helps prevent sunburn;  if used as directed with other sun protection measures.(see directions:  decreases the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun.

But that is not the reason I chose PIGMENTCLAR.  I chose it for the wordage on dark spots on skin and this is not listed as the choice reason for buying this product.  I do not lie, sit, play or swim in the sun so I don't think I can give an accurate review of what it does for the user as I won't be able to use it for the uses given.  However, the product is probably great as it is part of the Loreal Group which is the largest manufacturer of beauty and health products.  And, its been around 40 years according to GOOGLE.  So it must be useful and safe . Just not for me.  And that is the only reason I gave it one star.",0
Product was open and I didn't feel comfortable using it because I was confident about what was really in it,0
Great !,1
"I got the set in a timely manner but the apricot cleanser is missing. Not open, or damaged, just not there at all. Really disappointed since this is my first time trying epicurens face products.",0
Wife likes it.,1
perfect!,1
"I use nothing but Micellar water to cleanse my face, ever since I discovered it. My complexion has never looked better! This foaming cleanser really foams up a lot with just a little product. It has a light scent and makes my skin clean/soft. La Roche-Posay is a wonderful skin care brand too. My reason for four stars? One of the big advantages of using Micellar water is the convenience of wiping it over my face-no rinsing. This does have to be rinsed and you'll want to rinse it. Five stars for the cleanser, but four stars for having to rinse.",1
"Perhaps it's just my skin type, but this does not work at all for me. It does not shrink a blemish as I thought it might; I have even used it for days to help get rid of a blemish and it does nothing for me.",0
"I feel like this product dries out my scalp.

It makes my hair nice and clean and soft but shortly after I feel like my scalp is itchy. This does not happen with any other product",0
"This product smells really bad. It will take a few uses and other products to get used to/cover up the scent. Also, if you want something that will curl or make your hair wavy, this is not even that useful. I give Twirl Around 2 stars because I honestly wish that I saved my money and just bought what I normally use (which is Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Curl Define & Hold Creme Tropical Mystique. It works wayyyy better than Twirl Around).",0
"bought as a new but came to me as used product in a very suspicious package, dissapointment",0
I did not see much results unlike from other products of CellexC,0
"This creates little tubes around your lashes, which it does, but it does not particularly enhance the look of my top lashes. I used another CG mascara over it because you really could not even see my lashes with it on. It did do better on the lower lashes though.",0
This product is pretty heavy and greasy. It works pretty well; just don't use very much.,0
"This is called a ""highlighter"" I have medium to fair skin, It was too dark, not returning it just using it for around my jawbone but dissapointed",0
"I've been using for about a month now- no difference, my skin is still dry and still looks dull. I've used this along with the Korres cleanser and the moisturizer. The serum smells nice and that's about it.",0
"Loved the scent! Fresh, sophisticated, unusual",1
"I thought I might as well try this product because the reviews looked good and it was only $20. I have no idea what the top review is talking about I smell no citrus at all, this is by far the worst cologne I have ever bought. It is headache inducing even in small amounts and the smell is not great either I don't know how to describe it clearly but it does not smell good at all. Honestly axe and old spice body sprays smell better than this, which says a lot about this product because those sprays are subpar at best.",0
"It's a different substance than what I get from my hairdresser. It's hard and sticky, not soft and waxy.",0
I am a regular user of la roche posay and this is a better product that the hydraphase serum. This is more moisturising and felt very comfortable on my sensitive skin,1
"My husband found the resulting shave to be very easy and smooth, with a  far superior result than he gets from his conventional  shaving foam. His skin felt very smooth and soft.  The  fragrance is subtle and not overwhelming and is very definitely Bulgarian Lavender ( I have a flight of Aromatherapy Lavender essential oils for comparison). While lavender oils are not the most expensive  oils the quality of the product does justify the cost.  This is a really nice product and would be a perfect gift  for a special occasion or a good personal care item.  My husband said it took very little product  to get a great shave. The set we received is the full size product and it should last a long time which makes it more affordable than we initially assumed. This is also a very good unisex product quite suitable for legs etc.  update June 2017, my spouse asked me to reorder the shaving cream because he is almost out of the original jar we got over 2 years ago, still the most comfortable shave ever and one jar lasted over 2years the cost for the cream is about what he was spending on foam shave  cream every other month.",1
"Shampoo doesnt smell bad BUT holy cow the conditioner smells like cat pee, not kidding.  Now I have wash/condition again due to the smell.",0
"Item I received was not the picture, but a different packaging.  If a company provides a photograph, of the item for sale, it should be EXACTLY like the photo it entails.",0
Works very well but stopped heating up after only one month!! I also can't replace it return it.,0
I apply it every day. Lasts a long time!!  Great for my skin!  I am on my second order--will continue to always use!,1
"I put this on what appeared to be the beginnings of 2 different cystic zits. It had zero effect. They progressed like normal into giant hard cysts under my skin. It's been a week and a half, and I'm still using this in conjunction with the drying lotion every day just in case it may shorten the duration. But they have not even remotely changed in size. My cysts typically last 3 weeks, and it looks like these are headed in the same direction. Except now, with the use of this product, the skin is dry and flaky - making them even more noticable. I don't think this kind of acne responds to drying agents (which is all this appears to be - smells like rubbing alcohol), so I'm not sure Mario Badescu's use of the term ""cyst"" is actually for real adult-onset cystic acne. The only thing that has ever worked for my cystic acne is antibiotics. But I don't want to take antibiotics, so.... I continue the search for something else that can help.",0
I bought this for my husband and BOY! does he smell wonderful. This is not a common scent and does not smell like the average cologne. he has been given many compliments. His #1 fan also loves it. buying another bottle for his anniversary gift. :) !!!,1
my son did not like this at all. mad his face very red.,0
"I used this product religiously for about two months and actually lost appearance of hair growth.  Previously I alternated between 5% Minoxidil for women and 10% for men.  I was able to maintain hair growth at the temples of my hair line.  Then I found Revivogen online and thought I would get better results taking the supplements along with the topical but it ended up being worse.  Instead I lost hair growth that I had gained with Minoxidil.
Didn't work at all for me, and it was expensive too.",0
Smells too much like cleaning products.,0
"Hard to understand the rave reviews for this product.  I have thick, curly, rather frizzy hair.  This cream does help with the frizz but it's quite drying.  It isn't greasy but I didn't find it alt all moisturizing, either.  After using the cream with the Love conditioner for two weeks my hair was like straw.  It is dry anyway but the Davine products made the dryness worse.  Both products have an unnatural scent and are full of weird chemicals.  The label reads: ""With almond extract from Mr. Assenza's farm, Syracusa, Italy.""  That doesn't make the Davine line natural. Many hair care products contain some almond oil, and it doesn't matter where the almonds are grown.  Nearly every other ingredient listed on the curl enhancer cream is some five-syllable chemical.  The Love conditioner irritates my eyes badly after I rinse it, which cannot be good for me.  i bought the Davine products during a moment of weakness on a bad hair day and regret the $65.00 I dropped on them.  I might use them once in a while or just throw them both out.  It's back to John Masters--which really is a natural line.",0
"I have used a ton of similar products and while this is more expensive than my typical brands, there are some valid reasons why it might be worth it.

To me this works excellently on my hair. It leaves it styled but very natural looking with no shine, no wet look, etc. But you also have to use it to go where your hair is comfortable going. This is not strong enough to fight your hair's desires like some products do. It merely quietly pushes your hair where it wants to go. Now because of the texture aspect, it is ""stronger"" or more forceful than the V76 by Vaughn Molding Paste that I will review later. That is more like cold cream, where this is more like nearly dry mud in your hands.

They both have the same strong scent/smell. To me it reminds me of a old school barbershop and is very masculine. There is no fruit or floral notes to it at all! That scent is a big reason why this is still 4 stars at the price point. (I like the scent and it makes the product feel more high end to me).

If you are looking for similar products that are a different scent but less expensive look into American Crew Fiber, TIGI Bed Head Matte Separation or even Dove's version is decent.

Now while I enjoyed the scent and the product, because of the cost I will likely be using American Crew or Bed Head in the future for half the cost.",1
"The cleansing brush replaced a much much cheaper one my wife had been using for over a year.  She said without hesitation how much better this was compared to what she was using.  As others have noted, you can take this in the shower - can't be submerged, however.  Feels very gentle, but also strong and the motor doesn't hesitate.  I honestly can't comment about the price point - what do cleansing brushes of this caliber sell for by other companies? - but I do know the wife was pleased and felt this did an excellent job.",1
I got this after I saw good reviews and I'm disappointed. It didn't smell so good and it was so liquidy and when squeezed the oils were separated. It was like it has gone bad. I don't think that's how it's supposed to be.,0
"Although this product may work fine for others, it didn't work at all for me. I used it for 30 days with no result (along with the pre-rinse).",0
"This is a great product, I have been using it for about two years. But.... this time It came in a different presentation: different bottle and also the consistency of the serum is more liquid (like water). Don't like it that much because it is easily wasted, but I still going to use it.. I hope it works well as the old one!",1
"After using the product for several years the company has changed the shape of the can.  After the change,  it seems you only get to use half of the product then the spray nozzle stops working.  Thought it was just the one can but this issue has continued  to the next few cans.  Called Rusk customer service at 18003266247 and they advised ""they don't warranty the product.....sorry we will not help you.""  The place of purchased advised they cannot help either since I used half of the product",0
"I love the Box and all the samples and I thought it was a very good deal as well. If I could change a few things it would be less foil sample. I and many others hardly will use. Maybe less foil samples and maybe a few more small samples in there place. And I loved the box but I would really love to reuse and just like many subscription box's I wish there wasn't any name on the outside of the Box and maybe just on the info card inside. Other then that great deal and would love if Amazon made a surprise box with makeup, a box for hair and one for skincare or combine. Ohh and a candle subscription surprise box while your at it.",1
Great!,1
"it simply does the job. Great taste, cleans, and fresh breath. This is  my go to toothpaste. It is also priced to go.",1
This does not seem like the product my hairdresser uses. My hair does not feel clean and does not leave it manageable. Disappointed I waited too long to send back for a refund.,0
Do not buy this  I was looking around for the curler and it looked like a good deal so I bought it and I was curling my hair and it burn right off,0
"Honestly don't understand mists.  I have super, super oily skin.  As in, I have to wipe/pat oil off after 1 hour.  As in, I can squeeze oil out of my pores.  So, I was intrigued by the zinc in this and the reviews stating that it helped to mattify skin.  It did not.  Also, this is a spray, not a mist.  I've used mists and they really do mist lightly on the face.  This sprays on your face leaving a very noticeable wet mark that you have to rub or spread out.",0
"I have been using this serum since 2005, when a dermatologist in Southern California recommended it to me and sold it to me in his office with his own name on the label (as if he had invented it - ha!) for $130. Fortunately, I looked up the product name online and found it for half that price and even less. I have been buying it online from various sellers ever since.

I have used all strengths of the product and found each one to be very effective. My usual preference is the 10x, and I have normal skin. Even though the 10x (maximum strength) can be drying if I overdo it, as long as I use a moisturizer after applying it, it's great. With the 10x, using less is better for my skin--and because I only use half a pump each day, it lasts a lot longer than the 5x. So I might only have to replace it every 8-10 months. That's just a few bucks a month to ditch the wrinkles, if you do the math. :)

I have an extremely fair complexion, so I have to be careful to apply it without build-up or unevenness, as the product has a slight beige color to it. I put a little across the wrinkles on my forehead, around my mouth, on the bridge of my nose, and under my eyes. Any leftover residue on my hands goes on my neck.

It makes a big difference in how firm and smooth my face looks after just a couple days. .",1
"I have ordered this before with no problem,. this time it was obviously a diluted form of the wash.  it was cloudy and had no seal",0
Great mascara!,1
This stuff works well just like it says and it has an nice eucalyptus smell to it as well.  Word 21.,1
"Terrible product - I got multiple whiteheads breakouts from it. One of the ingredients in it is carnauba wax - it clogs pores, or something else in it that is bad for skin. Unfortunately juice beauty doesn't care about its customers enough to accept returns of unusable product.",0
"Like what it does to my hair, not too dry and I like the scent.",1
"Works well enough, but not as good as other users were claiming.",1
"The  picture for a deep pore cleaner brush head looks like its green bristles, but they are blue. This arrived with NO sanitary packaging at all. The brush head looked used. There was no sterile packaging around the brush head. Shame on this company for selling an un-sanitary personal care product. The brush head went on fine, but I think that it is really just a sensitive brush head substitute. I am very disappointed and I will buy directly from Clarisonic-this brush goes on you FACE. Also I received a strange gray plastic zip bag-was this to make the shipping and handling cost more Why the make up bag? Do not buy from this seller. Beware",0
"Leaves you hair tangle free and smelling good, highly recommend.",1
Good natural face wash for combination skin! Smells like grapefruit!,1
"This is a great curling iron for the price. My hair doesn't hold curl very well, but this gets hot enough that my curls will stay in for 2 days (although they are much looser the second day).",1
Cheap nail polish. Not sure if this nail polish set was old but had a bad smell and didn't go one very nice.,0
"wrong size, my fault",0
lotion smells too loud.,0
not as good for my skin as i expected,0
Does wonders for my sister's extremely dry heels,1
"This product is amazing. My skin color match is a 60W, so it's a little dark for me, but WOW. The product goes on smoothly and covers flawlessly. It makes me look like I have glowing skin and feels luxurious. It's a little heavy, but that's what I expected, given the description. I love that this company makes such varied tones and shades for darker skin.",1
"Its not like how a tested in the stores, absolutely not lasting long, odor vaporizes and goes away quickly and i have to use it over and over or use another parfume. sorry for saying that but even sorrier about what i purchased!",0
Great idea but pretty harsh on my skin.,0
It was a gift for my brother in law and He loved it.  I received it before I even expected it.,1
"The product is great - not greasy at all, gives a nice bit of tint/sheen when you put it on.  I've been using it in place of BB cream on days I don't want to wear a lot of makeup.  SPF seems to be working great.  Minus one star because the packaging was damaged and the product leaks into the cap when I pack it in a bag or my purse.  But overall great product.",1
I bought this product because I have intolerant dehydrated skin. It didn't break me out so thats good BUT I used it 2-3 times today and my skin feels even more dehydrated (just a little more) than usual. I have only used it today so I will update after further use if there is a change :(,0
It is good and soft .,1
"I received a sample of this from Birchbox.  I bought it for my outdoor shower. I loved the smell, almondy,  but this one did not smell like the original. It smelled a little chemical.  Expensive and not a great smell",0
I like t amazing clean smell,1
"Ordinarily I'm a big fan of the Strivectin line of products.  And so far I have seen very good results after using the Deep Wrinkle Serum, & Stretch Mark Cream.  However, I had an allergic reaction to the Eye Concentrate.  I felt a burning sensation around my eyes immediately after applying it.  So I discontinued use of it.  But I would recommend the other 2 products.  I usually follow application with my own preferred moisturizer.",1
"After 1 month of using this iron, it stopped working completely. Complete waste of money! Believe al negative reviews! Fake product!",0
Love this razor perfect for a beginner.,1
I really loved this product! My skin get so much better since I started to use it.,1
"It is a very, very dark shade. Looks nothing like the photo.",0
Chipped badly after 2 days.,0
"After trying this soap I found it lacking. While it made an adequate lather, it dried out very quickly and gunked up my razor something awful. I've been using Pyrates Cove soaps for years and find them far superior to the Proraso. Understand that I'm not making a blanket condemnation of the product. In my most humble opinion the Pyrates Coves soaps are by far more friendly to my face and at a more reasonable price.",0
"I love this product! I have very short hair and it's baby fine. Just a little dab of this gum worked through my hair when damp or dry gives it the manageability and body that I was looking for. It sells for twice this price at my salon, this is a great deal on Amazon!",1
"I've been using this cream for almost a month now. The ""Anti-Aging Need"" in the description states for Post-Menopausal Aging. Since I've been post menopausal for over 20 years now I think I qualify. :-)  (Why do they show young women on ads for older women's products?)

Even though this jar only holds 1.69oz. it does last a long time because I only use a dab at a time and spread it around my face. It's a thick silky cream that is not at all sticky or greasy, absorbs into the skin, and has a pleasant mild scent (to me it could have more scent). I've probably used less than half the jar so far. I had another Vichy product that I really liked that was a lot more floral scented.

So, does it help plump the appearance of my wrinkles? Not that I can tell, at least not so far. Does it provide hydration? I'd say yes. Is it worth the price? To me, no, but I have never been one to wear much makeup or worry about wrinkles (I earned them, after all). I do like the feel of the cream on my face and I feel like I'm pampering myself when I use it.",1
I love this product! Takes off every drop of makeup and doesn't leave your face dry or greezzzzyyy,1
"Makes my hair flat and greasy looking.
Please don't make the mistake I did in not checking on this sellers return policy for this pricey product.
Very unfortunately, products are NOT returnable under any circumstances",0
Excellent product. Thanks.,1
"Be careful with shipping, my bottle came broken. The shampoo itself doesn't lather very well, but works best if you part your hair down the center and work in small sections at the scalp and add water a little at a time to emulsify.",0
"The product I received is definitely not the real Paul Mitchell ""The Detangler."" It has a terrible odor and does not work like the authentic item.",0
"I have super fine hair, and this is one of the few hairsprays that will hold without weighing down my hair. My mother has the same problem, and she swears by this product, too.",1
I thought what the heck could water do to help my dry skin heal? Water?  Yep it works wonders and it's cooling.  I was given this by my Dermatologist. I have ultra sensitive NORDIC skin and it's dry.  This makes you feel so relieved.,1
"Recommended by my dermatalogist, I use as a night time treatment.  It absorbs very well and price much less than at doctor's office.",1
"I had read so many positive things about this Volumizing spray, so I spent the money and ordered it.  It is horrible!  I have very full, naturally wavy hair and was hoping for more bounce.  It left my hair feeling like straw!  Zero softness to my hair and totally like wire.  I keep thinking I should try it again but don't want to experience this nasty feeling again.  Would never spend one cent on this let alone the $$ I did spend.",0
Beautiful and good price...,1
"Best cleanser that I have found for my nose, which continues to have blackheads.",1
"Have been shaving with this Proraso soap for several months. I had Van Der Hagen before and bought Proraso hoping it won't irritate skin but didn't notice any difference at all. Van Der Hagen's lather capability and smell were better than of Proraso's but it will do the job anyway. I suspect it is my not yet perfected DE shaving technique but next time I will buy Proraso with sandalwood.

UPDATE: I am finally through this product and recently started shaving with another of Proraso's products. It's a small green 150ml container with menthol scent and being able to compare to it and Van Der Hagen I used in my first shaving experience I can confidently say that it caused me an unpleasant discomfort since I started using this product. It added to problem with sensitive skin I had and irritated it even more. What I have noticed as well is that using this product caused shaving brush that came in Van Der Hagen set to shed more hair because only small shedding was observed when I used Van Der Hagen and Proraso product I mentioned earlier. I don't know if they changed formula for their ""Proraso Ultra-Sensitive Shaving Soap"" or I got fake product but it's unclear how most folks had good experience with it.",0
Love it,1
"First, the color shown here, which looks like a soft apricot, was actually a garish orange: my toes look like I am wearing orange peel! Second, as another reviewer mentioned, the polish goes on streaky, and it was only after much effort, and much time, that I was able to achieve some semblance of coverage.  I have never thrown out a polish, but this one I did. I think I will stick to Opi polishes, they have a better quality overall.  As for this Essie polish: COMPLETE FAIL, I hated it!!",0
Excellent produce.,1
"Love the scent, very summer and citrus. Cute bottle",1
"Didn't seem to help my mild rosacea (at all) plus it caused me to break out on my nose. We are talking full on bulbous pink-white eruptions, the likes of which I haven't seen since 8th grade. For reference, I am now 42. When you have rosacea, the last thing you want to see is more pink marks on your face, no matter what their clinical description might be!  It is a decent moisturizer so I now use it as a hand cream. My hands and nails are in great condition,now, so at least this purchase wasn't a complete cash loss.",0
"Every time I use this product, I end up breaking out.",0
"After reading a lot of reviews about this product, I decided to purchase it to help with bacne and some small bumps. I'm about 3/4 the way through the bottle and it hasn't helped.",0
will send back - this lotion is either old or not from Red Door - I have purchased this lotion in department stores for years and I have never smelled anything this bad.,0
"This curling iron has lasted me 3 years. I really like this brand hot tools and this large barrel is perfect for long hair. I cut my hair to just above my shoulders and still used it to make a wavy, bed head look. After 3 years the heat is still going strong but unfortunately it's begun to rust so I had to retire it. 4 stars because a major downside for me is that it takes a little too long to warm up enough to make the curls stick.",1
After a couple of months of usage the bristles fall out and I have actually had the bristles embed themselves in my fingers like slivers! Ordering a new styler and I am not ordering this item again!,0
"Have used this several times and it did not smooth or repair my dry hair. The smell was also that of a bad hair dye. Would not recommend, especially for how pricey.",0
I'm addicted to this spray and use it daily. It is so refreshing and it works like a toner on my skin. I love it! The small size is perfect for your purse and I keep the larger bottle on hand at home.,1
"I didn't realize until after I requested this product that it's for men. Oops! I got the flora and cassis scent. It's clean but quite noticeably fruity, and so not a scent the guys in my house are into.  My daughters and I like it a lot though.  I deducted a star for the low lather.  I like body wash to lather a good amount, but this behaves more like regular soap.  It rinses well and smells nice and overall I'm happy using it.",1
"This colour is a big mistake for me. There is absolutely no brown undertone, but rather is a very deep and dark blue black.
 I think the description (darkest brown/black)  is highly misleading.
The extremely high shipping rate of $25.00 is the only reason I did not immediately return it.
Of course understandably it is difficult to judge colour online, what with having only the description as a guide.",0
"As someone who loves Rita's work - she really is a magician when it comes to hair coloring and style - I was so excited to try this on my highlighted hair. You're supposed to apply after shampooing and let it soak for 3-5 minutes. I do think it's effective, but compared to other purple shampoos or toning products I've used, this one isn't very concentrated so if you're looking to see a quick and easy fix for brassiness I wouldn't recommend this. It's more useful as a preemptive anti-brass product to maintain salon color. Smells amazing, however!",1
Does not curl long hair at all. Not even a wave that would last more than 5 minutes.,0
"I didn't like the feel of my hair after using this product. The smell was not too good either, my husband said it smelled like childrens bayer aspirin.",0
This product was a waste of money in my opinion. I did not see any improvement in my skin upon using it. I will not buy again and I wouldn't recommend it to people looking for a cure for eczema.,0
"I started using the Glytone facial lotion step 1 (light moisture)along with the Glytone Mild Gel(nondrying) wash and AFIRM 2x at the suggestion of my dermatologist. The combo helps control my VERY oily skin and makes my pores look smaller.

When I ordered off Amazon, I stepped things up to Step 2 in the lotion and AFIRM 3x. I will continue to use these products.",1
This is a favorite of mine! Makes a nice gift to.,1
It is very gentle but left a residue on my skin and clogged my pores.,0
"Each of the products in this kit is called ""Green Apple [respective product]."" You'd kind of expect a product to have the smell of its title -- even with organic ingredients, I expect some sort of resemblance to what it inherently claims in its title.

Unfortunately, none of the five products in this kit smell anything like green apple. If anything, they smell of rose water, which I personally have a huge aversion to. Way too perfume-y. (Now, I am very sensitive to perfumes and fragrances so read this with a grain of salt.)

I tested the products on my hand since I still wanted to know how they felt. Happily, they feel wonderful. Light, non-greasy, and noticeably softening. But, the smell. I had to wash them off immediately and so can't vouch for long-term skin improvements.

I am a huge fan of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juice-Beauty-Blemish-Clearing-Cleanser-6-75-fl-oz/dp/B001F0D11Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Cleanser, 6.75 fl. oz.</a>&nbsp;which has a light citrus scent. Had high hopes this ""age defying"" line from the same brand would offer a similar fresh and natural fruit fragrance. Sadly disappointed.",0
"I'm sure the product is good, but not for my issues.  I have benign growths on back and hoped it would help exfoliate them....  Could be expensive to continue to use, small bottle.",0
good stuff,1
"great sized paddle brush for short hair, super comfortable grippy handle, and its from a great brand too!",1
"I couldn't imagine what would justify the price difference in this grooming set, but they really are different from the regular sets you buy in the local drug store.  In fact, the clippers are so different, they almost got a low review because we were using the wrong; until we figured out how to use them, they wouldn't cut at all. So, directions for how to use the clippers would have been an improvement.  Once you figure out how to use them, they are very sharp and have a lot of control.  They even clipped the toe nails.  However, they are difficult to use at the corners of the nails.  The whole set is classy looking.  Scissors are nice, operate smoothly and have blunt ends so you don't poke yourself. The nail file has two grits, medium and fine. They feel nice in your hands.  The leather case is a tasteful and functional.",1
"I think this might have been a knock-off  Looks the same, but different fragrance that disappeared right away.",0
"The product caused some mild irritation. It would sting upon application and be sensitive to the touch with a little redness. It was minor enough I tried continuing to use it. There were absolutely no results for me. I think it was because I got the knock off version, my bottle said ""eyelash enhancer"" instead of the ""eyebrow and eyelash"" as depicted in the product photos.",0
"My husband is loving shaving now and his face is much smoother! He's never had a better shave, than before using these products.",1
"Love the smell and it works well. Wish it was a bit bigger, though.",1
"Excellent product!  Saves my hair during styling sessions.  Not sticky like detanglers, not stiff like root lifters or hair spray.  Perfect.",1
In only one month my hair has stopped to fall.  It's easy to use and doesn't take much time. I can't believe the results.,1
"I so want to like this product when I think about how much money I spent on it. But the fact is, this product did absolutely nothing for me. It felt like putting vaseline under my eyes. And it did not give my undereyes any sort of tingling or cooling sensation, which makes me feel like it does nothing. I think this actually made my wrinkles worse and dried the skin out after I cleansed in the morning.

So two stars because for its price it does nothing special. Do not waste your money.",0
good as expected,1
"This lipsticks are beautifully pigmented. The packaging is beautiful, and well made. The formula leaves the lips feeling a bit dry, and if you have overly textured lips this may be a very unforgiving formula. It does not feather much alone.  Now I will talk about each of the two shades I have. They have a sweet vanilla scent that is wonderful.
4/5 stars for this formula

Dominatrix: This is a very beautiful deep wine shade. It is flattering on my fair skin. Still has that drying formula quality.
4/5 stars for this shade

Socialite: This is a very nude shade. It is a bit too nude/light on my fair skin. However, I like to use it for an ombr lip. Using it in the center and blending out. Looks gorgeous. Still has a drying formula, but is a bit more smooth on the lips.
3.5/5 stars for this shade

Picture 1: Swatches of the shades
Picture 2: Dominatrix on the lips in a picture (paired with a bit of the matching gloss for more moisture)",1
"My only complaint is that they seemed just a little bit more abrasive than the heads that came with my PMD device. But from now on I will simply use less pressure.
I would definitely order these again. Just wish I didn't have to continually order them....",1
Works well but dries my hair out a little. I follow up with  conditioner and coconut oil and it seems to be fine,1
I asked a woman in an elevator what perfume she was wearing.  Then I bought some for myself!!,1
"I've used this shampoo for 12 years. Some places have charged me up to $40 for a bottle. I never complained because it is highly concentrated and lasts me for 5-6 months, as I use just a quarter-sized dollop. That amount is very sufficient for my medium-short hair.
This price, however, is impossible to beat. I looked around, and that is my new go-to for my Nioxin. I want to support my local stores but they charge more, and didn't have the #3 for fine/treated hair. Sarn!
I did patronized my local Bi-mart and bought a small bottle, and I will use the large bottle as the ""mother ship"" to fill the small  one for easier handling in the shower.",1
"this did nothing for my bacne, and it smelled terrible--like cheap dish soap.",0
Still saw very dark wrinkles under my eyes after weeks of use.,0
"This just gives a nice neutral color for when you want your nails done, but not in a bold color. I use a coat of Romantique on top and the shimmer shows thru.",1
Met all expectations!,1
"Malibu used to make EC Mode.  However, they've discontinued that line.  This product is what Malibu recommended as a replacement.  I have really hard water that tends to turn my blonde hair a little brassy.  Yes, I color my hair.  This does work really well to get the hard water build-up out and remove that brassy tone.  I also have naturally curly hair.  It didn't weigh my curls down.  My hair is also dry.  Not damaged, just dry.  This didn't provide quite enough moisture to use as a daily shampoo and conditioner.  I think this will be a set that I use about once a week to get the gunk out.  I'll stick with my more moisturizing shampoo and conditioner the rest of the month.  I think it would work great as a daily shampoo and conditioner for someone with more normal or oily hair.  The weekly treatment is also great.  But with my hair being dry, I think I'll stick with using it once every two weeks.",1
Arrived on time and works great,1
The product I was sold was out of date.,0
I favor masculine smells. This meets my standards and smells good while leaving my face happy. I have made this into my travel shaving soap. Its really more a cream than a soap. The dish it comes in is made of plastic so no worries on throwing it in my travel bag.,1
"initiially, the item worked wonderfully!!  I LOVED this iron.... Then one day, after approximately 2 1/2 months it just stopped getting hot.  I made sure it was plugged in to a working outlet and was turned ON - but nothing....wouldnt even get warm.  The orange ""ON""  indicator light was illuminated and i even tried different temperature setings....still nothing.  Debating on whether or not to buy the exact same or switch to a different brand :/",0
"I have long, curly hair all the way to my waist and I was looking for something to give me beachy waves that a 1"" curler does not. I guess I can't say that it is a bad curler but it definitely does not make curls, it simply straightens hair and makes it curl out or in at the bottom. I switched to the 1.5 inch, however, and it worked exactly how I wanted to. This one was just TOO big!",0
Good color but more pink than I would have liked. Very pearly light pink. Still wore it and it was fine.,1
"This is junk - wish I could return.  I have used many Jan Marini products through the years and this is not typical Jan Marini quality, feels like your face is slimed after using.  Wish I could return, total waste of money.",0
I've tried many benzoyl peroxide washes and I've never been too impressed with the different textures. This face wash is gentle and has a great texture. I've suffered from acne most of my adult life and it took me nearly 10 years to find a decent face wash that actually works. I'm currently using two face creams prescribed by my dermatologist and this face wash works well with them. I definitely recommend for anyone who is in search of a benzoyl peroxide face wash that doesn't irritate your skin!,1
This is a very good concealer and feels great too - very smooth & blendable. I am used to concealer in a tube so still getting used to this type of concealer but overall like. I really love glo mineral products!,1
"Although I thought I was buying a professional flat iron, and IT IS a Rusk, the cable to plug IT IS a disgrace as IT IS thin and fragile. The Rusk products I have purchased before have sturdy cords. Additionally, I am not fully satisfied with the heat the the iron provides. Certainly not what I thought I was buying.",0
Cannot compare to eff ctven as of Latisse.,0
My daughter is so thrilled to finally have a really good flatiron. This one was a perfect choice both cost- and performance-wise.,1
This is the best dry shampoo on the market. My blonde hair is sensitive to product and it always works like a charm. Other dry shampoos leave my hair feeling oilier and weighed down but this is the BEST by far. Dont waste your money on ten different cheap dry shampoos.,1
I've never been so disappointed with Amazon. I purchased this box as a gift and was too embarrassed to give it away. The samples looked like they were thrown together and like everyone else stated there were even a few male colognes included. The samples were cheap looking and small. This was not worth the $20. Save your money!!,0
"Im in my mid 50s and this is the decade where my neck is starting to get saggy and crepey. This Strivectin Tightening Neck Serum Roller is tailored to the neck-which is cool as I focus so much on the skin on my face but haven't really done anything special for my neck. Aside from containing chemicals like BHT, this is a serum I enjoy and Ill finish the entire tube (and buy it if I think the benefits outweigh the chemicals). I love the delivery of the serum in the tube through a metal roller top. It keeps the product fresh and also feels refreshing rolling it over my clean skin. I work it in with my fingertips and apply my favorite firming face cream to my neck afterwards.

I have sensitive skin and haven't experienced any irritation, and I find the fragrance so mild I wish Strivectin would leave it out as its just one more unnecessary chemical.  I cant claim an overnight miracle, but I do get an instant benefit as the skin on my neck definitely feels softer and firmer.  It also looks a little more taut and less crepey.  Im looking forward to finishing this tube (which looks like it could take a few months) to see what long range benefits it provides (if any) and will update if I see a more dramatic result. So far I really like this Strivectin serum, though Im taking off one star for chemicals like BHT and fragrance. 4 stars.",1
"For the first few weeks or so of using this product, I was really pleased with the results. After a while, it left so much build-up on everything I used... My flat iron had a disgusting brown film around the edges and even my hair started feeling dirty... I would only use a dime sized amount and I have long hair. Even washing my hair a few times wouldn't get it as clean as it should have been. Needless to say, I've stopped using this product.",0
"I just got this in the mail today.  Disappointed - it doesn't close all the way, therefore, it doesn't do anything to the hair.  I just tried to straighten my daughter's hair and nothing!  I guess I got a reject and need to return it or exchange it.",0
OK,1
Works really well. Dries my hair much faster. Only problem is that it is a bit on the heavy side.,1
"This is AWESOME! It definitely does everything it claims to do! Definitely tamed any frizz I had, and after spraying it in my hair, I could literally run my fingers through without it getting caught at all, it INSTANTLY detangled. The smell is very strong, but once your hair dries it fades a bit. I got a sample in a Birchbox and that's exactly why I love Birchbox because I get to try things that might end up working for me, this definately being one!!!",1
I have used before.  It helps with thinning hair.,1
"Omg! I cannot say enough about this product. (Despite the price)! So i first came in contact with this facial cleanser well on my bachelorette party in Miami. I was functioning on 4 hours of sleep the whole weekend. It was such a blast! However my face was starting to reap the consequences. I have really to dry skin. I cannot use products like Neutrogena or Clearasil. My skin is so sensitive and I will break out if I even touch my face with my hands, which I avoid at all costs. So I'm somewhat used to paying high dollar for my skin care because my face is so complicated. The first night I tried this, I paired it with the Sunday Riley Luna oil. When I woke up my complexion was so pretty, and that almost never happens. I have large pores that get clogged quite often. I also experienced redness. This product fixed all for me. I quit buying it for 2 months due to the price and I tried Rodan & Fields. They have good products too however nothing compares to what Sunday Riley did for my skin. I just we purchase this and received it in the mail and cannot wait to start using it again.",1
"I have purchased and used this product multiple times, and know what I should be getting, yet this time I got a 2/3 full bottle with no lid and therefore no tamper seal. I love this shampoo, but I'm not touching this bottle and I'm thoroughly irritated that I paid full price for an obviously used product. Disgusting.",0
Disappointing..,0
I would definitely recommend this package as I felt that the Flat iron and its accessories were appropriately priced. I also didn't have to wait long for the product and was able to use it glitch free.,1
This stuff smells so nice and locks in moisture after I put makeup on my face. I feel flawless when I use it. And it smells good. :),1
"I should have read this before trying StreVectin. I used its intensive repair and its eye cream at night. The next morning, I used both again. And my face felt like exposing in a desert for the whole day. As I checked my face in the mirror, it was abnormally red. My face felt itchy too. I bought the eye cream to moisturize my eye skin, but found for the first time in my life fine lines under my eyes after using it! Now I DO have an eye skin problem!
My case might be an exception since I have sensitive skin. Warnings to those who have thin and sensitive skin!",0
holds color in reasonably well but leaves my hair a bit oily and have to wash it more often which kind of defeats the purpose.  I find Shimmerlights does not leave my hair do this and protects the color as well.,0
strange product  - but not color payoff. No stay on pawer. Use it as a moisturizer for lips?,0
this so good products because it works so good,1
My shaves using this product are somewhat of a disappointment.  Difficult to work up a lather and somewhat messy unless you use a brush which then creates extreme stress on the brush due to hardness of the cream.  In my opinion product is also overpriced.,0
"I don't have porcelain skin and I don't have olive skin, I have medium skin. So when I ordered a medium concealer I expected to receive something for medium skin. This is actually better for someone between porcelain and medium. It's far, far too light for my skin tone and ends up making my under eyes and chin look weird when I use it.

I also don't like how oily/creamy it feels. It's just too ""slippery"" for my taste and I'd rather see something that stays put rather than slides around.

Not much of me wants to continue using the product.",0
Great product!  It absorbs and dries quickly.  I found it's best applied with a makeup sponge.  Would buy again.,1
WOW what a great product! I have thick long hair and I think I've shortened my morning routine by 10 mins!,1
This color lock system and fast drying drops really work! A+,1
Works as described. Great product.,1
"When I open it, It's full of alcohol smell. I don't like it make my skin pricking, but I still stick to have used it for one week. I was disappointed and gave up because it totally  doesn't work for me!",0
leaves your hair more ratty than before you washed it. Took many weeks to be delivered. Won't be buying again.,0
"I have used Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Shampoo for 10-15 years and I loved it, but it appears Paul Mitchell has changed the ingredients.  I resently purchased a new bottle and now I am having an allergic reaction.  My scalp burns, itches and has red spots.  I don't have an old bottle to compare ingredients, but I noticed some of the new bottles advertise ""white ginger"" and this new bottle's ingredients does show ""white ginger.""  I honestly do not know what has changed, but I can't use it any more.  Why do they have to mess up a good product?",0
Really light effect.  This only gets rid of the puffiness.,0
"I have short hair & thought this would work-did very little to get rid of the curl & believe me my hair is not really curly except on the ends-bangs, & side-very disappointed.

Leaves a white residue. Look like a grandpa,0
Stopped working a few months later,0
It wasn't advertised that it wouldn't be compatible in NZ.  It just burnt out after 5 minutes!  I would love a version suitable for NZ.,0
It leaves my face solf &  youthful looking!  The best.,1
this item is a FAKE with a completely different smell and consistency than the real product from the salon. annoyed and disgusted.,0
This product was delivered to me unsealed and open . Very hesitant about using this product because Im not sure if it was previously used or if the product was switched out .,0
"Color is gorgeous, I add two coats to make it a little brighter!",1
does not blend - I bought based on reviews and it does not work on me the same as some of reviewers.  Disappointed.,0
I love this stuff. It's a great sunscreen and a great matte make up primer. I'm obsessed with how cheap it is compared to similar products. It also doesn't stink and isn't messy like other similar products. I would definitely recommend this stuff!,1
"The brushes I received do not fit into my Clarisonic. I don't think there is much more to say.

Not Recommended. prisrob 06-04-13",0
Texturizing spray gives thin hair a boost.,1
Good product,1
"Exactly what I wanted:  all one piece, clean, effective and great for the purse/travel.",1
Nothing special. Found this product harsh on color treated hair.,0
"I like this sunscreen, I'm not sure how often its supposed to be applied.  Its lightweight and unscented which is great for me.",1
"They must have changed the formula. This is totally diff then what Iv gotten before,Very disapointed.",0
I got a small size of this from Ipsy or Birch box and it was great! So I ordered a big bottle and its HORRIBLE. It makes my hair look even dirtier and greasier after Ive used it! Im throwing away the whole mostly unused bottle. Never again.,0
I bought this iron because I was told it was a great purchase I've tried it several times on my hair and all my daughters hair and a curl never stays no matter what I do to try to keep the curl it falls out within minutes. Spent way too much money on this iron for this type of performance,0
Being such a raved about highlight i was expecting more of an intense glow,1
This is an older bottle and I am not thrilled about that. I wonder if it will work as well.,0
"I agreed to review this product in exchange for recieving the product at no cost, however I have searched extensively for information on whether or not the product contains any animal products and can't find any definitive information on the Obgagi website.  It's not clear that the product is not tested on animals either.  I used the product for a week and have seen absolutely no difference in my skin.",0
"I cannott live without this tea tree soap! It makes a regular shower into a minty refreshing relaxing time! It also keeps my skin soft and clear! This seller cares and gets it right out to you! I love that! :) you should try this yourself! you'lle never want to stop using it! It seems to wash away my stress! It is very invigurating!!! :)
Valerie",1
this does not work with my rosacea.  It made it worse.,0
This balm is nothing like it used to be. I should have heeded the warnings in the other reviews. This balm has no smell or what I consider a bad smell (certainly not sandalwood). The consistency of this balm is also terrible. It's very watery. The old balm smelled great and had a nice thick consistency. Avoid this product.,0
"I was really excited to get these products, but I was sadly disappointed by their results. The products contain denatured alcohol which was very irritating to my skin.",0
I use a lot of retina A and this is soo soothing.  Worth the high price!,1
"Doesn't ""relax fine lines and wrinkles"" nor have I seen any ""strenghtening of the dermis"". Both are claims it makes.  It certainly didn't ""relax facial muscles"" - -another claim that so far as I know only botox CAN do.  So frankly it's basically a lovely feeling serum with some anti-oxidants for a very expensive price.  You and I can do better for the price!",0
Would not reorder,0
"I bought three different colors of this dreamy looking nail polish and used them as stocking stuffers (including my own!)  The sheen is lovely, but the polish chips easily, and can't be worn without a topcoat, as even two coats won't stand up to normal wear and tear for even a day.",0
"I originally LOVED this brush, but unfortunately two months in, it has stopped working. Haven't heard back from the company yet on getting a replacement.",0
"Good for travel, although the brush that comes with this kkit is not nearly as good as the brush I have at home - so basically this is worth it if you simply need the travel sizes of the products for airline travel.",1
I love the scent of the Mustela body lotion and I thought this might be the same. It is not. The scent is very strong at first but fades in a few minutes.,0
"This cream blush just sits on top of the skin and rubs right off as soon as you get close to anything. I thought because of the brand name, it would stain the skin a bit and not just sit there. Not what I am looking for in a blush. You have to keep putting it on all day long.",0
"After a major hair color disaster at the beauty shop, this is a tremendous help.  With trying to fix the color (there was a problem with the new tube of dye, yea me for being the first one that it was used on) I had 6 months of color put on in 4 weeks, which pretty much ruined my hair. I love the feel of this product and it is definitely helping restore the moisture in my hair.  When I mow the yard, I drench my hair in this and let the the 100+ degree heat soak it in.  I will definitely buy again!!!  I love it!!!",1
"If you have oily skin, DO NOT buy this. It leaves my skin shiny, and does not cover anything. It is very thick, and makes my face feel suffocated.",0
The best base coat I've found. Will be ordering again.,1
"nice but color is very faint, perfect if you're going for a natural look",1
It looses heat and damages hair.  Would not buy again!,0
"I fell in love with Blinc products especially the eyeliner. When I saw the Blinc liner pen, I really didn't think I would like it as much as the regular eyeliner product. But I like my liner very thin, so thin, it was a bit of a struggle to get the regular eyeliner as thin as I like it. But leave it to Blinc to come out with this  liner pen....I love it! It stays on all day, I never have to worry about smudges or mascra under my eyes with Blinc.",1
The nail corrector is good for only a couple uses but it works great,1
It's not waterproof at all.,0
Love this product. I have extremely dry skin and this helps especially during the winter. Leaves my face moisturized and soft,1
"My partner and I both have greying, short thick hair. Crude Clay preceded this product and we liked it better but after a short adjustment period we find this to be the best product on the market for giving the tossed-look to short, heavy hair.",1
This was a lot more sheer than I expected. It creased and faded throughout the day much more dramatically than other brands I've used around my eyes. I liked that it was brightening around the eyes but I do not believe it is worth the expense to buy this concealer.,0
"I ordered a BaByliss product on the recommendation of my hairstylist. (FYI, he didn't specifically recommend this one, but suggested I look on Amazon for a ceramic BaByliss iron in this price range.) I had been complaining that my cheap flat iron didn't get my hair straight enough. Thankfully he told me about this brand b/c I was almost to the point of shelling out $100+ for a fancier one.  This iron gets hot quickly and straightens my hair easily. My hair is naturally wavy (not kinky curly, but definitely not straight) and this iron can straighten out my hair from that wavy state pretty easily. It has a removable comb on one side to help smooth/guide your hair through the iron. I've tried both ways and find the comb helpful. For under $30, this is a great iron.",1
"Loved this product at first, but then a lot of the paint started chipping off.  I only had this product for less than 2 months. I would not recommend this curling iron to anyone.",0
"Excellent Hairdryer,  Definitely a good buy, a bit more heavier than most - but packs 2000 watts of drying capability!",1
I've had this for over a year and I love it. I've used a Chi for years and they always broke just as the warranty went out. The Paul Mitchell was a great buy. It keeps my hair straight for 2 days with out having to touch it up.,1
"Im not sure how this powder would show up for others, but I have bleached hair, so its perfect for me. I also think that it works a lot better than dry shampoo sprays, in particular for taking care of oil. The scent is nice too.",1
"Since I am the sort of person who suspects that the difference between facial cleanser products generally comes down to fragrance, color, package, and marketing, I am probably not exactly the target demographic for such ""luxury self-care products"".  Therefore, my criticism of this product may be exactly what makes it appealing to a certain segment of the population.  But, I offer this since I too am tempted from time to time to try various cleansing products, searching for one I like.

The problem with ZIRH CLEAN Face Wash is that you can't use it.  It comes in a rigid metal bottle with a screw-on lid and no pump.  In this configuration, you cannot get at the stuff inside without opening the thing, pouring some soap into your hand (it's quite viscous, so it takes a while), and then closing it back up.  As the bottle gets down to the dregs, this will no doubt become even more frustrating.

If you are the sort of person who is likely to feel that this extra work to get at your soap sets it aside from the $3 squeeze bottle with neon colors that you can get at the corner drug store, then you should buy this.  If you expect at least a modicum of usability, then skip this in favor of something else.  No soap is that great.",0
"Covers gray well, but comes off on my hand.",1
"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my father. It took nearly two weeks to arrive, upon first glance everything was fine. Once the package had been opened the box was damaged on all corners and looked very ""used"" - one week after gifting the product the pump broke off. This was a bad choice of a gift and i wish I'd gone another product. Will not purchase from this seller again, end of story.",0
"This is my second try with this item.  The first one worked great....for about 10 days.  Then it stopped working; would not turn on.  I decided to try another one because when the item worked, it was perfect for my fine, thin hair  The barrel release worked great so my hair slid through without grabbing.  The temperature was not too hot so it didn't burn my hair or any part of my body.  Unfortunately, the barrel release on the new one works intermittently.  Sometimes it works fine, but most of the time, it doesn't work so my hair gets stuck in the bristles. I then have to turn the brush off and carefully release my hair from the brush.  Needless to say, this is not healthy for my hair and increases the time it takes to style.  Sadly, I am going to send this one back too and won't try the item again.  I bought this for the small size of the barrel.  I have an old Revlon hot air brush that works great for creating a smooth style, but the barrel is too large to create more defined curls.  It comes with an additional smaller barrel, but the bristle are different than on the large barrel and grabs my hair mercilessly.  I have read countless reviews of other brands and none of the small barreled items seem to work without pulling on the hair.  I'll keep researching.",0
Easy to use and good results,1
This is not a sheer white like some of the other reviews mentioned. It looks like white-out stuff you use to correct something written in ink.,0
Smells great but price is a too high,1
My fiancee loves this stuff,1
"I have been using this since I had my hair permed (body), and my hair has never been softer and healthier.  The perm has lasted almost 1year as well. Four stars just because of expense (though 1jar lasts 3months at 2-3 times/week).",1
great product,1
it was ok. I am not a big fan of it. I still let my daughter use it so I guess it does the job.,0
"These bad reviews are accurate. My hair started thinning due to a chemical perm. I purchased nioxin 6 and it made my hair fall out in the shower in chunks! I am literally balding and have the pictures to prove it. I am going to stop using this product asap and never purchasing again. Shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel dry, tangled, & looked unhealthy.",0
Its a pretty decent after shave. I would recommend it to anyone looking to add variety to their shave collection. I paired it with a favorite soap and they worked great together. I look forward to more matches with other soaps. Great price for those just starting out in collecting wet shaving supplies.,1
I glad I found this product.  It works so well hiding my bald spots.  I love it.  The only thing is that if I forgot and touch my scalp the fibers would get my nails all black.,1
bought the wrong one! reordered the correct one,0
Best hand cream ever!,1
I have tried this product twice on my daughters cradle cap which is all over her head. I followed the instructions both times both left the product on longer the second time and it literally did NOTHING! It didn't even help a little. Worst waste of money ever!!!!,0
"This is a review of the product not the seller as I purchased this in a spa.  This is my HG product that I've been using for years now.  I have tried to find a liquid spf that won't break me out and haven't been able to, but this Mineral Powder with spf does NOT break me out and for that I'm so thankful!  For reference I am blonde with blue eyes and warm undertones.  The colour Natural is the one I prefer.  This makes my skin look beautiful throughout the day.  A healthy dewy glow without looking oily.  I do have to blot a few times during the day, and if I'm going out, I will re-apply, but it stays put and looks lovely on.  I also love their blush in barely rose.  Just beautiful!",1
"Amazing fragrance
 but hard to apply",1
"Good product , however it had finger prints all over the cream blushes and some eyeshadows !",0
"I use this product, it's great.  However -- this travel size does not work!  took it on a trip, went to use it and NO foaming action at all.  Just sticky liquid.  for the up-price of a small amount i suggest NOT buying from this seller, look elsewhere.",0
"If you are looking at this product as a solution for single dark spots, don't bother.  It will do nothing to fade those individual hyper-pigmentation spots.  If you have more of a blotchy uneven skin tone due to hyper-pigmentation, this might work better for you.",0
"Very slow to ship, good product if you do not mind a long wait",0
"Not too crazy about this eyeliner, it just doesn't apply easily over my eyeshadow, it's like it's a little too hard or something to draw my little dashes over my eyelid.  I've sharpened it, given it a hundred chances and I just don't like it, sorry I can't say something better about it.  I'll stick to my Loreal eye pencil, much easier to use.",0
"I feel that baby powder does a better job than this product. It didn't make my hair look cleaner and like some other reviews, I felt like it weighed my hair down. The scent is too strong for me as well so if you are sensitive to fragrances don't order this.",0
"I did not like at all, made face too pink. Like the old one which was bronze and pink",0
Love love love these. Produces a silk finish.,1
"I bought this based on Amazon reviews and reading the glowing reports of users. I quit gel manis (oh how I loved them ) due to extensive damage it had done to my nails. I had a few dry spots on nailbeds of a couple of nails.

AFTER using the OPI polish remover twice, my nails had MANY dry spots and had actually begun peeling again (I had gotten that damage taken care of with Nail Envy). Fortunately, I bought it locally and returned it for a refund. So disappointed...",0
you have to use a lot if you have thick hair and for the price point it's not worth it. the peppermint essential oils in this are too concentrated and will burn your eyes,0
Its Ok. It did not exfoliate like DCL pads did....not as strong. I couldn't tell much difference with these. Would not reorder.,0
"This is NOT the REAL brand of Moroccan Oil by moroccanoil.com. I wondered what was wrong with it when I opened it... the bottle was oily, the pump didn't work well (and was very cheap feeling), it didn't smooth my hair well or make it shiny (it actually made it fuzzy), and the SMELL was just AWFUL! It also gave me really bad allergies (itchy eyes & skin and sneeze attack all day after putting it on). I have never had that happen with real Moroccan Oil, it is NOTHING like this: it smells lovely and makes your hair feel silky soft and look superb.

Also, something weird is happening. On my Order page for this item is says it was sold by ""in stock novelties llc"" but on the product page it now says ""Sold by JDG Associates and Fulfilled by Amazon."" I am returning this item. I am disappointed in Amazon for continuing to allow this item to sell on here as I see other complaints by other people saying the same thing. This is my first bad experience with 3rd party merchandise bought on Amazon.com. I will look at reviews more carefully next time.",0
Color isn't great- don't like this product as the bronze ad brighten is actually better for me,0
My wife loves it that's all that matters,1
Very bad smell and did nothing to my face!,0
This product is drying.,0
Great coverage!,1
Freshens breath but that's about it.,0
They burn my skin and literally skin starts peeling..,1
Looks nice until it chips off 4 hours later lol,0
"My hair stylist uses this so, I ordered it online and am very pleased - love the scent/",1
"I love this wash. The smell is great (It's not uncommon for me to get compliments from people when I use it) and it lathers up great. A little will go a long way so you don't need to much for body wash when you lather it up with a loofa or wash cloth. The very best part is that the wash leaves your skin very soft and moisturized. I've used other ""moisturizing"" body washes in the past and they never really do the job. The price is good considering you're getting a quality shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in one. Would recommend to any man.",1
Very good quality and properly weight shaver. Only downside is the knob tends to slip to the tension on the blade is temporarily lost.,1
I don't love this as a shampoo. You need a lot to get your hair and scalp clean but it is WONDERFUL as a body wash. Smells divine.,1
have to turn off water and stand there for a few minutes,0
Awesome Mascara product,1
Lasted two and half months being used once a day.,0
"I LOVE Vinylux.  I'm busy, crazy busy.  In an ideal world, I'd be able to get and keep gel manicures on a regular basis.  However, something always seems to come up and prevent me from keeping up with them.  A friend told me about Vinylux, and I've been hooked ever since.

If you use the Sticky Base Coat along with the Vinylux on clean, completely dry nails, it will last you a full week without chipping.  And, if the only time you can spare to tend your nails is at 2am, you won't have to worry about getting to the salon.",1
I can wear this fragrance all day. Always receive compliments.,1
"This is the holy grail lip balm, you guys! I get super chapped lips in the winter, and this has been the only thing to remedy them. And despite it being marketed for men, I'm a woman who uses it. I use the Shea Butter flavor. And from a tip I heard in a youtube makeup guru video, I use a dollop on a cotton swab to buff away the peeling layers of my lips to create a nice surface to apply makeup to. Definitely worth the price.",1
"Very unhappy. I followed the application instructions being careful around eye area and after 3 days of using this product I developed painful styes on both my upper eyelids. I'm currently researching other mineral powder foundations. I will only purchase make up without sun screen ingredients. I believe it was the zinc that clogged my eyelids lubricating ducts. Overall, very disappointed and unhappy. It's unfortunate because I did like the coverage it gave me. I've NEVER had a make up product that gave me Styes. I've NEVER experienced a stye in my life. I'm 45 yrs old. Lesson learned!",0
This really worked for me! I have been having problems with breakouts all over my chin area and tried so many different products to get rid of this.  I used this product for 2 nights and the acne is cleared up completely.  It didn't dry my skin and it absorbed quickly.  I just can't believe this actually worked.  I use it once a day to keep away potential trouble spots.  I am very happy with this product.,1
I have been using this product for about 3 years as it was recommended by my doctor. I am not sure how much it helps my skin though. Amazon had the best price and the shipping was fast.,1
My wife used this cream on her face and hands. She liked it as a good product. This product arrived right on time.,1
Did not help polish stay on longer do not waist your money!,0
Don't see what all the fuss is about. Seems to do nothing for me and I use as directed.,0
messy but it helps a bit,1
"This product is tinted WAY too dark for those with very fair skin. It is like an orange/beige color. I put it on and it looked like I had smeared my face with melted butterscotch chips. Sending it back. I am giving it two stars because it seemed to absorb well into the skin, but it says it is for ""all skin types"" when it is definetely not for very fair skinned people.",0
one of the best cream in the world....you have to try it.,1
This is the WORST flat iron spray I've ever used. It's more like hair spray and it smells way to chemical for my liking.,0
"My favorite scent. I have been using it for years, since it first came out. Woe what a bargain price on Amazon!",1
"This product s expensive and you get a tiny tube - first disappointment. Then it is very difficult to squeeze the product our of the tube.  After I finally got it to work a very large amount squirted out and there is no way to get some of it back into the tube so it was wasted. I probably wasted 1/2 of the gel just trying to squeeze any out.  Very poor packaging and the blonde is too dark - someone with black hair could use it they wanted lighter brows.
At $34.00 I am disappointed with Stilla -  I would have expected a better product, better packaging ,and more product for the money.",0
This stuff is amazing I'm a 29 year old man and a hair dresser .,1
"Mama swears by it, not at it!",1
Had for less than a year and already it's stopped working. After spending over $150 on this iron I expected more.,0
It helps the frizz and calms my hair. I do have to apply it a few times a day. It can be applied on wet hair before blow drying. I recommend this!,1
"Smells a bit too sweet for me, but has a pleasant scent.  Kind feels like a dry shampoo a little bit so is use it to give my unwashed hair a bit of body.  I like it and would repurchase.  Just wish it wasn't quite so sweet smelling.",1
"As hair pomade goes, this is a good one. It smells pleasant and shampoos out. I would've given it a 5, but I wish it were a little cheaper.",1
"I gave the product two stars because my dermotologist recommended it.  However, after the third time I used it.  My eye lids, swoll and took a week to heel.  I assume it's a good product if you are not allergic to it.",0
I love this stuff it.s better then any other leave-in detangling spray I have try. it make's hair feel soft and easy to comb,1
"EltaMD is very good sun protection lotion. I have used it for last one year. this was third order.
very happy with the product.",1
I do not like this product it leaves a residue on you brushes. I had to clean them another way after using this product a few times.,0
"Love Wen, and was surprised to find it available on Amazon.  Would highly recommend this to anyone with fine hair",1
It is pretty good. The result is pretty nature and waterproof. It is one of the favorite eyeliner I ever used.,1
"I thought maybe my hair had changed somehow as it would not curl at all with this iron. It still baffles me how that could happen. I mean, it got super hot, but absolutely no curl. Very disappointing and total waste of money.",0
Beautiful color - goes on very well and lasts too.,1
disappointed it doesn't work on my hair. No texture added at all.,0
It's too heavy for my thing hair,0
I love this product!  My new go to!,1
"Love this iron!  Hairdresser used this iron on me at a salon -- she recommended to be as good as higher end pro models. Heats super fast, adjustable heat levels, and the longer barrel lets me curl my long hair in far fewer passes.  Second size I've purchased of the Hot Tools XL barrel and am extremely satisfied with both.",1
"Very easy to use unlike other waxes that you have to scoop out with your finger. It has a cream-like texture and blends into your hair easily
The hold is very smooth but strong. I usually use it when I'm in a rush and I brush some wax through my hair a few times and I'm good to go.
It has a interesting but sweet smell.
Unlike my other wax that is very stiff and sharp looking, this give my hair a more wavy and smooth look",1
"In my quest for a cruelty-free night cream, this was one of my first choiced.  It got good reviews and seemed like a reasonable price for the amount you receive.  On its arrival, I was happy with the size of the bottle.  On using it the first time, I noted that it went on pleasantly: heavy enough to seem like a night moisturizer, but light enough that it didn't feel like I was wearing Cisco on my face. After two days of using it, my face broke out into a sea of non-red raised bumps.  I admittedly have very sensitive skin, but, ended up dumping the rest of it.",0
"I love Pur Minerals powder foundation and I was excited to try this one hoping for more full coverage for nights out etc.  I didn't really like this foundation and won't be repurchasing.  It is a strange consistency.  I found that the included puff which looks like a powder puff didn't really do a good job of applying the product to my face.  I immediately switched to a foundation stippling brush.  This did a decent job but the product still seemed a bit dry and not very easy to distribute evenly on my face.  Also, I ordered the color, Light, I normally wear the shade Light in my Pur Minerals 4 in 1 powder foundation and it is the perfect color for my fairly pale skin.  This foundation in Light, however, was too dark for me.  I could possibly wear it now that it is summer but the somewhat thick and dry consistency of the product leaves me not wanting use it.  I wore it out a couple of times.  I did not seem to get a good coverage.  By the time I had it applied, I seemed to have spots with a ton of foundation and other areas with not as much.  It just doesn't go on evenly.  Also, it made me feel like I was wearing foundation.  You know the feeling of stage type cream makeup?  Thats the feeling I had with this on.  This is going in the trash and I'm going back to my powder mineral foundation.",0
Terrible ingredients,0
Better than Evian,1
"Oh come on Borghese, why did you stop making Brown Notte???? I wish companies would consider the fact that there are red heads out there that don't wear dark dark brown or black. I'm sure not even blonds and brunettes are always into the super dark colors. I used Notte for years I was turned on to it by someone who also wore contacts as I do ( I wear the pencil inside my eyes) and she said this will not be waxy or make your contacts blurry. I couldn't tell you how happy I was to have been told about this. So for years I purchased it until I went into the store to buy more and low and behold instantly there were no more to be found, none online or any stores, honestly I could have cried. If I would have had a heads up this product was going to be discontinued I would have stocked up. Then I saw this and was equally excited although the color name was different I gave it a shot. WAY too dark, didn't even stay on evenly. I beg of you to please bring back Brown Notte PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!! This was a waste of my dollars to purchase this, I would send it back if I hadn't already used it. Sad customer :(  P.S. I put only once for how often to re apply I only marked that because I didn't put it on anymore after that for it was NOT good.",0
Excellent polish. Love this color and this brand.,1
"I love the curls this iron produces.....and they last!  With any other iron, my curl is gone by the end of the night.  With the bombshell, I still had curls the next morning - I couldn't believe it!  (I have really long - 5 inches under bra line - thick/heavy hair)",1
I like it - don't love it,1
Just opened this- dry and hard to get out of bottle,0
"Very good rotating hot air brush.  I have the Conair one as well, and it is not nearly as good as this one.  First of all, this one is metal and heats more.  Also, the bristles grab my hair more than the Conair.  Took me less time to do my hair with this and it turned out very well.  May not work for everyone, but for my hair it worked (I have straight hair a few inches past shoulders).",1
Love it.,1
"At first I was not using this product very often, so I did not see any result. But after using it on a daily basis for a few weeks my arms are definatly worse!",0
"I have some thinning in my part, and have been using Joan River's Great Hair Day for years. It gives a slight itch sometimes but is easy to brush on and gives full coverage. I bought the Toppik after reading reviews of no itch and how it works better than Great Hair Day. I kept shaking it on my head and it didn't look like the powder even came out. Then I slowly see a pile of powder forming on my hair, and I had to mix it in with my fingers. I even tried using the Great Hair Day brush, to no avail - the brush didn't pick up on the Toppik powder. I used the Toppik applicator for parts which I bought seperately, but that didn't work well either. I'm back to using Great Hair Day and the Toppik is sitting ignored in my closet.",0
The clamp is half the size of the rod so it's difficult to curl your hair. Once your hair is under the clamp it begins to fall out of the clamp as you're attempting to roll the strand in. I wish the clamp was as long as the rod. I don't curl my hair with this one.,0
Very strong neroli  and ylang ylang smell.  I returned it - did not appreciate the scent.,0
The box was all crumbled and the cleanser top was missing as well as the  expiration date on the box,0
I have used a different Rusk product for yrs called Rusk Worx and loved it . The product is nearly impossible to find and when you do the price is exorbitant somI decided to try the Rusk Being Sexy Unisex Spray.  I am very disappointed with the product because the scent is unbearable. I would like to return the 3 cans back but the return policy states I can not due to the nature of the product and shipping constraints mentioned in their policy.  So I guess I am stuck with a product I can't use that costs me $43.26,0
"Really didn't like it, but gave it an extra star cause it does smell great. Just didn't work with my fine hair.",0
Did not work for my hair,0
"If you use this product your skin will immediately feel soft, smooth and ready for anything you might have waiting for your skin.  By that I mean the way your moisturizers go on, followed by your base make-up - it is effortless.  I love using this product because it only takes a pea size amount so I do my face 1X in AM and 2X in PM to be sure all of the days ""stuff"" if cleaned and off my face.",1
"I discovered this in the Mario Badescu salon in NYC - where one of their reps suggested I use this for gentle exfoliation and summer acne flare ups. A bottle should last you more than a year if you use the right amount (a tiny dab per wash - it lathers very well & glycolic acid is powerful stuff).  Massage the lather thoroughly to allow the acid time to penetrate your skin. Use a little more if you have lots of makeup on. I tried DDF and other brands afterwards (of glycolic wash) and none measure up to Mario Badescu's. Your skin stays bright and fresh (from the non abrasive exfoliation), and the product just smells clean (not over perfumed or chemical laden).  The glycolic toner will not last you as long, but is a good pairing if you have summer induced acne (minor t-zone/hairline). I recommend getting a salon consultation or reading up on their web page to gauge the frequency of use that is good for you. I consider this a bathroom cabinet staple, and in the fall/winter, I rotate use of it with a more moisturizing wash.  Regardless of season, rinse well and always follow up with the right moisturizer for your skin.",1
"I apply this to my eyes each and every morning.  It is silky as you roll it on and you immediately get a refreshing tingle from what I think is menthol.  I look forward to putting this produce on in the morning, as it helps to invigorate me before I face the day!
I have an infant so lord knows I have some major under eye bags.  Not only does this product feel great and help me wake up, it eliminates all visible signs of fatigue from under my eyes,",1
I agree with some of these reviews!  I have had this curling iron for about 18 months and today it completely burned and singed my hair!  I have been using various curling and flat irons for at least 30 years and have never had one malfunction like this!  It was on the lowest setting and it burned and took out a big chunk of my hair.  I'm not sure what caused this to happen but this is downright dangerous! I will not buy this brand again.,0
"These are convenient to have in the car for the occasional diaper blowouts. Mustela products are gentle and though their fragrance is a little strong, work well for both my toddler and newborn",1
"Fantastic!! Love the lipstick.
Bought 2 different colors. And I taken potos after 5 hours later..still pretty..",1
Okay,1
I know it's hairspray like product and it doesn't really smell great to begin with but it's like they didn't even try. It smells like chemicals used at a mechanic shop so... that's kind of a bummer. I love BSH line though and it does work so I usually just spritz a little dry shampoo over it to mask the smell.,1
I love this eye cream! A friend recommended it recently and it works wonders. You have to use it every day though. I can see a different when I stop using it.,1
"Terrible flat iron, do not recommend.  It doesn't grip hair entirely, therefore pulls and pinches throughout the process.",0
In case you have dry scalp this is a worth while buy.  This shampoo definitely cleans your hair more thoroughly than anything else along with taking care of dray scalp.,1
Poor staying power....,0
The lip gloss is all dried up and I couldn't figure out how to return it.,0
"I generally have very good luck with retinol. It plumps up the face, it manages to moisturize, reduces fine lines....and all of that happened when I used this product. This is probably the third or fourth product I have used by Vichy, and an unfortunate side effect, at least for my skin type, has been clogged pores.  I have very large pores, combination skin, that is typically sensitive to harsh perfumes.  I get the plumping, the fine line reduction, a nice balance of moisture, but my pores start to look pretty scudzy by day three of use.  Then I need to do a quick exfoliation before problems begin.  This might just be typical of my skin type.",1
"I wanted to love this sunscreen and bought two, one for me and one for my boyfriend. He is outside all day at his job used it every day for two weeks and he slowly got more and more red/tan. I used it a few days with my friends at a pool and didn't go in the water once, I got a great tan but that's not what I was going for! Sadly, we are returning these and going to have to keep looking for a quality physical sunscreen.",0
When I used this brand of shampoo at a hotel I noticed it greatly helped my scalp psoriasis. I have been using it for a few years now. It can also used to wash areas that would get aggravated by soap.,1
Its quite expensive and it didn't do anything to help my scalp.,0
great color.  doesn't chip,1
"I like this color, it's a dark green with some shimmer,  however it's so dark that it's almost black.  Now this is exactly what I was looking for at the time, however the more I stare at it, the more I wish it was just slightly lighter. It comes off as dark grey indoors and I spend too much time inside to really enjoy it. But it looks exactly as advertised so I can't really give it a bad rating either. I just ended up not liking it.",1
"I originally wrote a good review for this product as it seemed to diminish wrinkles, however be aware:  I went to my dermatologist showed her attached pic and she also had recent pics of my neck.  She said there's a chemical that decreases fatty tissues which is why it's not recommended for face.  She suggested I use remaining product for my elbows, knew, and buttocks.  I have a Long, thin neck with little fatty tissues.  I'm now paying for Fraxell to go back to where I was before Nectifirm.",0
Save your money and believe the reviews.,0
"I've only been using the NuFace Trinity Facial Toning Device & the Wrinkle Reducer for a about 3 weeks.  I do see some slight improvements so I'm looking forward to see how it does over time.  Nothing drastic but subtle.  The ""device"" will not take place of surgery.",1
Doesn't seem to do anything..,0
Love this amazing product!!,1
Too small for the price,0
"I got this straightener about 20 days ago. First time I used it I liked how it left my hair: perfect waives that last for 3 days until I wash it again. All perfect. Second time, the paint started peeling up and the cord is twisting itself after 15 minutes of use. The ""titanium"" plate is also already scratched. Regarding my hair, it's getting damage even though I used a medium temperature this time. It smells like it's getting burned and it looks a little dry. I have been straightening my hair once a week with a ceramic one and this never happened to me.

2 days ago, I just found out that I got an expensive Chinese version. I saw an stylist girl's Babyliss straightener and it seems like is made of different materials than mine. The color tone is a little different (mine actually looks like it was hand painted), also the design is not the same.

I wanted to return it but the package didn't come with any returning label nor instructions to get refund (something that I found suspicious from the beginning) and the Amazon's returning policy says that the product has to be like new condition. Since this peace of garbage is already peeled and scratched I have have to throw it away before it kills my hair.

I feel insulted. I totally lost faith in Amazon.

..................................
<Update>

I got an email from the seller days before my guarantee was expired. They sent me a shipping label and gave the instructions of how to return the product. I had already thrown the packaging away but they still accepted it and in a couple days I got my money back.

Thank you EbeautySalon and I apologize I did not update my review before but I didn't find the option to delete it or make any update.",0
"I can't say I've seen any results from using this. I've been to professional hair removers for a few years, and theirs work much better.",0
"I was so excited when I got this in the mail. The smell was great, packing great. Now fast forward a month of using it and the sprayer broke..

I loved the price I paid but next time I'll buy something in store and hopefully get more use out of it!",0
"Beware, FAKE Fragrance. I have bought the same fragrance directly from Lacoste previously, this one is 100% fake. Weak smell differs a lot from original, low quality packaging.",0
"This was for my roommate and I must admit that for being a unisex fragrance it's pretty good, pricy but very nice",1
I am 52 and my daughter was going on about this product. She was elaborating on how much she likes the balm. I thought I would give it a try and was plesently suprised now I am telling people how much I like it.,1
"I absolutely love this color when all is said and done. It's the most beautiful and delicate shade of pinky-nude, matches everything, and is my go to color for date nights, formal events, etc. It stays put for a long time; I used to work with my hands in water all day, and it still didn't chip or peel for a little over a week. Now that I have a different job, the color will stay up to two and a half weeks!

However, the formula is very, very thin and watery, making the first couple of coats streaky. It takes at least three coats to build the color up to opaque, but if you're willing to work with it, it is absolutely worth purchasing.",1
"When I squeezed it out of the tube, I thought there was no way the coverage would be very good because the consistency is kind of watery.  However, the coverage is medium-full with one layer, and if you do a second layer it is full coverage (covers most of my freckles). I would say it would be best for oily skin, because in my drier spots it looked a little cakey. The one thing I thought was strange was the smell, which was kind of chemical-smelling.  Otherwise, it looks very smooth and wears to a semi-dewy finish on normal or oily skin.",1
"I hate strong hairsprays that leave your hair ""glued"" into place.
W8less holds your style, but feels soft and natural.
My favorite hairspray.",1
I love the way my skin feels. It seems cleaner and smoother. I been using it for a couple of months. I get a facial  once a month and she has noticed a change in my skin.,1
"Bad spray nozzles. Ordered 3 cans, 2 so far is a total waste. Very expensive with little product to use from it.",0
"Love it, huge improvement. Made hair shiny, soft, and silky.",1
"I love the way this product makes my hair feel when it's dry, and the minty sensation it causes on my scalp is a delicious eye-opener on difficult mornings. One of the nicest conditioners I have ever used.  However, my only concern is that the texture of the conditioner is a little too thick or ""paste-like"", making it difficult to achieve adequate coverage of my hair without using quite a bit of it, and I have to be careful not to lather it in too vigorously or it tugs out a few strands of my hair! (this has never happened with any other conditioner before or after using this product. I have a dynamite hairline.) The directions do recommend using a ""liberal amount"", and gently massaging it in eliminates the hair-tugging problem, so I don't consider these issues dealbreakers. But at more than $1.50 per fluid oz, 5-10x more expensive than store-bought options, I expect to be completely satisfied. The drawbacks cause it to fall just short of 5 stars. All that being said, I will likely be a repeat customer until I find something better. Recommended with the aforementioned caveats.",1
"Works really great on my face...I love it, and the shipping was so fast..thanks PMD, will definitely recommend this to a friend.",1
Color is nice but the liquid doesn't glide smoothly to the nail... This is my third coat! I will review again if it gets better.,0
The pump did not work on the bottle.,0
Smell good as comments from others and regret that didn't buy a larger size,1
Good!,1
I have been using this product for the last year and won't go without it.  I definitely see a difference in fine lines.,1
My face started bleeding jk,0
Great little brush.  It really does a good job of applying my highlighter.  My highlighter goes on quickly and easily and because it has two brushes (one at either end} I don't have to change brushes to highlight different areas of my face.,1
"Product is fantastic - not too 'strong' of a hold, but yet does provide good hold, and keeps the wild hair in place.",1
"Best heavy hold water soluble ""pomade"" on the market.",1
"It does not smell as advertised.  In fact, not really noticeable and NOT worth the price",0
Left my hair sticky,0
It's a miracle in a wipe! Stops sewating immediately! The only down side is that it leaves a white flaky film in the area of use. I guess you can't have everything! Excellent for those that suffer from hyperhydrosis.,1
"For me, this cream is a nice addition for the summer months. I like it much better than the Proraso green ""tub"" of cream. The key is not to be afraid to use a little more cream to ensure a nice slick lather. Depending on where I shave and the type of water (hard / soft) I can adjust the amount of cream used accordingly. However, I tend to think I use a little more of this cream per shave than I do with other brands to achieve the same lather (which is ok since it's so reasonably priced).

Is it ""as good"" as some of the other creams I've used? I tend to think not. While I do enjoy the sensation the menthol gives my head and face, this cream tends to dry out a little faster than the Taylor of Old Bond Street or Geo F. Trumpers creams. As long as you keep the lather moist, you will not have any issues. With that said, I think I will always keep this cream ""in stock"". It's a nice change up every now and then and a nice way to beat the heat.",1
"I know people love this but for me, it was too expensive and greasy feeling. Personally I wasn't a fan of the smell, but my husband likes it. I prefer neutrogenas pure and free which is a lot cheaper. Nothing wrong with this though. Didn't cause any skin problems and would use it if I didn't have my neutrogena face sunscreen. Just too expensive given cheaper alternatives.",1
"I agree with the other reviewer  the pump in this tube is basically nonfunctional, so I squeeze the product out. It's a minor flaw but easily worked around. This seems to be much gentler than most other sulfur products I've used before, so it works well on my dry skin. If your skin is quite oily, I'm not sure how effective it would be, but I like it.",1
Love this stuff!,1
"Aimez-Moi first hits you with a soft, slightly powdery wave of violet, accented with anise. It dries down nicely and, on my skin, lasts nearly all day. It's a beguiling scent that isn't too LOUD or FRUITY - instead, it kind of winks at you and draw you closer for another sniff. It has a warm basenote that stays with you. It's really delightful.",1
"I love euphoria, but the endless is not the same good smell as the regular euphoria..",0
"Great hairdryer! Cord doesnt stay plugged in, annoying more than anything! Would definitely recommend to a fellow stylist!",1
I love it even though you have to buy the shampoo separately it's totally worth it. Years ago I paid a salon $300 to straighten my hair.. and they used this exact product not I did my own for a fraction of the price,1
"box squashed and pump completely broken. No sprayer, have to pour this expensive serum into my hand, when its meant to spritz. Support offered no help with even a replacement pump. I even offered to pay for a new pump. Bummer :(",0
"I used MEG 21 just after a laser resurfacing facial and it provided some  immediate calming.  There was a slight reducing of redness.  I like the way it goes on.  It is difficult to see exactly how much remains in the jar to know when to reorder before running out completely, though.",1
Did nothing for my hair.,0
"Perfect. Adds the perfect amount light  of coverage and skin benefits (short and long term). I put it on every morning, as a base to powder makeup or just as is.",1
It is what I ordered and expected,1
I have tried lots of hair gels over the years and this one is absolutely the best for getting the job done.  Not sticky and the smell is lovely.,1
"This is my endless love of fragrance. ..
It is fresh and classy.
Love it!!!",1
"Horrible product. Damaged my skin Plus return process is a nightmare!

Stay away from this product.",0
"Great hair product! I can't find it anywhere around locally, so I just order it on the internet. Saves a lot of time looking for it and gas too!",1
"Used the product over a month now.  I have combination skin and love it.  =)
It sprays on like it's masking your face but it absorbs very quickly.  It makes you very hydrated but not shiny.  Scent is also not too strong, which is a big plus.  Love the product",1
It does not work on me. I don't recommend this product those who want to control the flaking. It makes my hair more oily.,0
This product really works.  I am a female over 55 and I use it for my ever expanding part in my hair.,1
I purchased this blower from a different website- but I have curly hair and after a while my old blow dryer didn't seem to be strong enough--WELL THIS ONE IS! It works really well and I haven't had any issues with it --except that a friend of mine tried to use it and burned her hair -because she has thin- naturally straight hair and it was to strong for her hair.. I guess she should have used it on the lowest setting.....But anyway its a good blow dryer and its cheaper than I paid for mine..I would definitely recommend it!,1
This product is hard to use.  It is such a thin liquid that it slides off your finger before you try to apply it.,0
"Funny smell, not much better than Biore strips.",0
Love the mascara but it arrived dry.,0
Did not really curly my eyelashes well. Also felt like it was going to rip my eyelashes out.,0
"I have purchased this product in salons for several years, and it always smelled great.  This bottle smells like it is halfway between the usual smell and a box of bicycle inner tubes.  I will not order this through any shipper ever again.",0
It did not make my skin supple in any way. For the money this was really a lousy product.,0
It's Fake the pack it's different compared with the real one. I'm so sad about that. Don't buy it.,0
Best mascara ever!!,1
"Used it once - its too heavy, it is sitting in my drawer, will not be be using this hair dryer",0
My cheap straight iron works better and you don't have to remember which way to hold it.  The curl looked OK at first but my hair was straight within an hour.  The curl from my flat iron lasts all day.,0
"I feel like this product dries out my scalp.

It makes my hair nice and clean and soft but shortly after I feel like my scalp is itchy. This does not happen with any other product",0
My skin is very sensitive and this stuff made my wrinkles look deeper. I guess because it was drying out my skin. Did what they recommended and still was very drying,0
"Didn't work for me. My hair gets really frizzy, especially in the summer humidity. It did not stop the frizz or hold the curl.",0
"Works great for me, look and feel 5 years younger.",1
"This thin-consistency luxury sun lotion caused profuse pimple development within a week of adopting use. It works fine as a body sunscreen but I would recommend avoiding if you are acne-prone.

I also took stars for the high price, small container, and gritty texture",0
"I would have rated it higher but the smell was over-whelming.  At first it seemed to smell good, but after waiting for mask to dry it was unbearable.  I love smelly stuff but this was just too much!!!",0
It's expensive for such a small bottle and I had to use twice as much product to get mediocre results.  I really could never get all my mascara off with just the Klorane remover. I prefer the makeup removers by Sonia K and Philosophy. Both remove all my eye makep and both are priced better. Klorane does not sting the eyes at all and safe for contact users.,0
Watch the return policy with Crabtree and Evelyn. They don't back up their products. Worst customer service for a defective product in years for me.,0
It works well but it doesn't last as long as I like.  It keeps working but it shuts off too soon as it overheats.  I've had a couple before this one.  Bought those in a store.  It costs more in a store.  I would buy one again as I can't find anything else like it.,1
GREAT!!!!!!,1
I have used many Avene products in Europe before and so far like the day and night creams very much.,1
"I use this pump with the Xfusion hair fibers.  A great product.  Again I lost my hair due to chemotherapy for breast cancer, and it has not regrown on the top of my head and I just pump the fibers in and it looks just perfect.  Can't tell that there is no hair on my bald spot.",1
This is a pretty muted purple/pink with an iridescent purple running through it. It has great dimension and the wear time is exceptional - however you will need at least 3 coats for it to be opaque.,1
"I have had this hair dryer for 2 years now. It was great when I first started using it.  I need the concentrator to style my hair and the concentrator just slides onto the end of the nozzle. Over time, it would would start flying off when I used the high speed on the dryer.  When I would pick it up off the floor, it was burning hot so I had to use a towel to put it back on the hair dryer.  After numerous times of flying off the hair dryer, the concentrator cracked.  This made it worse as it would not stay on at all anymore.  I've been looking at newer models of the same hair dryer and it seems that they have not had any complaints about the concentrator because they are still made the same way so I a staying away from BaByliss, which is disappointing since I really like the hair dryer. My other complaint was that it was just too heavy. I'm trying so hard to find a hair dryer that will give me the results that BaByliss could.....just wish they didn't have the flaws that really bother me.",0
"Great product!
I have been using lots of  different products  and even mixing them to improve results since  was not satisfied with any of them.
Finally I tried Twirl Around  and the searching finished this one is excellent! I am very happy using it and enjoying  that real it works alone, no need of any other one, easy to use and gives  wonderful results!
I have a mix of curly and wavy, dry  and frizzy difficult hair!! This Twirl Around is the only one that not only nourish but separates gives pretty shape and  hold!! All in one
Highly recommended!",1
"Smells like oranges, pricey for daily shampoo. It dries out my hair if i don't condition with their brand of conditioner with their shampoo, so its pretty pricey",0
my wife uses this procuct and we ordered it and recieved it.  went fine. i would do it again thanx,1
Didn't work for me. I like the way my actual hair felt with this product but it made my dandruff worse.,0
Works great!,1
"Perfect color choice for this Spring and Summer! Long wearing, doesn't chip, has a nice shine without having a""glittery"" look.",1
This product is not what you buy at a salon. This product makes my hair sticky and smells like vodka.,0
Great :),1
pretty color but it takes a lot of coats to be opaque. I put white under it.,1
"Nice cleaning cream, made my skin feel softer, moisturized and refreshed.
(moisturizing feeling lasted for me about 1 hr)
After dampening skin, the cream guides smoothly over face.
Half a dime size amount is enough to cover my face, foams up in a few seconds.
Doesn't have any sensation while on skin.

This is a rich, thick, pearly looking cream with a mild, light fragrance, but no scent is left on skin.
It's easy to apply, works quickly as it foams and is quickly removed with a water without any greasy feeling.
Nice product for extra deep cleansing.",1
"This shampoo is ok.  It smells nice, and has a unique thick consistency.  My hair was shiny after I used it--though not hugely different than when I use any other shampoo.  The shampoo does NOT deliver results that render it worth the ridiculously high price, though!  The label claims it to be ""the fountain of youth for hair"" and to ""protect your hair and hair color"", and touts all the amazing ingredients in it.  Yet, when I looked up the ingredients, the 2nd and 3rd ingredients (after water) are Sodium Laureth Sulfate, and Fragrance...the same JUNK you would get in any 99 cent bottle of drugstore brand shampoo!  Sodium Laureth Sulfate is an inexpensive lathering product--basically a detergent--and one that is commonly known to fade color treated hair, not protect it! (Many hair stylists recommend sulfate-free shampoos for color treated hair). You have to go way down the ingredient list, past a long list of chemicals, to get to the ""pure plant extracts"" that the label touts.  You can easily find a better shampoo, for 1/10 the price. I won't waste my money on this again.",0
The best for dry skin on scalp!!!,1
"I agree with the complaints regarding lather. It does not. Don't bother with a brush, it will be useless. I spread a thin layer by hand and in that application it works well. I think Baxter needs to explain this better.",0
Bought this product for my daughter after reading all the great reviews.  Save your money~!!  She tried it for several weeks with no results.  Doesn't live up to what is written about it.,0
"I have found that Pureology is one of the few companies that have products that do exactly what they claim they do. I'm very pleased with this product, the delivery was within the time I expected and was in great condition.",1
Better than any very expensive products so far. Will keep using/buying this. Highly recommended one!,1
"I have been using this product for years, but this new bottle contains product that is bright yellow, nothing like what I have used in the past whch was a creamy white. And it does not work the same way. I am going to return.",0
I guess there is really no substitution for real hair on your head!,0
"I have always love thIs iron , my husband gave me one for Chirstmas  2013 and I love it . I buy a new one to give it to my sister because I know she is going to love it too , it has work perfect for me , straigh my hair really fast and easy .",1
Love this product! Great scent!,1
"This is basically a container with olive oil and pointed qtips to touch up eye makeup mistakes and smears.  It works just fine. Just apply to the area and pat down the residue and you are good to go.  I think it's a good product but the price is pretty high considering you could pretty much make this yourself at home for a fraction of the cost.  It looks good however and this setup is very portable.  I think it would be much more appropriately priced at about half of what it is now.  If price is not an issue, it's a worthy makeup tool.",1
"So unhappy with this product. This product was USED. There was hair grease on it and the curler was dirty. I am disgusted and If I could give zero stars, I would.",0
"Listen up people, this is one of the best products that Jack Black has to offer.  A little pricey, but worth every penny!!  Great for both Men and Women.",0
"The color shown for Renee is an almost neon pink, however the polish that I received is more of a muted brownish red color. The polish is NOTHING like what is pictured. I was not impressed with the formula either. It was sort of tacky and not very opaque. It is also very patchy... almost like it pools in certain spots so it leaves you with darker, more thicker looking areas on the nail.",0
"Not worth the price, though adequate.",0
chose because of write up in real simple magazine - ridiculous price and worthless - no better than a pc. of typing paper.,0
Good stuff help s with shaving bump s,1
No noticeable change in volume.  A complete waste of money.,0
"Both colors are not for the faint of heart, the red is my FAVORITE true red. Ever. The pink is a very bright, cooler pink. This is very matte, and very durable. After several hours it may feel a bit dry, but not unbearable, very smooth, rich feel on application. Buildable. Doesn't come off
Until you want if off. If you like bright lips, if you don't want to reapply constantly. Try this product! (Exfoliate lips before applying)",1
I don't see any change after 4 weeks of use.....,0
Very satisfied,1
"Got this for my daughter who just had her first baby 4 mounths ago. She said it really seems to help with her streach marks. She said it's still a little too early to know for sure, but she hopping it works the way they say it does.",1
"this spray is just ok, didn't detangle all that well and it definitely didn't dry with a nice texture or anything . I recommend the smoothing cream and the argan treatment tho. They both made my hair very easy to comb and when dry my hair felt like silk. They didn't weigh my hair down either and I have fine silky hair",0
"Best quality hairspray I've ever tried.  Only wish it was easier to find, since my stylist doesn't carry it anymore.  I'm glad to have found it on Amazon.  This product is not a sticky, smelly formula, but holds in a light natural finish for my curls.  Easy to run fingers through long hair - very natural looking while holding style. I am particular to scents and this was not at all offensive, but light/pleasant. Product shipped super fast.",1
love the product but a little expensive.,1
I am 51 years old and was still getting pimples so I started using this product that my aesthetician recommended and I haven't had one break out.  It's been almost a year now.  Fabulous product!,1
"used this for years, don't know why Laszlo quit making shake-it",1
"Every year presents the same dilemma: flowers? candy? dinner? what? This little bar of rose-scented cat was jussst right. As a gift to a nice feminine friend, one cannot miss. And it helps to have a real live white cat, too.",1
It DOES NOT plump the lip. But it primes & moisturizes my lip very well. I have patchy & parched coffee addict lips so I'm surprised how well it's working on me. Feels luxurious on my lips too. Love it even without plumping. A bit too expensive for my liking though.,1
This thickening shampoo is not as good as another that I am currently using - OGX Thick & Full Biotin & Collagen Shampoo is awesome!,0
"No the color was way too light then what was described.  But this was a new product for me and ordering this kind of stuff, first time, online is hard.",0
"After reading some other reviews, I do have to say that it is true that Stila Prime Pot eye primer does dry awfully fast. You just have to be quick about putting it on. I do put on eye cream before using it so it doesn't dry as fast.

I love this product! It has the best coverage of all the primers/concealers that I've ever used. It has such good coverage that when I had a black eye last week and I used this product to cover it up, no one could tell that my eye was bruised! I frequently use this as an under-eye concealer as well as an eye shadow primer. I find that my eye shadow stays in place all day.",1
"I am disappointed with  my purchase and this products, its too heavy to hold also handle is too thick to hold , and it is not suitable fro long hair at all.  I  only use it once as i was exited to see if does what promised but very disappointed and would like to return it if possible",0
"Color is so different, n broken....",0
This had a really strange awful smell when I opened it I had to throw it away .,0
"PCA Skin is a good skincare brand and I wanted to give this lip treatment a try. I live in a Denver where its super dry, especially in wintertime, so my lips are constantly cracked and peeling and dry. This lip treatment feels a lot like Vaseline going on with a nice minty flavor. It doesnt last very long even without eating or drinking. It is moisturizing but because it doesnt really last the effect is very temporary. Not worth the cost IMO.",1
great eye shadow!,1
"Discovered this shaving cream about a year ago after decades of having difficulty shaving.  The Art of Shaving system is the only thing I have ever used that does not cause my face to break out in horrible, painful bumps.  This shaving cream specifically lasts a very long time; you only need a small amount on a brush to get good coverage.  The scent is light enough to not be bothersome in any way, yet good enough for my wife to absolutely love it after I shave.",1
The smell is a bit strong for baby.,1
I've used several pads and these aren't much different than any other brand. They do the job and work well.,1
doesn't work and they start charging $90 a month on your payment method automatically from out of the country!!! So deceiving!!!,0
very happy of both purchases,1
"My wife loves it, excellent",1
"The first time I used the brush the gold lettering started to come off.  This didn't seem right to me so I wrote to Mason Pearson directly.  Below is their detailed reply.  It is worth noting that I never use hand lotion or products in my hair other than shampoo, conditioner and water.  These brushes are an investment, and I would rather spend a little more and have the confidence of an authentic product from an authorized retailer.

Thank you for your enquiry. We do not sell online, neither do we supply any websites with our products. As we are experiencing problems with forgeries at the moment, we cannot guarantee that the hairbrushes any website is selling are genuine Mason Pearson products as we do not supply direct any online stockist. Consequently, Amazon is not an authorised stockist.

The idea of forgeries as you would imagine is to pass them off as the original article that is why we can usually only tell if a hairbrush is a forgery, other than by purchasing through an authorised stockist, is by one of our brushmakers actually examining it, which means we may have to dismantle then reassemble the hairbrush in this process. There are usually no tell tail signs to identify a replica even the boxes and the enclosed leaflets have been very cleverly copied on the forgeries we have come across.

Mason Pearson hairbrushes are still made virtually by hand as they were over 125 years ago when Mason Pearson Bros. Ltd. was founded. Consequently, as applies to the uniqueness of any hand-made item there is likely to be a slight variation in each item produced. Therefore, the impression (by hand) of the Mason Pearson logo and the amount of gold paint used may vary from brushmaker to brushmaker and hairbrush to hairbrush. So it is quite acceptable for there to be some variation. Also, the gold paint we use is not made up of the same properties as it used to be as some of the ingredients may no longer be available or have changed over the years and that can change the adhesive qualities  A classic example of this is where paint use to contain lead, which of course, we are sure you are aware is now illegal but this did change the constituents that paint was made up of.

This also applies to the plastic we use in the making of the hairbrush back/handle, they are not made up of the same properties as they used to be as some of the ingredients may no longer be available or have changed over the years and that can change the plastics qualities, the hairbrush back/handle is made of Cellulose Acetate. The old type of plasticiser  (DMP) cannot be used for health reasons in the processing so is banned by the REACH regulations. So, as you can see and for good reason some ingredients are restricted by law these days. Consequently, we can only use the best raw materials that are AVAILABLE to us at the given time, which of course can change over time.  The stamping is allied to this in that the newer plasticiser makes it harder to stick the gold to the surface.

You might also like to bear in mind other factors that can affect the gold paint. The natural chemicals/oils from the hand/body can attack the gold paint and tarnish the gold effect, as can chemical residue from products such as hand/body lotions/perfumes/deodorant/hair products etc. and sometimes where hairbrushes are kept in bathrooms the moisture in the air can attack the gold paint, or where the hairbrush is kept where it is likely to be in the sun.

We hope this information is helpful to you.

Best wishes,
Mason Pearson Bros. Ltd.",0
This looks like a fake. The original I ordered from the official website all come in a gel form. This however is liquid.,0
I have used this product for about 15 years and I love it.  I use it in combination with the toner spray and the cream.. I have very few wrinkles for 62 and attribute much of that to this product.,1
"ehhh, im not really sure if this worked or not. I bought it to use to brighten my teeth for my wedding. I honestly don't think that it worked and I used it as recommended.",0
Makes your eyelashes crunchy. Had to apply mascara when they are stiff,0
"Love all of the Oribe line of products,I was introduced to the line at onyx salon, my hair has never been as silky as it now is.
The hairspray has great holding power.",1
It does work very well. Makes my hair smooth just like in the salon. It's a little heavy but definitely worth the price.,1
"I have mixed emotions about this wand. On one hand I loved how it made my hair look, and it didn't take a lot of time. Sadly, only after 6 months of use, I got an ER4 error message and It stopped working. Admittedly, I purchased this from another on-line beauty site. They advised me to wipe it down and make sure no hair product or hair was on it. After doing that, it was still not working. They do not have a return policy after 6 months, so I have to accept store credit. I guess I would like this to be a warning, that for such a pricy beauty tool. (I paid $129.00), it was a big disappointment. Purchased at Christmas time, broke in June. If you decide to purchase anyway, make sure you are aware of the stores return policy, as it's likely it will stop working.  Good luck.",0
Its very noticeable the psrticules on the scalp. Its not blendable.,0
"Super amazing face mask ,,,, just make your skin fresh , tight and glow in 20 mins
The best mask ever I use it for years and I'm still very happy with the results .",1
I never thought i needed a shave oil until I tried this. It really makes shaving easier and my face is more smooth. We have hard water here and with the winter months this was a real help. Smells great too. Wish it was cheaper!,1
"I gave it 4 stars because I find that it is a hair reducer rather than permanent. We are humans we are going to have hair. I just used this on my chin and upper lip only and it has reduced my plucking time to 3 minutes instead of 15-30 minutes. Do the math. I think this is more for the face rather than the body. But to each his/her own.  I need to start doing my under arms. Just been lazy. Perhaps over the summer months. I will come back and review my underarms when I get into the habit of doing them. PS. I'm not sure if the benefit of the laser has anything to do with the fact that I've had several laser hair removal sessions on my chin prior. I've stopped getting my hair professionally done, once I bought this device. I bought it this January from QVC. I got it for a good deal just have to pay 65.00 a month for 6 months. Almost done.",1
"This leaves still a sandy whiteish residue after application. If you are olive skinned, stay away from this.",0
"First off, I am very thankful to the merchant for shipping so quick. The package came in earlier than I had expected. Like their service.

I had ordered this as a tester bottle but i got a packaged bottle with caps. It is just as new (did not have a polythene cover on the box pack though, but i do not mind). Lucky me :) ?

To speak of the perfume, it is just awesome. It seems to be a lasting perfume. The initial notes were very distinctive and spicy. Middle notes seemed to wear same notes as Burberry Weekender. I love the base notes, not overpowering and seems so fresh even after a couple of hours.

I got more than what I had expected.",1
"My facial person used this on me and I loved it ever since. It's a good change from your other daily face sunscreen. It's not too greasy, but it is kinda liquidy. The smell is nice too.",1
"Much to my dismay, this product did not work at all. In fact, my puffy under-eye bags appear worse than ever.

I love this palette! The pans are BIG and the shades are highly pigmented and long-lasting.,1
Smartmag resolved my leg cramps.,1
Too much scrubbing to get makeup off. Found I had to use eye-makeup remover and wash my face as normal first then just use it for exfoliating. Just not impressed,0
"Have used this product for many years, not easy to find as many hair salons do not use Lanza. A bit more expensive, but have tried many others and always go back to this product.",1
Have thick curly hair does not have enough power (wattage) for my hair the high heat option is as if it is a low heat option on a regular blow dryer. Major improvements in power are needed for this to be 5 stars.,0
Great product...works just like i hoped and makes for a amooth shave. I have sensitive skin so this is perfect for me!,1
Just fine,1
"Purchased from asos during a sale for  $12.00.  My first time purchasing a lip crayon.  I absolutely love this product.  Goes on smoothly.  Does not have a bold color on my lips, but im dark skinned so that may be why. For skin reference I wear mac liquid foundation 9.0 and urban decay all nighter liquid foundation 12.0.
Feels nice on my lips.  Nice color.  Works for me.",1
"I really enjoy this product.. I am a mid brown color & the 'Mary-Lou' highlighter shows up great, even better when I damp my fan brush. Now for the blush & bronzer, I get no use out of them. They do not show up AT ALL on my brown skin.",1
Wonderful! I use as setting spray and just a refresher to keep skin moist,1
Waste my money is like water need spray too much to smell,0
It smells good but doesn't have enough foam for my husband's liking.  He uses a brush and straight razor- maybe it's better if you don't use a brush?,1
"This does a nice job of removing eye makeup, but I did still wake up with a few under eye smudges the morning after using. The fabric feels nice on your skin, although it does stain a little - may depend on your brand of makeup.",1
I love the smell of this conditioner. It is good for everyday use.,1
"Good, I 'd love it",1
Good product....fast shipping,1
"I like this toothpaste a lot.  However, I wanted a more clinical based toothpaste on Amazon and I found that. In my opinion,Smart Mouth works better and last longer.",1
"It's about average, for the price I was expecting much more, but no better than off the shelf products like Gillette at much cheaper price",0
This has a really great smell. I bought this for my wife and it works great. Smell is long lasting and not too overpowering. It has a great scent and is a good product. My wife likes the perfume as well.,1
"This is so expensive and does NOT last very long. But it works amazingly and leaves my hair smelling really nice. So this is my special occasion hair product, and I use the RUSK Designer Collection Thermal Serum (works just as well, but the fragrance doesn't compare) for normal days.",1
"The entire glass container was completely shattered and ruined upon arrival. Returning is such a pain in the butt, so we will attempt to use.",0
"Goes on smooth as silk, two coats provide a lovely neutral - or you can just use one as a base coat.",1
Skeptical at first but found no difference with the one I got from macy's. Bought couple of times from amazon so far and am happy with the purchase.,1
"this mask is very rough and when you put on your face is very tense and irritate, i will not recommen for my friend",0
Excelent.,1
"Not the usual quality of L'occitane, shower gel is not very viscous and runs right off. Product does smell nice.",0
"This is not the same as the old Hot Tools. I purchased this exact iron 7 years ago and it held in the heat and the curls were long lasting. This iron (even on the highest heat) does not heat well, and the curls flop. Not sure if its this vendor's issues, or if Hot Tools redesigned their curling irons. This is not a keeper and I purchased another brand.",0
"An excellent scent for a reasonable price, particularly for a young professional man in his mid-twenties. This sample will give you a pretty good idea whether or not you will like the larger bottles. The fragrance is made out of Indian fig leaf, fig fruit, coriander, clary sage, leather, lime and plum. It is also spiced with cinnamon, pepper, along with wooden accords of cedar and sandalwood.",1
I have been using this for about a month. Smell is terrible--almost like chemicals. Also haven't noticed much difference in my hair. Disappointed.,0
My nails are thin and brittle and hoped for a solution.  This did not help.  In order to take it off requires acetone - which is lethal to already weakened nails.,0
"Goes on high color, but a little pressed powder after applying brings color to a perfect shade for me",1
I ordered two tubes and both had an awful fishy smell. The glue also had a terrible consistency--it either came out in pure liquid or hard clumps. I guess I just got a bad batch. Very disappointed in the product. Due to other positive reviews I had high hopes for it.,0
"I like the ""Grande Cosmetics"" line, as I have used them for several years, especially the Grandelash MD lash growth serum (I LOVE THIS).  I was a bit put off by how little there was in this gloss, given the price, but it really does plump the lips up!  The tingle is great!  And taste is actually not off-putting at all, as some glosses are...would buy again.",1
Definitely met expectations. Great eyeliner brush,1
"My dermatologist recommends ISClnical products.  I just started using this instead of plain Super Serum, not sure if it will really be better or not.",1
Too Dry. Not moist at all. Gets very cakey! Don't like!,0
"I am NOT happy at all with this brush! I did some research for a paddle brush to use to straighten my hair while blow drying it and this is the brush that was recommended. Some of the bristles have bent, melted or popped out and is con caving on itself.",0
This is great stuff as long as you don't want it to repair your hair. It makes your hair look great but only as long as you have it in your hair. I bought this to help repair my dry damaged hair. But I will use this until I can find something that will repair it.,1
"Color is not red, as pictured.  It's a glittery salmon color.  I threw it in the trash.  Waste of money.",0
I ordered this product because I have so many skin allergies and after hearing about it from a friend I thought I'd try it. I put it on my legs and torso after showering and my skin turned red immediately and began to itch so I had to cleanse my body again. I was so disappointed since I have read some good reviews.,0
I am returning this item--I bought it from a grocery instead. It made my hair sticky! I think it's an imitation.,0
"A tad bit oill, but does wonders for dry skin. This is going to be my daily goto lotion this winter.",1
"This foundation is very sticky and does not provide enough coverage for blemishes. It is also too dark for very fair skin. It may be good for medium skin tones with clear skin. I've been mixing it with a lighter foundation to add some color, so it wasn't a complete waste of money. Still wasn't worth the price in my opinion.",0
Great case for storing your brushes in...can fit lots in..not just one per slot...and really handy having the side pocket with the zip to store a few things in....it is on the larger size though so unless you have a really large handbag it's not that good for taking out with you...I use mine for travelling so it's just in my suitcase/carryon...,1
"The color in the middle is more pink than I wanted. Regardless, its a nice travel palette.",1
"I have to be careful what products I use because of allergies. I checked out the ingredients in this product and felt confident that I could use it. I saw where it has Olive fruit and Argan oils and I know from using these two that they are excellent for your skin. There are other oils in it as well, but none of them caused me any reaction to the product.  The first day I used it, I put it on my legs. I am also smell sensitive and to me It does have a strong smell to it, not a bad smell, just a strong one.  However, it leaves after about five minutes or so.  It went on smooth, not sticky, which was nice and I didn't have to use a lot.  What was amazing is how my legs felt after it was absorbed into the skin, that didn't take long either.  I glided my fingers down them and I was surprised that they felt like  silk. Wow! After about a week of use I could also see where my legs looked much healthier and younger. Of course I liked that, what woman wouldn't?  I really feel this is a product that I can recommend. I'm excited to see the improvements as I continue to use it. Good product.",1
Great as always!!!,1
"This product arrived clearly used. It had dirt and soap residue still on the handle (so gross!), which was also discolored. The battery charger was also very dirty and scuffed up. No cleanser was included and the brush showed signs of use. It also did not turn on despite indicating it is fully charged. Very disappointed in Amazon, as I typically have great experiences with my purchases. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it.  My friends and family with this brush all love it.",0
I don't like its size that is too big to carry and also don't like smell......,0
Disappointed,0
Tried to open for use nothing came out of container sent back for another one same thing happened sent back,0
"One of my biggest concerns that I will never know the answer is, if this product is legitimate and if it comes from the original manufacture. I called the original manufacture and they said they don't allow third-party sellers and that they can't guarantee legitimacy of this product . ",0
It is nice that alot of companies are now making products that are made for men. I go into CVS or Rite Aid and instead of the 90% womens hair products to the usual 10% men hair care products has changed considerable. Men actually have their own aisle now. Lol This was great on my straight hair held my hair for the whole day with the help of a little hair spray. Smell was great too. The only thing I was somewhat disappointed was the size of the container. Very small plus the cost is a little high for my budget. But the product itself is a definate winner!,1
Didn't care for this product. Didn't do much to save my colored treated hair,0
"Got this for my daughter who gets greasy hair in the front.  Works well, but is REALLY!!! small.  Predominently corn starch....may be the way to go next time.",1
This is a great curling iron if you want looser curls or almost straight with body. It does wonderfully with the quick heat up too. I would totally recommend this curling iron.,1
"Excellent product, my hair stays soft without getting frizzy.",1
"My son and DIL got this for me for Mother's Day, in a set.....being in a set the tube is smaller.  I am thrilled to find it here at Amazon...at twice the size.

This cleanser has a ""hard to put your finger on"" scent, but it's crisp and clean smelling. After sudsing it rinses off easily and leaves your skin feeling clean without any leftover residue.

The scent it leaves behind is very subtle and just ""clean""  Accompany the shower gel with the body lotion AND the hand cream and your skin is going to be in EXCELLENT condition.",1
"I have dark brown hair and ordered the black (which I suggest if your hair is really dark) - It covered well. It does leave a bit of a weird feeling in the hair so if the roots were super long, I'm not sure it would be idea. However, it's day two (didn't wash my hair) and there's no need to re-apply. It's still covering the grey bits.",1
"Love the color. Has a bit of a brown undertone to it, but it goes well with most grays.

Essie is a thicker polish, some of the darker colors will need 2 coats, but 2 coats is always best for a glossy finish. I type a lot and do hand work so it's nice to have a great color that lasts at least a week before looking like I've put my nails in the wood chipper!",1
"I have large fat hands, this is a little short for me. Chrome finish is okay, however finish could have been better and more complete... guess the Germans are becoming more American in their work ethics. Lol",1

"If you enjoy the pleasant smell of a face cream that does absolutely nothing but exude a nice aroma, feel free to waste you money on this. Dragon's Blood purports to work miracles, yet falls way, way short.",0
I like this product except when it gets near the end it is very hard to get out.  Also if you don't shake it up very well before using a lot of clear oil will come out.  Nice color though & it doesn't leave any make-up lines.,1
Love the sprinklers clamp. No more lines in hair. Perfect curls every time! I love this curling iron!! It takes some practice. There are dozens of how to videos on YouTube that will help.,1
It is really small and it is not working on my hair. Very disappointed that used Paul Mitchell's name!,0
"The cream itself is fine. However, this should not be sold at all. Literally on the tube it says sample, not for individual sale. The fact that Amazon is selling this product is a problem. It is minuscule! Don't be parted from your cash-just go to a counter and get a sample for free.",0
Worked good for 11 months and then died:-(  To short a life for the price paid.,0
Overpriced for amount. Truly disappointed,0
"Terrible. It has a 60 day money back guarantee but it says you need to use it for 90 days to see results. I used it religiously for 90 days and it cut back on the amount of hair but the laser area is so small and you have so many hair follicles, that it seems that it would take 10 years to actually get them all. It was fairly time consuming too. Not really painful if you are used to waxing but the results just were not there.",0
I bought this product to help with small breakouts on my chin / jaw area.  I was worried that the product would bleach my pillowcase since it has Benzoyl Peroxide in it but I have not had this issue.  My skin feels softer after use and I see a noticeable different in my breakouts when used consistently.  I have not experienced any excess drying or flaking like I have had with other acne products.  Definitely a five star product!! Also price much lower then at my local Ulta store.,1
"this was faick,is not real hugo boss.",0
This is the first product I have ever used thato made my sting and eyelids swell.  Definitely do NOT recommend.,0

"Bought this for my wife, she loves the smell.  Wears it everyday.",1
"Saw someone's instructional video that suggested this as bronzer and bought it. No regrets, I love it. Color goes on dark but blends easily if you are worried about splotches. Not orangey so no fake bake look.",1
"This product once was my favorite but no more. Jack Black for some reason changed Beard Lube's formula from the lightweight silicone based lotion to a plant based dense paste. It's very difficult to wash off of the shaver, leaving residuals that clog the shaver.",0
It is a half of the original bottle and it cost the same. I think it is too expensive.,0
smells like a hospital ward,0
Gives me confidence.  A necessary part of my daily routine.,1
Made my hair dry at the tips and greasy at the roots... Noticed it was much frizzier after using..  Very disappointed for what I paid.,0
"I had low expectations for this product since I don't usually believe in a quick fix, but it does actually work as it claims. Basically, it seems to burn water weight (bloat) from the stomach, so this is only a temporary fix and doesn't get rid of fat. Actually though, after seeing what my stomach looks like without the water weight, I've been feeling encouraged to try to lose the extra fat around my stomach, so I've been eating better and working out more. As a result, I've dropped a few pounds in just a couple of weeks. The only downside I've found to this product is that it's not going to last as long as I had hoped. The gel comes out sort of thick, and even with spreading it around, it still takes more product than I thought it would.",1
Didn't really make a difference with my lashes.,0
Leaves my hair feeling really dry.  :(  I wanted to like it...it's so hard to find organic hair care!,0
Works well and smells good.,1
"I did my research and hence did not have the problem of this not fitting onto my hairdryer like some people did. I have the T3 Featherweight (not the 2).

My problem is that I use a diffuser differently than most people, because I have really long thick hair. I use the 'fingers' to brush my hair and look for a smooth result, with this stupid plastic rim around the edge it actually stops you from being able to get the air deeply into thicker hair, I am simply no good at operating a hair dryer and a brush simultaneously with my length of hair I have to keep putting the hair dryer down to get a new section of hair, I don't have time for that stuff!

I also don't love the dryer, although I didn't buy it at Amazon, it's got stupid buttons instead of slides to turn it on and off and I keep shutting it off while I'm drying my hair and changing hand position!",0
"First, the color shown here, which looks like a soft apricot, was actually a garish orange: my toes look like I am wearing orange peel! Second, as another reviewer mentioned, the polish goes on streaky, and it was only after much effort, and much time, that I was able to achieve some semblance of coverage.  I have never thrown out a polish, but this one I did. I think I will stick to Opi polishes, they have a better quality overall.  As for this Essie polish: COMPLETE FAIL, I hated it!!",0
I really like the sandalwood smell of this shaving soap. It isn't overpowering but leaves a nice scent. The soap lathers very nicely and  my face has felt better since switching from the other stuff I was using. I will probably stick with Prosaso for a while.,1
"I like these rollers because they are flocked and stay in your hair especially when you use the U shaped pins and the plastic jaw style clips that come with the set.  Babyliss,,,why didn't you include a bag to store the plastic clips in???  The rollers do a nice job for me although for my personal preference they could get hotter than they do.  I have thick fine hair (just below jaw length) with some natural wave so my hair tends to want to have it's own way.  I could use about 5 more rollers because with as much hair as I have, 20 rollers are barely enough and I think it would have been helpful to have more of the medium size instead of so many of the large size rollers.  I remember the rollers of yesteryear and these don't get nearly as hot although I am sure just like everything else the manufacturers have had to dumb things down so people won't get burned.  Overall, I am happy with these rollers.  This is the first time I have ever purchased anything made by Babyliss...I hope they last for many years.",1
"My store stopped carrying this product, so I checked on Amazon and was pleased that it was available.  Love it for my hair: keeps it shiny and healthy looking.",1
"I've used other Rusk products before and liked them, so I thought I'd try this one when I found it at my local T.J. Maxx, because I have fine but relatively thick hair that I flat iron frequently. I'd also heard that argan oil, which this contains, is a great product. When I sprayed this on my dry hair before flat-ironing, it made my hair stiff and sticky and almost impossible to use a flat iron on effectively. So, I ended up brushing it through my hair and went and flat-ironed it after that. Now I have a whole can left that I can't use as intended. I think I will try spraying it on my just-shampooed hair, then drying as normal to see if my hair ends up less frizzy.

I notice the description says this can also be used a a finishing spray, but considering how stiff it left my hair, I don't think I would even try it for that purpose.",0
hard to find in stores & MUCH more expensive when you do! it's my favorite hair product of all time!,1
I was skeptical of this product. I now use this product every day as my overall coverage. It's so much healthier than using a foundation and has spf cream in it. If you are on the fence about this product buy it! I apply it every day with a foundation brush and it covers the inconsistencies in my skin tone. I don't look like I have make up caked on everyday at work.,1
"The flat iron is hot and will do its job if you don't mind some annoyances. First, the cord itself starts to curl very shortly after you begin using it and therefore tangles terribly. I do not twist the flat iron like you would a curling iron, so this should not happen. They have simply used cheap wiring. I have other hair styling appliances that do not tangle. This is by far, the worst tangling I have ever experienced. I have to straighten out the very long cord each time I use it. The edges of the flat iron plates also catch on your hair and pull the hair out as you are using it. The end of the flat iron where it hinges, pinches and is a safety hazard. I was very disappointed with this purchase as I had been looking for a Chi for a long time and thought their name meant that the quality of the product would be high. This was far from the truth. I would not recommend this product unless you want many challenges while trying to use it.",0
"The aurora borealis shade is great! Not too blue/green based , ideal for olive skin tones. The Rose gold is subtle but can be built up for more dramatic results.  The silver plum shade is very stylish and versatile.  Of course the silver is fabulous.  That said, my only complaint would be the liquid suspension . The shadow is in would be easier to work with if it was a tad bit thicker/dried quicker.",1
Slimmy and did not hold the hair as did the Designing lotion from Nexxus.,0
"My husband and I just love, love, love this soap.  I won't use any other kind.  It is refreshing and suds up great.",1
This body scrub is amazing and leaves your whole bathroom smelling like a spa!  I would definitely recommend this product.,1
I've been using this product for many years and love it. This bottle was old and rancid as some others have complained. The smell was off from the start.,0
Didn't work ever good on my already thick hair,0
"Can be a little cakey, but after using it a few times the issue turned into a nonissue
It's great for dark circles under the eyes.",1
It is one of my favorites since  long time ago.,1
It's ok. not as good as expected. I bought it because of the good reviews. not good as Kiehl's Almond Acid Shampoo.,0
"Product is good but the lip container needs improvement. Top won't stay on so I won't buy again. it really bothers me that you pay this kind of money and it does not work right, There is BARELY any color. I won't buy this shade again.",0
"Clasp is not spring loaded, and did not have a cool tip.  Burned myself in several places while trying to figure out how to manage.  Probably fine doing on someone else's hair, but found far too cumbersome (and painful) to use on myself.",0
"There is nothing more annoying than having your nails chip less than 24 hours after lacquering them up. Unfortunately, this product does not do anything to help this age old problem. I noticed no difference in my manicure while using this product. For a whopping $9.50 this product is a useless rip off.

After many a manicure, I've found the best long lasting manicure is as follows.

1 coat base coat (I prefer Deborah Lippman's base coat)
2+ coats quality polish (My faves are Butter, Lippman, OPI, Essie, Chanel)
1 thick top coat (I use Essie's Good to Go, but I know many prefer Sally Hansen's Hard As Nails)

This recipe usually lasts me at least a few days before the chips set in. :(",0
I BOUGHT THE LARGE SIZE 2 MONTHS LATER NO CHANGE AT ALL.,0
"Thank you, works very well. Smells great!",1
"This stuff works quite well. Love the matte finish and the hold which is good but not stiff. Great for control without looking too structured. It has a very STRONG scent, sometimes the smell even gives me a headache while I have it in, it's not that I don't enjoy the smell it's just way too strong, that's my only real complaint.",1
One of my favourite face sunscreens... This is a lovely lightweight sunscreen. It smells amazing. Feels lovely on my skin. Lightweight but super hydrating. The perfect sunscreen for my sensitive skin that is both acneic abd aging...,1
"I feel like I've been duped. Having nothing to to with Amazon, I received a free sample-size of this product and fell in love -- it was GREAT! What I most liked about the SAMPLE bottle of Billy Jealousy LIquidSand Exfoliating Facial Cleanser was that it used silica as the ""sand"" ingredient to exfoliate. You know silica. The stuff that sand is actually made out of. I've tried LOTS of exfoliating cleansers and this was the first one that I actually loved, because the silica made it amazing.

(Using silica is perfect! It gives just the right amount and texture of ""grit"" in the product to gently exfoliate without being harsh. And, as a HUGE added bonus, silica isn't screwing up our lakes, rivers, and oceans like polyethylene beads -- a common exfoliation  ingredient in facial cleansers that is coming under increasing scrutiny for its down-stream environmental effects.)

Imagine my surprise and disappointment, then, when I received this FULL-SIZE bottle of Billy Jealousy LIquidSand Exfoliating Facial Cleanser and saw that it doesn't use silica -- it uses polyethylene, just like everyone else. And it makes the product worse. It's now actually less effective than many other (cheaper) facial cleansers out there using polyethylene.

I specifically bought this product because the samples that Billy Jealousy gives away use silica. I bought it for the silica, but all I got was lousy polyethylene instead.

I'll never buy their products again.",0
"Used this yesterday and it has brought me out in a rash all over my face. It stung as I put it on but this calmed down, after washing off I was left its an intense burning sensation which is still with me 24 hours later.",0
"Does not work. At all. It smells like harsh chemicals, burns and literally does nothing.",0
Does absolutely nothing!,0
Have a problem with flaking. This sure doesn't flake and your hair stays in place all day,1
This is a great product and so worth the money. You use so little the tube lasts for months. My dermatologist recommended this product. I have super sensitive skin and this product is wonderful.,1
it's fine,1
"There was so much hype about this product so I had high expectations when I purchased and don't feel they were met. I don't even have acne but do get an ocassuinal cystic pimple that I just wish would shrink right away. So I expected that with this product. It does work well and does dry out pimples but that's just it, it DRIES them out. After one night I do notice pimples shrink in size a little but only a little. After two or three nights the skin becomes flakey and dry. So that's even more annoying to cover with makeup. I almost would rather leave it as is. Maybe the trick is to apply every other night. I was hoping one or two nights would practically evaporate the pimple but it just gets dry and stays. I don't think this product is worth the money.",0
"I do like how this product did not weigh down my hair, but the product left a strange waxy feeling on my hair texture, and I could see the build up. There was some kind of thick, yellowish film in my hair comb and blowdryer pik. Not sure I would buy this again, my hair quality looks nice, but I'm concerned about the waxy film in my hair and whether that build up will hurt my hair overtime.

"so expensive, but works well.",1
"Several years ago, after hearing all the hype,  I went on a T3 spree, and bought the SInglePass Flatiron, the Wet-to-Dry Flatiron, and the Featherweight Folding Dryer.  Now that I've owned each of them for 2+ years, I've concluded that it was more or less just that......hype.

For the record, I have waist length, wavy, healthy hair in great shape, and blow dry or straighten my hair several times per week.  I had heard that the T3 dryers were supposed to cut the amount of time spent blow drying, as well as cut frizz and increase shine, and I naively believed it, despite the fact that I'm a scientist and engineer.  Shame on me for not using my science power.  Let me just cut to the chase and tell you this:  if I had a time machine to go back in time, I would NOT purchase this dryer.  Here's why:
----It does NOT cut frizz.
----It does NOT significantly cut down on drying time, unless you were using some antiquated method of drying your hair previously.
----It does NOT increase shine.

I got suckered into the marketing claims, which was foolish of me, because putting my Science Police hat on, I can tell you that the only factors that really count in your hair dryer are: power and air flow.  Anything around 1800 watts should be able to produce good heat levels, and the heat is then transferred to your hair/water/air with the blower.  Ceramic or tourmaline heating elements have almost NO IMPACT on a hair dryer, because it doesn't matter whether the heating elements heat up evenly or not, since they don't transfer heat by conduction.  They only transfer heat by blowing air.  A hair dryer with a metal heating element and one with a ceramic heating element perform the same from your hair's perspective.

As for the ionic claims, well....there is scant data, and little credible scientific evidence to prove that the effect of ions on the water droplets in your hair would have any significant measurable effect.  Personally, I had hoped that the dryer would cut my drying time in half, saving me 8-10 minutes.  In reality, I found that my drying time stayed exactly the same (16-20 minutes) and there was absolutely no change whatsoever in frizz reduction or shine increase.  Granted, my hair is naturally very shiny, so that wasn't a dealbreaker for me.

What I liked about it:
----It is a little bit lighter than my other folding hair dryer, but not significantly so.  However, it does take up slightly less storage space in a drawer or under-sink cabinet area.
----The barrel and nozzle of the hair dryer are a little bit shorter than a normal hair dryer, which makes it a lot more comfortable to hold 8-10 inches from the head, especially for those of us with short arms.

As a folding dryer alone, this performs fine, but is not even remotely worth the $150 price tag, considering that it does not deliver on the frizz, shine, and drying time promises.  If you want my recommendation, the best hair dryer in the %50 and under category is still the well known Conair Infinity Pro.  In fact, that's the one that I'm using right now as my primary hair dryer, even though the T3 is sitting right next to it in the drawer.

I hope this helps someone make an informed decision.  Don't believe all the hype you read.  I wouldn't repurchase this again in the future, as it doesn't perform any better than any other 1800+ watt compact dryer on the market.",0

"Very matte instead of creamy.  A little hard to know if you get enough on as it blends in fast.  This is the only sunscreen I've found that I don't get an allergic reaction to. I also love that it doesn't have much, if any, smell.",1
It smells nice but I'm not sure what it really does. I like to use it to set my makeup when my skin is too dry for powder. Took off one star because it doesn't spray that well.. should be more like a mist but in this bottle I just get big drops on my face.,1
Didn't do anything special for my hair.,0
"This straightener has a variety of heat settings until 420. Takes about 1-2 minutes to fully heat up. The 1.5 inch plates allow you to straighten your hair quickly. The outside of the plates do get hot, so you have to be careful. Overall though, a great product for its price.",1

"This is super cool looking however it leeks and it's very hard to get a spray perfume into the funnel. I put an o-ring around the screw on sprayer and that stopped the leek.

Best product I have used for this purpose. The downside is that it is now gone up in price so much that I'm looking for an alternative.,1
The file in the set is great.  For me the tweezers are merely OK as I don't find them that easy to use.  And the clippers took me awhile to figure out but when I finally did they are very sharp.  I like the convenient and expensive looking pouch the three implements are stored in.  This could make a nice Father's Day or other occasion gift for a man for some one wanting to spend the rather hefty price.,1
Really helps with reducing  brassy hair!,1
"I am a fan of Mario Badescu products.  I have recommended them to clients with skin sensitivities and in most cases they have been very happy with their performance.  Once in a while, however, I come across a product which I am not as fond of.  This, unfortunately, happens to be one of them.

WHAT IS THIS CLEANSER LIKE?
A nice sized bottle, I do like the color of the cleanser.  It reminds me of pistachio ice cream.  The texture of the cleanser is very creamy and thick.  It has tiny flecks of dark green in it which is the seaweed.  The fragrance is a touch overwhelming for me, however.  I am not sure what it is.  It just is not a smell that I enjoy a whole lot.  The label stays on and does not come off like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mario-Badescu-The-Moisture-Magnet-SPF-15-2-oz/dp/B0015Z532O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mario Badescu The Moisture Magnet SPF 15, 2 oz.</a>.

HOW DOES THIS CLEANSING SOAP PERFORM?
A little goes  along way of this stuff.  It is thick and creamy and a delightful green color.  The cream smears around on the skin nicely and when adding a little bit of water to it, it does foam up some, but is not really sudsy like some soaps can be.  It does make skin soft at first, but then I feel as if the skin is too stripped.  The time that I am testing this in is a time of humidity and more oiliness and this cleanser is stripping my skin already- in winter, I am thinking it will be way too much for me to use.  I have normal to dry skin.

I have had my daughter test it.  She said it was nice at first but felt it stripped her skin a bit too much.

In both cases, the skin surface felt smooth, although dry and tight.

I have not had the men try it yet- they don't like to try new products. It is hard to pin them down.

THE WORST PART- ITCHING
The worst part about this cleanser is that it made our skin itch a bit.  Perhaps it was from drying it out so much or maybe the sodium laureth sulfate it contains, but it just makes the skin feel uncomfortable.  No matter how much lotion I apply, it does not seem to soothe this feeling entirely.

THE BOTTOM LINE
Great sized bottle, lovely texture and green color, this soap seemed promising.  Creamy and easy to use without being overly foamy, I found the fragrance to be a bit overwhelming and it left our skin stripped and a bit itchy and uncomfortable and tight.

I have given this one star.  If you have very oily skin and perhaps don't mind it being a strong cleanser, then perhaps you would like it.  For us, it really is rough on our skin and it just leaves us too uncomfortable to rate it higher than that.",0
Can't really see any difference after weeks of use. Will not repurchase again.,0

"This razor has luxury cachet, This is an attractive and well-designed precision instrument indeed. The weight and balance allows for effortless, comfortable shaves every time. I don't find it overly aggressive but very efficient and smooth for head shaves. Thus far I have only used the 39c with Derby blades, based on ""Nick Shaves'"" review, on YT. He right on, the Derby and Merkur HD slant are a perfect pairing. Derby in any other safety razor gives me poor results.  The 39c will possibly move into my number 1 position over the PPA Double Open comb.",1
Works great.  I work as a stylist and this is a great trimmer for around the ears and on the neckline.  Great price also,1
I loved it & so did a co-worker as she took it,1
Bottle too small,0
"Very moisturizing, and smells wonderful.",1
"While I do have lots of things on my skin I'd like to cover well, there is too much work involved in getting this product on in the morning - I don't have endless minutes to baby sit a product to get it on my face. It's not a liquid, so there's this little applicator to get product on, then 'warming' it on my skin. First trial, I used to much and I couldn't get it to blend in and had to wash it off. Second try with less went a bit better, but having to blend it in with tiny spots of application was a pain, and I still didn't feel like I had a smooth look. And note, the portion of the product I put into my palm to warm up didn't wash off easily with soap and water. More work and time spent I don't have in the morning. This was also much darker than I expected, I believe it was called warm beige, and it's more a rusty color and too dark for beige. At least my idea of beige...

Your mileage may vary, depending on getting a good-for-you color and with lots of time to pamper in the morning.",0
I received this yesterday. When I opened the package the jar was not sealed. Some of the product is missing. Very disappointed.,0
"I like this brand, but not this particular cream.  It didn't really absorb into my skin, but just sat on top of it feeling greasy ... while at the same time leaving my skin feeling dry.  I had to blend it with some argan oil to keep my skin from feeling dry.",0
Love love love,1
"I thought this product was a skin moisturizer, not makeup. It's too heavy and the color is too light. Would not buy again.",0
"Smells like fish, doesnt really leave the skin feeling refreshed, and I didn't see a real difference after using consistently for a few months. There are cheaper products that work far better in my opinion.",0
"I love the actual product in this container!! It works so well to make my hair last one more day!!! However, the spray nozzle has to be the WORST I have ever had. I have had not one, not two but THREE bottles (my dumb self thought maybe the first two were lemons?) that are almost full, yet they no longer work. I'm talking, one use and the next day, it's clogged beyond repair!! Please!!!! REPLACE THE SPRAY NOZZLE SO I CAN GIVE THIS 5 STARS!!!",0
No box. Look like cheap! But price no cheap!,0
amazing,1
Works great. My wife uses daily.,1
"I have used Pevonia products in the past and liked them.  However, I was looking for an eye cream.  This product is actually a serum.  So if you want a creamy product this is not the right one.  I did not use it at all once I realized what it was so can't really judge it.  Just not what I was looking for.  I am trying out another eye cream now by Kinerase and will write about that in a while.",0
It seems like the bottle is not full. Unable to open top and bottom is hallow. I order anot6one a year ago and it was not tne same bottle. Package was not pack like store iteam,0
"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  I have a lot of hair.  It is wavy and long, but each strand is very thin.  I sprinkle a small amount of this on top, near my roots, after blow drying and before styling.  It leaves my with wonderful volume at the crown, and I can use much less hairspray.",1
Works well.,1
After having my hair dyed blonder it always gets to feeling sort of like hay... A couple squirts of this when I get out of the shower and my hair is instantly back to it original texture...smooth and silky!! I highly recommend this product.. Its not expensive but it works like it is!,1
"I am loving this palette. The quality of the shadows are nice, they are very pigmented. The shadows wear well, stay all day. Recemend this palette.",1
This smell really good feels really good,1
Does not cover well - 2 coats is not enough.  My old Opi covers much better.,0
"I'm normally a fan of the more solid concealers in stick or pot form since I can get heavy controlled coverage with those to hide the deep dark circles I've been getting under my eyes for the last year or two.  This was the first liquid concealer I've tried in a very long time that didn't become virtually translucent after patting it onto the spots I'm trying to hide.  It stayed nice and opaque and even after dabbing my liquid foundation over it, kept a nice bright base.  I was really pleasantly surprised by the results and since it is so smooth and creamy, I don't worry as much about tugging at that delicate under eye area to get coverage.",1
"don't buy from guessing at the shades. the one that i bought was way too light. the descriptions should break the choices up into categories of fair, medium, dark or something like that.",0
"This is a great smelling product however, you are told the shipping is no longer than 7 to 10 days. When in reality it is 3 weeks.",0
"Nice, long file area. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is that I like the one from Classy Lady more because that one comes with a case.",1
I am pretty sure this was not authentic. The normal product is a pinkish gel and this product is yellow.  The indredence are not the same as my other bottle either. I am bummed. This is not a cheap product.,0
Medium Brown is almost charcoal.  Way too dark.,0
Best body wash I have ever purchased. Highly recommend this.,1
"This is not what I would call a ""day cream""--that implies a moisturizer for day time, vs., say a night cream--a thicker, less makeup-friendly glop. A day cream would provide, typically, moisture that won't cause makeup to smudge or cake in wrinkles, a sunscreen of 30 spf or more, and some nice skin care ingredients--antioxidants in particular, which are needed to counteract sun exposure. This is not most of those things. It is a nice serum-primer. It has antioxidants, as well as some nice repairing ingredients like ceramides and peptides (as opposed to resurfacing kinds of ingredients like retinol and AHAs and BHAs--fair enough--the first two can be an issue with sun exposure, anyway.). You would want to wear this on cleansed skin, but you might want to add a moisturizer over it before using a sunscreen. The TIZO primer and the various sunscreens are excellent.
Just don't expect this to be a day cream.",1
"sent me the wrong mask. i ordered the drying mask and received the flower and tonic mask instead. good mask, but not the one i ordered.",0
"Did not heat as I expected, and very heavy.",0
"This lotion is a little heavy. I use it when my skin is especially dry but not every day. I like it because it is not full of glycerin. Too much glycerin irritates my skin. The scent is OK, nothing special.",1
Not the same as other Moroccanoil Dry Shampoo I have purchased on Amazon.  Smells bad and does not do the job.  Not original.,0
It did not heat up.  I had it all the way to 430 degrees and it was not as hot as 330 on my old iron.,0
"Amazing.  Have not found anything better.  Gives even fine thin hair volume.  Expensive but
last me about six months.",1
"I don't recommend this product it's not worth the money. The lotion is very bad  ... and cleaning the machine too.
My advice save the money and get a better  machine. ;)",0
Does not stay on your nails does chip even when using a UV light not a professional polish,0
"I've been using the mousse for a couple of years and love, but this lotion just did not work for me. It smells terribly strong and takes forever to dry. I gave away half the bottle and will not repurchase.",0
"A really nice, crisp, clean scent.  Most guys would feel comfortable using this product.",1
Love this product. I have thinning hair and it has really helped me to keep my hair.,1
"I really didn't care for this product as much as all the other Vital C products I have tried. I like the Image Ormedic Facial Cleanser much better, a little goes along way. One bottle lasted me just over 3 months.",0
Excellent product.,1
All of the reviews I read said this blended super easy and gave a beautiful bronzed glow with no need for foundation or tinted moisturizer.  I was so excited to use this product and it was a total let down.  It did not blend easily and it had a red hue to it.  I was completely unsatisfied with this product and would never buy it again.,0
"My wife came out in a terrible rash all over her face the morning after she used it before going to bed. Her face is all red and feels like it's on fire a week later.  The cream smells nice but according to her dermatologist, the scent may have been the cause of her allergic reaction. The dermatologist advised against using any scented moisturizing creams and go with simple Aquaphor, Nivea or Eucerin instead.",0
woderfull product.,1
"This stuff is great.  I use it on my sensitive skin and on my toddler's eczema-prone skin.  It's pretty thin, but plenty moisturizing.  It's also a bit greasy for awhile.  I prefer the lipid replenishing cream, which is amazing.",1
"i use this soap all the time and nothing else i keep this soap in stock for myself, the least thing is that i wish the price was more reasonable!",1
Way too thick.  We struggle just to get it out of the tube.  So hard to apply and rub in.  Badger Sunscreen sport in tangerine is much better.,0
Great product.,1
"This came already used- if it wasn't opened and used, it would be a great product!",0
"I have gone through the initial 4 treatments.  After the very first use I saw a reduction in the amount of hair that returned on my arms and legs. It actually performed better than I had dared to hope for on that 1st treatment of m arms and legs.  I have a few hairs on my face that I had hoped it would get rid of, but after 4 treatments I can't tell any difference in my facial hair, but it is already sparse and fairly fine.  The hair coming back on my arms and legs is more sparse and doesn't come back very quickly.  A week after treatment I had to look carefully at my legs to see if I thought I needed to shave.  I decided that I did, but it was not as thick and only as long as it usually is after about 2 or 3 days.  I do have fair skin and medium brown hair so it is a good combination for optimal results I guess.  I haven't seen any real noticeable improvements with the subsequent treatments (2-4), but after a treatment it looks pretty good for a week afterward, so it remains slower coming back than shaving.  I am happy with my purchase so far.
I am disappointed with t he life of the lamp cartridges.  It advertised that there were 7000-10,000 flashes per cartridge.  By my estimation there are probably between 2000-3000 flashes.  I figured this after counting the number of flashes in a few sample areas and multiplying those by the numbers of areas that  were similar.  It should be a fairly accurate estimate. I was able to treat my face armpits, top of my forearms and legs all once and my face armpits and one forearm on the 2nd treatment with a cartridge.  When one cartridge ""burned out"" after just that much use I began the 2nd cartridge and counted flashes in sample areas, to see if maybe it really was using 7000-10,000 flashes to cover by body, but it really wasn't and the 2nd cartridge ""burned out"" before I finished a 3rd treatment.  Luckily I had ordered a replacement after the 1st one burned out and it was here to finished my 3rd treatment and do a 4th treatment.  Anyway it wasn't just one ""poor"" cartridge.  It appears that they really only do have about 1/3 of the advertised life.  If I find that my latest replacement lasts longer than anticipated I'll amend  this.",1
"I wanted to like this. It was impossible. I tried three times over a week - then left for three days on a mini vacay. Imagine my sadness to come home and find the smell had lingered. I really wanted to like it. There is no smell of sandalwood that I can detect, only the scent of old, tired perfume Grandma should have thrown out ten years ago.",0
received on time but the hinge that holds the lid on was broken. rollers work fine but you will need a lot more if your hair is very thick and long. did not send back because I didn't want the hassle.,0
"I have used this product for some time and it works well.  That said, I ordered this for the first time from Amazon and discovered that both of the cans had defective nozzles and would not spray.  My problem is that I didn't try either can until the return period had expired.  It seems Amazon does not stand behind the products it sells.  Looking at the reviews it appears this is a recurring problem.  After this experience I am seriously considering cancellation of my prime membership.",0
"I'm somewhat new to safety razors.  Based on the positive reviews, my first acquisition was a Merkur 34C.  It's a very good razor, but for me (I have long fingers), I felt the handle was a little too short and stubby and had a hard time grabbing it securely.  So I decided to buy this one with the longer handle (23C).  My only complaint is that the 23C has a thinner diameter handle, so although it's long enough, it still doesn't feel exactly right. If it was the thickness of the 34C, I think it would've been perfect.",1
Great product- just wish there was a discount of some sort.,1
nice product.,1
LOVE this color. It actually is the same color as the picture on the computer which was thrilling and shocking.,1
Bought this flat iron august 30th 2017 as a replacement for my last one. Great iron. But like my old one you plug it in and it turns on and it doesnt heat up anymore. Unless you want to buy a new one every six months I suggest you don't buy this..!!,0
Really good. I got it when I was pregnant - I used every day twice a day since my 4 month of pregnancy. I don't have any stretch marks:) The only think I don't like it- it is kind of sticky. I guess becouse it is gel.,1
"Really helps in calming the breakouts , doesnt dry them completely but makes them less inflamed!",1
"We took this product for our salon. We were looking for bigger volum of base coat and I found in describtion that this is 4 oz volum. But we recived only 0,5 oz regular one.",0
"Excellent product for curls and well worth the money. I have used so many different products for curly hair but this one is the best by far. Big bouncy curls, fullness without sticky residue, and lasting curls. A must buy if you wear your hair curly.",1
"CUSTOMER BEWARE. IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCT YOU CAN NOT RETURN OR GET A REFUND...This product is terrible. It does not work as described. It is thin and watery. I would say a $2.99 cover up stick from a drug store works just as well. I tried to return to Seller, but they will will not give a refund on this product. Amazon is not helping either. Just flushed 37.50 down the drain.",0
"Didn't have quite the hold that the last bottle had of the same stuff, but still a fantastic value and great product for making your hair look natural!",1
It worked Ok in the first 5 uses and the it just fell apart till it died. When working heat in the bonnet was not equally distributed.,0
The scent is very overwhelming and too strong to use on my hands. I have been using it on my feet but don't notice much difference between this lotion and a much cheaper brand.,0
works better than any I've tried. great for under-eye circles. great for rosacea. long lasting (one application for whole day),1
I really like the richness but my face feels slightly dry after using it.,1
They don't have charger,0
"My hair felt moisturized and silkier. Great leave in for blow outs on African American natural hair. Pricey, but would buy again.",1
Best for when I'm going to straighten my hair,1
The deodorant doesn't last very long. It smells ok. It is over price because the brand. I don't recommend it.,0
"Package arrived broken with gold powder all over. I did my best to fix the top, but product still doesn't apply evenly and leaks.",0
"This is by far one of the worst thermal heat sprays I have ever used it leaves your hair extremely sticky and make its tangle VERY easily save your self the money and buy anything else! My experience  with this product is comparable to taking a  two dollar bottle of suave pump hairspray and spraying it all over my hair. I much prefer the $5 tresemme product I found at Walmart, it leaves my hair soft and silky and unlike the Lanza brand it contains no ALCOHOL, which fries your hair!!! Don't waste your money if I could rate no stars I would!!!!!!!",0
used to love this curling iron.  Bought this one the end of April 2017 and now you have to play with the cord for it to work.  I only use it about 3 to 4 time a week.,0
"Only gave two stars, while I loved this flat iron, and made my hair very soft and shiny, it broke within one year ",0
I liked this box a lot it was well packed with nice paper in the box ... the sample sizes are fun and the right size to see what you like,1
Doesn't moisturize enough.,0
it was a little liquid-y when it arrived but it in freezer and it was fine. The scent is a little strong,1
i use this together with the body wash in shower. not greasy but it helps my dry skin,1
Not worth it.,0
"This review is for the seller: DiscountsJungle.  I believe in the time I ordered this and posted my review the seller has changed.  I believe this review is still beneficial:

I received the product within the given timeframe and was excited to try it out.  It arrived in the corret box and included a little heat mat and a nice comb (which I was not expecting so that was a plus).  Unfortunately my excitement quickly faded as I realized that there was a 1"" scratch in the top of the flat iron, it is so deep you could almost consider it a gouge.  When turning it over for a little more inspection I realized that there is a scratch on one of the plates.  When I saw these scratches my first thought was ""isn't this supposed to be new?""

As mentioned in a prior review, this product does not include the serial number so you can take advantage of the warranty offered by T3.  So again, I have to question whether this is a new product.  The ironic thing about it is that they include a warranty card in the box! It specifically says in the ""Limited Warranty Form"" that is in the box: ""THIS LIMITED WARRANTY IS ONLY VALID IF THE ORIGINAL SERIAL NUMBERS ON THE PRODUCT HAVE NOT BEEN REMOVED OR OTHERWISE TAMPERED WITH"". On the box there is a comment that the product should have a sticker on it with the serial number for warranty purposes and mentions that if it does not have this that the product is assumed to have been altered by a non-authorized seller. All of this is conveniently next to a blank white box (I assume a sticker with the serial number is supposed to go there). I can only assume that the big scratch on this product is where the sticker was and they took a knife or something and scraped it off.

Besides the cosmetic issues I have been pleased with the performance of the flat iron. It heats up fast, flashes until it is at the desired temperature and when I turn the heat down for more delicate hairs (bangs) it does blink notifying me that it is too hot as it adjusts to the lower temperature.

Given the issues that Julie posted on 7/25/2011, I am not going to even try to tackle the issues regarding the warranty. It was under $100, so I will see how long it will hold up for. When it comes time to replace this one I will be sure to pay for it at full price at a retail store who is a confirmed authorized seller of T3 flat irons.",0
"My daughter is really into makeup. She is excellent at doing things like wings and cut creases and all the stuff they do on those youtube tutorials. I had her use this and give me her impressions. She used the ""linen"" on her very light skin. She and I both have pinkish undertones, so this was slightly yellow on us, but most foundations are. The pictures are pretty true to color on the website, though I agree buying makeup online can be hard. She usually uses the lightest or next to lightest colors in the foundation lines, so the linen was pretty close on her. The coverage is about medium coverage when you put it on one lighter layer. She used both a beauty blender and a foundation brush, she liked the damp beauty blender better with this as it is very pigmented, a brush made it streaky. We both liked that you could build this foundation to get a heavier coverage. Sometimes when you try to put more on a problem area or something, the new layer just moves the underneath layer around or wipes it off. This could build. That is very nice if you want to cover a blemish, scar, or red marks or if you just like a more full-coverage look. I like lighter coverage and acutally mixed a little with some face cream and it worked that way, too.  She set hers with translucent, loose powder (I think it was kat von d brand) and it worked very well. A tinted powder may be too much pigment, but you can experiment to see what you like best.  We may try the ""cream"" color to give us less yellow, but this is very close. The price is very good for the heavier coverage. Will buy again.",1
I loved this product two years ago when it was in the glass jar. They have COMPLETELY changed the formula & now use a plastic tube. The product may have the same name but it is NOT the same product as before. It is horrible. I have called the company and they are very vague & unapologetic about it.,0
Truly shows signs of softened lines and nice glow with regular use. I like the lifting serum the best. Decent price. Keep in mind this is trial size,1
"I tried Derma Doctor about six months ago and followed the directions to the ""t"", and used the entire bottle, it did not make any difference for my skin. I was surprised because I actually read about it in Cosmopolitan. I was really disappointed just because it was so expensive. I'm going to try something else.",0
This has been working great so far. It has more Benzoyl Peroxide in it than Proactiv and still isn't nearly as drying. Love it.,1
not for me.,0
I gave that order about 1.5 weeks ago they said it will come on thursday  (last week) i don't know why it isn't come yet i want my money back!,0
"I don't know about the big hair because I could not get past the SMELL.  Read it was great, delicious, etc., but smells like my grandma trying to disguise a rough night in a supper club in the 60s.  Wow - not in the good sense.  I could never use this when in a confined space, such as my car, my office, my house.",0
Don't like smell . Is very heavy and feels sticky.,0
Love Stila waterproofing! It really is waterproof and does volumize. The brush is fantastic!!,1
"Previously I gave this product 1 star due to the ingredient list not matching the paraben-free designation, however I have since purchased this product and the ingredient list is NOTHING like what is listed on this page.

Either the seller used the ingredient list from another product, OR the product has been re-formulated.

The product IS now paraben free, and the ingredient list on the bottle isn't even CLOSE to the ingredients listed on this site.

This product is very light on conditioning, as you would expect a volumizing product to be, so it does not weigh down the hair.

The scent is a very natural mint scent, not a sweetened one, but more like you were walking through a patch of mint on a warm spring day.

I'm a guy with shorter hair, non-color treated/undamaged and absolutely LOVE this product for my hair.

My GF has color treated/damaged hair and finds this product to not provide enough conditioning, and uses the L'Occitane Repairing shampoo and conditioner instead.",1
Ok to be clear I have to point out that the seller was great! I received the product early and it was packaged securely. The issue I have with this polish it that it NEVER DRIES. I love essie but the formula on this one is aweful. The color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle. BUT even with one coat (I tried it out just to see if it'd dry that way) it'll smudge as soon as you touch anything. The better buy would be sinful colors endless blue!! The colors are identical and the formula's great!,0
"I wet shave every time. I've been using straight razors and safety razors (double edge) razors for years. I ordered this because their wasn't much to choose from this last time. I now wish I'd ordered a bag of cookies or something. This stuff is like a soft version of Noxzema. The smell is medicine like and the shave was not very comfortable or close, and it doesn't build a very good lather. I was going to throw it away, but my wife may give it a go on her legs in the shower. Don't waste your money on this. If you want a good shave go with Colonel Conk glycerin shave soap. It comes in several different, pleasant aromas, and gives a superior shave to any canned or tub type cremes. I almost feel violated after using this product, compared to what I'm used to. I prefer using ""Edge"" to this if you have to go the easy route. Nothing beats the lather you get from a quality shave soap once you learn the technique of how to build a good lather. This stuff took handfuls to get enough to get a less than adequate lather, and the shave was not close, and my face is raw, like I almost didn't use any lather. Might be a good cold creme for removing makeup on women, but it's lousy for removing a beard.",0
Works great.  Only flaw is that the comb pulls out of the straightener while in use.,1
My Clarisonic came with a small sample bottle of this gel cleanser and it was amazing in clearing my nose area. I generally have sensitive skin as well but this product didn't cause any issues. Smells nice too.,1
I don't know what all the fuss is about.  I used this for a few months and it did nothing.  It's oily and gross.  Went back to my old eye cream and already looking better.,0
"This product is primarily acetone.  So you may as well use just acetone.  But, DO NOT use with cotton or around pets that shed!",0
"I have moderate acne with oily, sensitive skin.  I wasn't expecting a miracle with this foundation but I am happy with the results.  It does seem to be helping my skin overall.  The foundation is light which I prefer over the heavy, cakey stuff.  My only complaint is that it doesn't control my oil problem.  Overall I would recommend this item.  It looks very natural and gives my skin a bit of a glow (glo).  I recommend going to the glominerals website to find the color that matches your skin tone.",1
The chapstick arrived broken so I was unable to retract it (make it go up and down to use) and the stick itself was unusually hard. I was very bummed and returned it.,0
Had this original one for over 5 years and loved it. This one is a little lighter but doesn't seem as powerful,1
Not the best hair fiber... Goes straits to your scalp... I have tried better brands...,0
"this is economy model it works but don't expect much chrome plating is thin handle is brass but its thin and very light razor has no weight to it

i have two edwin js and they are 3 times better than this model",0
"In a full size can the product is great, but the 1.3 oz size always arrives dried out.",0
"I bought this from Beauty brands.  I had it for less than a year.  It started smoking, then making loud noises then finally quit yesterday.  For the price I was hugely disappointed to say the least, don't waste your money!",0
"I like this shampoo, and feel it is a healthier choice  than most out there.",1
Does the job. Good color. Smells kind of like citrus. I'm not bothered by the smell.,1
I love my flat iron the best I've ever used!!!!!,1
MADE IN CHINA-READ THE FINE PRINT!,0
I would suggest buying a gray root cover-up instead at the grocery store. This product is pleasant but sprays a really big area instead of a focused area. It also runs off and was much more expensive than just buying a grey cover up for $5.,0
Amazing! I have super thick hair and this serum helps it dry faster and keep the style with my brush. I no longer need to use my flat iron for the tricky areas.,1
"Bought it for my Fiance, she said she loved it and it was worth it for the price.",1
One of my favorite Claus Porto soaps!,1
Scent is still quite strong!,0
"I used to be the biggest rep for pur minerals, especially the 4 in 1 pressed powder. Would have given it 5 stars for years. I had been wearing it in all seasons of the year for the past 3/4 years when I realized that the new compact I recently ordered was different. The packaging was different but the makeup looked/seemed the same so I put it on as usual. The first few days of wearing I noticed I was oiler and shinier than usual after a few hours of wear. I have acne scarring and some discoloration that I cover with a little foundation brush with the 4 in 1 makeup. I don't wear all over my face as I don't need it and feel less is more when it comes to sensitive skin wearing makeup all day. I finally came to the conclusion after almost a week that the new formula must be different. It was not wearing the same, and as I said before, it's was glimmery..before it was more matte which is what I loved about it. The biggest upset is that in the week I was wearing the new formula of 4 in 1, I developed cystic acne on my chin. You can never be 100% sure of cause but my cystic acne has been under control until I started using the new compact of pur minerals. I found that the new formula contains BISMUTH which is a mineral that, A: makes the makeup more 'glimmery' as i described (not a good look in my book) and B: can cause cystic acne and breakouts. So both of the things I noticed can be linked to the new formula of the 4 in 1 makeup. I am so upset that I have to look for a new concealer/foundation. Why oh why did they change the formula that was great for my skin? I didn't want to believe it but it is definitely not the same product it was when I bought it 4 years ago. Thinking about going back to dermablend as it is good matte coverage that doesn't effect my sensitive break out prone skin.",0

"I prescribed to a beauty supply deliver called ""Birchbox"". Although I'm sure they wouldn't appreciate me doing so, I always price compare when I decide I want to buy the full size (they send samples every month) between their site & Amazon. 9/10 Amazon gets me a better deal, which I think is great! Happy with my purchase. Fast shipping. Would buy again.",1
Great color and formula.,1
"I love this hair spray. It has a good hold which is does not make the hair too hard, but keeps the hair in place all day and makes it easy to comb or later in the day. The only thing I don't like is, after I spray it on my hair, there is a strong smell thats overpowering and makes it difficult to breath.",1
Very poor coverage and very streaky. The Polish has been on two days and it is already chipping. Extremely disappointed.,0
"This palette is pretty incredible. Very good color pay off, the color applies densely and is buildable. Don't need much. Amazing for the price. Good if you're just starting to learn application and technique for eyeshadows. A gentle hand is necessary though because the eyeshadows are so pigmented!",1

This product was very think with a little milky tint. Usually when I put opi nail envy on my nails they dry in less then 5 minutes and have a very shiny finish after 1 coat. Even after two coats this was dull and took forever to dry. On top of everything else my finger tips started to have a burning sensation after about an hour and I had to remove the polish.",0
"This condtioner smells wonderful and is pretty good conditioner, I just have very coarse hair and it takes a really good conditioner to calm it down",1
I have purchased several Jane Iredale products and was very happy with them.  This is another one that I am happy with also.  Love the chocolate smells first thing in the morning to start your day!,1
No I did not care for it.  It comes out of the tube a bit oily.  by the time the product comes out you waste part of it.  As far as concealing it did the same as any other concealer.,0
"Makes a superb travel razor. Rather than the ones ""designed"" as travel razors, the separating head and handle stows easily and still feels solid when assembled. Highly recommend.",1
My review of this is basically the same as the conditioner. Fragrance was way too overpowering. It dried out my hair and made my scalp itchy. Definitely not worth the money,0
"I've tried to use it for a few months, found out this thing doesn't have any positive effect at all.  It also irritates the skin. It's a piece of very expansive junk!",0
Good product. Good value,1
"I was very disappointed as the jar is usually full and this one was only 3/4 full so I'm thinking it was used and then returned.  At this price, I will think again before ordering unless they replace it",0
I really like this product and this size is perfect for travel.,1
"This is a very well made and functional brush.  Before ordering it for review I had looked at the dimensions, but wished that I could have seen it compared to something, so that is why I have included a photo.  The brush is comfortable to hold, with no real concern over it being slippery and it is extremely soft and light. Blending is very easy with it and everything considered it makes it easy to recommend this if you are looking to spend $20-$30 on one.",1
Great product. Has a nice subtle smell. A bit difficult to wash out but I guess that's expected.,1
Love it has made my skin super smooth!,1
I have purchased this product before the formulation change. I was hesitant to purchase after some people being disappointed in the new formula but gave it a try.  It disappointed me.  My hair felt dry after using the product.  I actually had some of the older formula left and definitively the older formula left my hair soft and shiny.,0
"I shave in the shower, where the light is indirect, so a razor with a light is fantastic. The razor itself is easy to hold, and easy to shift around in your hand. If you're interested, buy this one, as AoS isn't selling it any more. The new ones are chrome (read: slippery). Four stars because they make you buy all the other stuff to get the razor.",1
It's ok,0
Good product.,1
Excellent results. Very visible improvement almost  immediately. Will continue to  use the product.,1
"It has a pungent smell to it. I thought i would like it since i love the sexy hair soya want flat hair, but this was bad. It has a smell and leaves my hair sticky and not completely flat.",0
Excellent foot cream,1
"Great volume, but you loss shine and manageability -- that said, I still love the volume I get, I just have to work with my hair a little more to style it. The volume achieved it very noticable but I don't feel or see any long term damage at all.",1
"I bought this product for my 18 month olds cradle cap that was pulling out hair when it came out.  I felt it did little to nothing for the problem.  After seeking advice from the woman who cuts her older brothers' hair, and hearing how she sees a number of kids with bald spots because of untreated cradle cap, she recommended Original Sprouts Hair and Body Baby Wash.  I have been using it on her for two weeks now and the cradle cap is completely gone and disappeared without any additional hair loss.  I highly recommend it.  I noticed a difference just in the first few days of use.",0
Received item in damaged condition. There was a hole in the metal tube the product comes in. Gel that remained in tube wasn't the right consistency but I've kept it because I need it to take on vacation tomorrow!! Otherwise I'd return it. This stuff is too expensive to accept it in damaged condition. :(,0
"I loved the version for normal skin of this product but received the 'dry and sensitive' one instead. I can say I'm super disappointed with it.

The pros:
- there is just one: it makes my skin look good (not super good but not bad either, and its super rare that a product can do just that)

The cons:
- The smell is terrible. It's way too sweet and the smell of honey is way to intense
- I use this product with my Clarissonic Aria and this product makes my cheeks itch. It is not very painful and doesn't make my face red either but it still make them itch (and my boyfriend had the same issue as well).",0
I love this face wash. It gets all of my makeup off and doesn't make my sensitive skin breakout.,1
Great product!  I have been using it for several years - ever since I was given a sample.  It has done wonders for my skin and I use it daily.,1
This is not the thick lathering type of wash but still effective and much less expensive than some other brands. It is by no means the miracle cure for acne but has helped clear up my skin to some degree and I have noticed fewer breakouts.,1
Works great just leaves my face shiny,1
"I purchased this a few months ago. It worked great at first, then after two months it quit working! Not sure if mine was defective or a bad product.",0
I am very unhappy with this eye cream. It has caused the skin under and around my eyes to become red and dry and more wrinkled. I tried to give it a fair chance of 6 weeks but I was so unhappy I tried to return it. However since it had been more than 30 days Amazon wouldn't let me. Since it was so expensive I decided to try it again but I had the same problems. The skin under my eyes is actually rough feeling. I'm extremely unhappy.,0
"You can keep this liner for a long while but unfortunately this is not waterproof and is fairly easy to rub off. Color is lighter than expected and somehow gets lighter throughout the day, Not horrible but not great. Not worth the money for those with mono lids or oily eyelids.",0
Expensive; but my husband loves it.,1
This cleanser seems works great and is great for someone with oily skin. Be sure to have a moisturizer ready because your skin will need it ... in a good way.,1
"I got this for my wife for Christmas 2012.  She really liked it.  It did save her time drying her hair and she liked the temperature controls.

Her only complaint was that the on/off and temperature control switches were ""slick"" or ""slippery"" and could be difficult to move as they are flush into the handle grip of the dryer.

In April, the power switch started having issues.  Something inside isn't making good contact and she'd have to shake it or move the switch rapidly (very hard to do) back and forth to get it to power on.  I contacted their warranty service (you eventually wind up at Conair customer service in case you're wondering) to request a replacement unit and was told that I'd have to send the unit in and it would take at least 2 weeks and up to 3 weeks for repair.

My issue here is that after about $40 on a hair dryer with a faulty component the only way to get it repaired meant my wife wouldn't have a hair dryer for 2-3 weeks.  That pretty much means I'm buying my wife a new hair dryer because she's not going to go a couple of weeks without one.  It seems to be sort of a stupid warranty policy for something like this.  I escalated past the first 3 levels of polite, but unaccommodating service reps and finally got a supervisor who was not as polite and pretty much told me that having to buy a new hair dryer while waiting for repair of this one wasn't his problem and that he was upset that I'd forced his employees to bring this issue to him.

Needless to say, we won't be buying anything from BaByliss or ConAir again.",0
I bought this for my son for Christmas. He likes the way it makes his face feels before shaving. He doen't get razor burn or chaffing of his skin.,1
"I just had this product sent to my mother along with the hand lotion, but she insists it's DISH SOAP!I told her I didn't send her $22 dish soap. I cannot see the product for myself, so does anyone have a clue as to what this really is? My mom cannot send me an image.",0
Good value,1
"I love Essie nail polish...but this color itself is only SLIGHTLY different than ""Butler, Please"". I purchased this in the store, and it appeared more purple under the lights which was what I was looking for. I put on a layer of ""Butler, Please"" on one nail and this on the next one. BARELY any difference. Still a pretty color but just be aware that it is just like this color. Now I have two of the same basically.",0
was too sheer for me.,0
"Smells great, my husband loves this stuff",1
"I received a set of these as a gift and a though all of the colors were pretty, it felt like having sticky glue on my lips. Do not recommend if you want a smooth non-sticky feeling. It's a gloss that you manually click up onto the brush, I suggest one click at a time. It seemed like nothing was coming up and then all of a sudden a big blob plopped out. I like other Stila products but not this",0
"So far, no results, starting month 4",0
Does not work and STINGS your eyes.  Complete waste of money,0
"I have owned 3 Hot Tools curling irons over the past 2-3 years. After I first purchased a curling iron from this brand I loved it! It worked really well with my type of hair (very thick and somewhat coarse), so much so that I decided to buy another one in a different barrel size. Unfortunately after owning my first iron for about a year (using it numerous times) it started to short circuit and would turn on and off on it's own while using it. Due to the reasonable price and how much I used the iron I decided to replace it about 1 month ago (on Amazon). Now, after having it for 1 month and only using it 2-3 times it has completely stopped working. I plug the curling iron in and although the indicator light comes on signaling it's ""on"" it doesn't heat up! Just contacted Amazon today and I will be returning the curling iron. Seems like this brand has an issue with the electrical. Sadly looking for other brands now as I don't want to risk purchasing another faulty iron.",0
It works and is not flakey but doesn't get as hard as the bottle I bought at the salon.,0
"It does NOTHING!  I finished the product brought from Europe, so I thought there are the same standards within the brand, I was wrong! After couple of hours I could smell my sweat, I could not believe it! West of the money !!!",0
This doesn't behave or smell like what I'm used to using???,0
"Yes, I love it!!!!!!!  Thank you!!!",1
Was a gift to a friend that won't use anything else.  Must be good!!!,1
The product appeared to not be a full contained.  I have been using for almost three weeks and see no change.  I will give it a few more weeks if there is anything left in the tube to see if it actually works.  After that time I ay change my rating.  Currently I am disappointed.,0
I hope that this product is NEVER discontinued because I love it.  It smells divine and leaves my curls shiny and soft.,1
"Loved the idea, but I never saw much difference if any. I would not recommend this product and will not be buying it again.",0
I was excited to try this since it is smudge & waterproof.  It is smudge proof provided it doesn't get wet.  Since it washes off with water if you sweat & rub your eyes off it comes.  Additionally it does nothing in the way of thickening & since it dries quickly you really can't get good lengthening either.  This mascara really does not perform as promised.,0
"Do not try to color match off your screen! For me that has never worked. I know my shade due to trial and error.
This shade is suited towards yellow undertones. I'll include what shades I am in other brands below. I find Sephora's Color IQ shade matcher to be pretty helpful when trying new brands.

For me, this powder looks more airbrushed when applied with a Kabuki brush. Not as good with sponges. Do NOT get it wet on your facewhen applying it or it darkens and looks terrible. For this reason I do not recommend using with a liquid concealer until it has fully dried on you. It's pretty good in terms of not making me break out.

I am a Medium Dark in this line. Toffee in Becca's foundation.  Tan Honey in Tarte's Shape Tape Foundation. Honey Beige in Dream Matte Mousse.",1
This color was way too dark,0
Keep in mind that this is not a flat iron. Its great for adding body and anything out your second day blowout. It does curl with a bit of practice. I used this on a cruise and it did very well to flatten my puffy hair.,1

Very stiff and hard on skin.,0
"All these high priced hair treatments including the high priced Moroccan oil are nothing but cheap silicone filled garbage.  Yes, they make your hair feel soft and shiny, but a day or two later, you have greasy silicone build up which is a pain to get rid of. Do your research before buying.",0
Chipped after 3 d as ys,0
Purchased for my mother who doesn't order on line. She was very happy I was able to find this product for her. She was happy with the price.,1
"Crabtree & Evelyn have discontinued this scent in a lot of their products, shampoo, conditioner, etc... I'm sad about that as it's one of my favorite scents. I actually use this in shower/tub... but it would work as hand wash, of course! It's hard to describe the scent... the best I can say is that it is slightly woodsy?  I like light, clean scents and this is perfect for me.  But everyone likes something different.  Would be five stars if the price was more reasonable.  *sigh*  I always update if there are any issues.",1
"Bought in January 2013.  It is now 4 months later and I went to turn it on this morning, and it wouldn't heat up.  Tried different outlets and nothing.  Just quit on me.  It was used maybe 4 times a week for maybe 5 minutes at a time.  Unfortunately, I cannot return since its past its window and wouldn't be able to anyway since I believe I threw out the original packaging (lesson learned).  I'm assuming I was just unlucky and received a defective one out of the bunch because I know this is a good curling iron.  Worked very well during its short life.  What a bummer.",0
"This eye shadow is a lot more sheer than I thought it would be. All the colors are matte and give a very light wash of color. I use this on very natural days just to even out my eyelids and give very very slight definition. I prefer satin finishes, but for the ingredients in this trio, it's not terrible. The shadows don't feel buttery by any stretch of the imagination. They feel more powdery. I would recommend tarte's eye shadows. They are more buttery and pigmented. Physician's Formula shimmer strips are also nice and shimmery. The nude collections are great.",1
"I love this color!! & I love ZOYA polish!!! The color is awesome...not really purple....but a mauvey-pinky...purple that shines with lots of color & depth....only needed 2 coats & stayed on without chipping for a week!  Thats why I love Zoya poilsh...great pigmantation & long wearing:)
Would recommend to anyone who loves color & polish!",1
"Father loves the product, the competition can't top this product.",1
Helps my hair feeling soft.,1
"I'm really disappointed in this product. It gets rave reviews. Not just on amazon but on the web. I think it may have won some awards & was definitely listed in several best top 10 beauty products. I have very long hair & I just wanted something to make my hair shiny. This didn't do anything at all. Citre-shine works better.

You might as well be putting plain water in your hair. It had no effect. It made my hands shiny upon application but that sadly didn't transfer to my hair.",0
"Love Supersmile, but NOT the fluoride free. Left a daily film on my teeth.  Threw it away!",0
"My son loves this scent.  I like it too.

Euphoria is a great name for this scent. It has a pungent fresh tang to it which I like. Here's how the company describes the 'notes' in the scent (I'm not sure what 'creamy suede' or 'raindrop accord' smells like but it sounds good):

'This fresh oriental fragrance blends crisp, modern freshness and aromatic spices with a sexy, creamy signature. Top Notes: ginger pepper cocktail, raindrop accord, chilled sudachi Middle Notes: black basil, sage and cedar leaf Base Notes: amber, patchouli, Brazilian redwood and creamy suede.'",1
"The 1 1/4 inch version of this curling iron is great, but for some reason the 1 1/2 version doesn't heat up as well or hold a curl whatsoever. Had to toss it.",0
"Great! A moisturizing, tinted, mineral sun protector that doubles as make-up--what could be better! I have average skin and the medium tint works fine. I don't find the fragrance offensive at all. If anything, it reminds me of all the wonderful things I'm getting in one package. I am not a person to spend ages making up my face with layers of this and that, so, I am especially appreciative of this 'all-in-one'. Living in New Mexico at a high altitude with almost constant sunshine, having a natural sunscreen is something I take very seriously. I also use non-tinted Juice Beauty for the other areas.",1
It worked for 1 month then stopped. Im now out $120,0
Not impressed.,0
"May dry out skin if not kept moisturized or used too much but works great to prevent acne. I may take a day or two break from using this product and only use my feminine wash or apple cidar vinegar on my face; then if I notice a break out pop into place I use this product, and it clears right away.",1
I have seen zero results,0
Total scam product!,0
I've been purchasing this monthly ever since I have tried it. And will continue to do so in the future.,1
"It's a great moisturizer. If you have oily skin and want a moisturizer that actually moisturizes and keeps the shine under control, this is the product for you! Doesn't clog my pores either and it works well under makeup. It's a light moisturizer for those of you who are curious.",1
This is a fairly quiet hair dryer. It's a little overpriced but is of good quality. Less expensive hair dryers only last about 2 years. This one has a 5 year warranty.,1
"This stuff is great. My wife got it for me, as I was always using her argon oil. I like this stuff better, and now my wife is using this too! Smell is soft and really nice, it feels amazing, my skin drinks it in.",1
"Not crazy about the scent, but I like how it creams on the face. A little dab will do ya so it lasts a long time.",1
The product arrived half empty!,0
"They came in their foil packets but were not in a box as I expected them to be. I was accustomed to buying a box and these were not in a box. I do love these towelettes, however.",1
Made my skin breakout SO bad!!!  I got these little pimples all over my forehead and then the next couple of days they had started in on my cheeks! I know this product was the culprit because it was the only thing I added to my regimen. I don't know how this got so many good reviews -  I just don't know.....Maybe it's the minerals... anyway now I use supergoop and I haven't broken out once!,0
I am darker skinned and the color is just right.  I received a compliment the very first day I used it.,1
Love the product and saving money,1
"I have been growing more and more desperate over my thinning hair, to the point, apparently, of total stupidity. The proof of that is the money I wasted on this product. Reviewers advised me to order a shade lighter than my hair, so I ordered light blonde. Unfortunately, light blonde is the exact same color as my scalp, so the powder did absolutely nothing for me other than rain all over the counter, and my shirt, and make me sneeze! If it weren't so overpriced for what is essentially colored talcum powder, I might be sucker enough to buy a shade or two darker than my light blonde hair and try again. But, times being what they are, I'm going to give it a pass.",0
its just ok,0
"I am really really really upset!

I bought this Babybliss Curling Iron in June, because I saw a review on a YouTube Channel. I paid with my visa.
Well, I am from Germany. Here in Europe and especially in Germany it is not allowed to use electrical appliances from the USA, IF they don't have the right volt. So, I got a letter from the local custom office in August. I had to go there and they told me, that I can not use this Curling Iron, because on the packaging was not the CE-approval

(The CE marking indicates the compliance with EU legislation of a product, wherever in the world manufactured, and enables its free movement within the European market. By affixing the CE marking on a product, a manufacturer is declaring, at its sole responsibility, conformity with all of the legal requirements to achieve CE marking which allows free movement and sale of the product throughout the European Economic Area.)

So I had no choice. The custom office sended the item back to the seller. I really didn't know that and wrote on the next day to the seller about that. They answered really quick and told my that the didn't know that, too. Well, okay bad luck.
BUT since than I didn't get my money back! Every month I write to the seller, if the item is there or not, and he always says no. Well, four months later, I really can not believe him anymore. It is a lot of money for me and I really want it back...",0
"This product lathers well, however it has a masculine scent and it's really strong...",0
This is a nice little moisturizer for the lips.  A nice little hint of color.  I was happy with my purchase.,1
"It's ok. It does not rip your face off the way the girl in the video filmed it. We had several family members try it here too and not one had an issue. It was really easy to get off. We tried it thin, heavy-- all the same results without pain. I actually wanted the rip off factor. I don't know if they changed the formula or what or if that girl had a crazy hairy face...",0
doesn't do what it say.,0
"I have terribly dry skin, so dry it often flakes. I've tried a lot of moisturizers over the years, recently converting from Olay Regenerist to EltaMD. The EltaMD is thinner and lighter and absorbs faster than my Olay product ever did, which means I'm not waiting forever before applying makeup. I specifically was searching for a non-sunscreen daytime moisturizer, which is really hard to find, so this was a great find. After using it for a few weeks, my skin has felt softer and healthier with no flaking. This is amazing considering the -40+ wind chills lately and constantly blowing central heat in the house, fireplace burning, etc. All that and still my skin is moist and smooth!

I'm totally converted to EltaMD and ready to try the PM moisturizer, sunscreen, and lip protection now. I only wish they had a retinol product to try! If you have sensitive, super dry skin, this moisturizer is well worth a try!",1
"I loved Lorac's Creamy Brow pencil. It was discontinued and replaced by the Pro Brow pencil. This is an inferior product, and certainly not an improvement. If you have super thick brows and want a touch of defining this might work for you. Color is not as good of a match, takes a lot of application to get the right color, is greasy and fades quickly.",0
Absolutely love this product - just wish it wasn't so expensive.,1
It was NOT THE COLOR SHOWN NOR WHAT I expected...its a brown/gray,0
"Very hard to get the product out of the bottles once you put it in unless it is VERY thin, and a few of the items are useless.",0
"Pretty good stuff. Minty smell is nice. Lather takes a bit at first to get from the soap as it is a hard soap (picture makes it appear to be a soft cream) and it takes either a stiffer boar brush or just a lot more water to soften it initially, after that any brush whips up a nice creamy lather. It's quite a nice thick lather too.",1
Came in like 5 days. Just used it today!!,0
I never received the product.  I was notified that it was back-ordered but not notified when it went past the late date.  I had to call and deal with too many people.  I finally got a refund but it was a hassle.,0
Im giving it 1 star because I used it with the acne facial wash and my skin was burned. It created scabs on my face. But Im not sure whether this product contributed to it or if was just the wash. I returned them both just in case.,0
"The item I purchased was supposed to be NEW in box, however it had grease on the Silk'n Silk'n SensEpil and it was not in any retail packaging,  i.e. clear plastic bags over accessories, etc.  I contacted the seller about this product ""make me heal""  and was eventually able to return the item with a RM #  I never received credit from them and phone calls were not received by me,  so I contacted Discover and was given a credit for this item.  Make me heal return process was very very inadequate and slow.  I ups the item to insure delivery and provided that information to the credit card company which issued my refund for the item.  Please read the item description to make sure your not getting a remanufactured or refurbished item.  It was for a Birthday present or I would have probably kept the item as the concept of hair removal is appealing,  however item that arrived was not giftable.  Good Luck!",0
nothing come out.. for this price ? should be working correctly..don't waste money,0
"Nothing great, not worth it",0
"this product, as several reviewers note, is an update from an original product that I used to have years ago.  I was hoping this would work, it doesn't work for me.",0
I took the suggestion of another reviewer and only puncture two of the little dispenser holes.  That gives just enough glow  Perfect product.,1
Does not seem as thick as the old kind in the metal tube but pretty good.,1
Great subtle scent that lingers with you through the morning. Use this and it will really cut down on the number of cuts and help compensate for amateur shaving technique. Knocked a star off because it is a little expensive for what it is.,1
"""Pearl of Wisdom"" color goes on streaky and irregular, their other colors are better at this.  Very unhappy with this",0
like it,1
"I love this blow dryer. I use it at the barbershop I work at 5 days a week. Has great blowing power and a long cord. For the price, you cant beat the quality!",1
works,1
"This product does not remove makeup, dirt, or any other impurities!!! I've used it with a sponge and a facial brush and a film is still left behind. After I wash my face, I use a toner. The cotton pad is always covered in grime after I use this cleanser. As for the exfoliation, it is nonexistent. The only thing I like about this product is the scent.",0
very good,1
"I think I like this. My only gripe is that it doesn't feel as if it hydrates much. As a matter of fact, I feel as though my skin feels even more dry. I don't know, I'm going to give it more time before I finalize a complete review.",1
"Have to scrub way to hard, hard on the eye area. It does work though.",1
"This product was NOT as smooth and creamy as the product we sampled at our condo, in Hawaii.  Disappointed....especially for the price.  Yikes!",0
"I liked the power, heat, and weight of this hairdryer. Unfortunately, it suddenly stopped working after 11 months. I don't expect an appliance like a hairdryer to have a long lifespan, but less than one year is unacceptable. It seems the company honors its warranty, and the dryer is very nice for the price, but I've decided to move on to a different brand.",0
"I liked the color,very neutral. The polish didn't seem very new because the color separated quickly.",0
love this stuff!  best I have found yet.,1
Great product but the shipping was awful--I won't do it again. The top was 1) boken; the stuff was 2) spilled; and it was missing 3) the pump.,0
"Maybe it's because I'm so used to liquid foundation, but I found this to be very cakey. It didn't go on smooth at all. The makeup quickly settled into my pores and it was very easy to rub some off onto my shirt, hand, etc. As for coverage, blemishes were covered but the makeup kind of piled up around spots and made it obvious that I was covering something.",0
"For this tiny (I mean tiny) bottle at $30/bottle - I expected to have my mind blown. Well it wasn't and I actually like my ""Pillow proof"" dry shampoo better. Don't buy unless you like overspending for no reason...",0
I previously had bought this product at my salon for almost 3 times what I paid for on Amazon...product is wonderful for my hair.,1
It broke already!  I am so disappointed.,0
"Doesnt set up with a UV light, even after 4 mins!!!! Description said UV or LED....not very happy",0
don't like it,0
"The photo -- a cross between pink, salmon and red -- captures the color accurately on both of my monitors). Even though the photo reflects the color, the description could be more specific as I wasn't sure what it'd look like before seeing it. Shade 03 doesn't say much!

It doesn't take too much to apply the right amount. My skin color is fair and it works. I don't have skin issues, so I can't speak to whether it would work for those who have sensitive skin.

While the artistic cover looks lovely, I'd rather have a bland cover and spend less than have a fancy one that may drive up the cost. The compact size should be a good fit for small purses. However, because it doesn't come with a brush -- which is just as well because those little brushes are useless -- you'd have to add one. The color didn't last all day for me despite my spending the entire day indoors.

If you have unanswered questions, please comment so I help you decide whether this is for you.",1
This is not original. That's why the price 50% less than regular price..never buy again .only less than  3 hours,0
"Works well, but it came leaking out of the packaging.",1
"This product does NOT claim to regrow hair, but it does state that it boosts hair abundance and anchors the hair bulb to the follicle.  This is a big deal part of the process when dealing with hair loss.  The package came with the bottles and they were not well contained, but heck, its a minor packing problem.  The applicator is a thin white funnel that drops the solution onto your scalp, but I found I had to shake it quite a bit to get it to flow.  A times, I even waited until the bottle was almost empty and then emptied the remaining solution onto my scalp.  I used a brush to style and it dried within 60-90 minutes.  After a bit of drier brushing it did not appear that anything was on my hair or scalp.

I have tried Minoxidil for hair growth and had some success, but that stays wet and sticky for hours.  This solution at one month seems to have thickened or strengthened my hair a little bit.  There is no new hair growth, of course.  I will try another month to see if it is worth continuing, but the price is rather high per month.  It really is a toss-up and I do firmly believe that everyone will have their own specific experience with this product.",0
"I have access to professional hair dryers, and was very excited to see a highly-regarded Babyliss Pro at our local Christmas Tree Shop for under $30.  The power is great, it's not as heavy as other professional dryers, and it works well.

It starts slowly at first:  I will blow dry my hair after my husband (he takes less than 5 minutes, I take over 10 minutes), and the dryer will shut off.  It loses its connection somehow in the high setting.  I will shut it off and it will turn back on, but will ultimately shut off again.  As time goes on, I won't even be able to get it to turn on.  This makes me very sad because other than this switch issue, I LOVE the dryer!

The BAD thing about these dryers, is that the switches don't last.  I'm now on my 4th dryer, the last 3 ALL having the switches go bad in less than a year.  What I *think* is happening is that it gets hot, and somehow the switch loses its connection.

This must be a lower quality dryer made for the average consumer - but I do NOT see it lasting under constant professional use, that's for sure.

I'm going to bite the bullet and buy a more expensive dryer, one that is NOT a Babyliss!  I would hate to have this happen to a $60 dryer!",0
"I wanted to try shave oil with my new German single blade razor, not so easy as I thought, time consuming to use. I went back to disposable blades",0
Love it!,1
Great color to cover dark under eyes.  I wish the container had twice as much peach as tan because I always run out of the peach long before the tan.,1
"This works well for a face cleansing system.  I am not 100% sold on the anti-aging massager.  I will have to use it for much longer, to give a good assessment on that part of it, but for the little time I have been using it, I have not noticed any difference.  I like that there aren't any replacement brush heads, like with other cleanser systems, you are constantly spending more money to buy the replacement brush heads.  And the brush heads aren't usually that cheap.  It works well as a cleanser, so I am satisfied there.",1
"Great razor, it is aggressive to extremely aggressive.",1
Works great on fine hair,1
"this stuff lasts a long time for its value. but i just don't like that lemon scent it leaves behind. otherwise, this is a daily must-have for me. no residue or powdery effect afterward. i love dry shampoo.",1
This styling creme is a nice product when I use hot rollers. Problem is that the nice style does not last all day.  I would like to not have to use two or three styling products to get a look that stays in til the end of the day!,1
After three months of having this blow dryer the low setting no longer works. I only have a high setting which does not work well with fine hair. I would not recommend buying this blow dryer.,0
"Love it, easy to use, holds up big time, good color, been using it for years.",1
"I bought this product to help clean my hair in between washings.  I have dark hair and had an ombre tint on the bottom and was hoping to extend the life of my color.  My hair tends to be naturally thick and oily.  The dry shampoo was extremely difficult to apply myself.  You are supposed to apply it to the roots of your hair, but even using a mirror it was hard to see just how much product was coming out and where.  Ultimately, I was left with a ton of powder on my scalp, but it was hard to work through the rest of my hair.  It made my hair look dusty on top and still dirty and oily on the bottom.  It also has a very strong smell - like lemon mixed with bleach - which was not very refreshing.  As others have noted, it smelled more like cleaning product than cleansing beauty product.  Definitely would not recommend.",0
"I really enjoyed the PCA Blemish Control Bar. I have oily/acne-prone skin that is great 80% of the time and temperamental the other 20%. I found the Blemish Control bar definitely helped soak up all the excess oil.

At first I was surprised that the bar is not really a bar. It's a solid soap in a jar. The cleansing pads make it easy to use and add a small amount of exfoliation.

It does really work to dry out the skin, so I would say using this every day is probably too drying, even for oily skin. I think using this two or three times a week is perfect.

The smell is fresh and inoffensive. I found it to be a good value and a welcome addition to my skincare routine.",1
"The scrubbing component is great , but it leaves an oily thick residue on your face once you wash it is . I have to use a face wash afterwards to remove the layer of oil afterwards .",0
goes with red and pink,1
"I really like the Zoya Julie color. It is hard to find a lavender nail polish, but this is it.
It's also not a matte (flat) color, but it kind of sparkly as well.
Of course the quality is good...it's Zoya after all.",1
Makes my hair feel like I have a build up on it and it bothered my scalp.  The light brown is too dark too.,0
"You may not receive the official product. The consistency is different and it oozes out of the top of the bottle. Leads me to think that what is in the bottle is not actually Onesta. Too late to return, so for me it's a waste of money. Save your time & money.",0
"DO NOT buy this product unless you have a different bottle to put it in. The bottom will break if it is dropped on any hard surface from more than three feet up. The first bottle I bought was about half full when it fell off the bathroom counter as I was getting ready for work and shattered. I purchased a second one, just received it, and placed it on the shelf above my sink and no more than five minutes later I hear a thud and go into my bathroom to find the bottle on the counter, bottom broken, and leave in conditioner everywhere. $20 for something I didn't even get to use because the plastic container acts like glass. Again, it is a nice product but be aware that if you drop it, it will break. I would suggest getting a different spray bottle for it if you do choose to get it.",0
"Sadly the product did not match up o the price and description. I have other Jack Black products, and they are very good. Each of the other products like bar soap or hand lotions are amazing. This isn't it is not any better than $2 a bottle common hair shampoo from Walmart.",0
"This is the first reviews I've written on Amazon, but I just can't say enough about this product. We bought a vacation condo that has hard water, and no matter what shampoo I tried (and I tried them all!) my hair just would not lather up. I ended up using a ton of shampoo just to have limp, still dirty hair. I've been using the Malibu products for a week, and wow! I actually have clean hair again! The shampoo lathers up perfectly, the conditioner is great, and the hard water crystals for weekly use are awesome. I will NOT be without this shampoo ever again! Great purchase!!!",1
I've had this product for a few months and I'm not noticing any changes in my hair follicles. I am a good candidate for this procedure. White skin and dark hair. But this just doesn't seem to be working. Unfortunately I am past the return date or it would be back in the box and in the mail. $300 for no results. :(,0
Thank you. Hopefully everything is in order.,1
"I bought this product expecting the quality to exceed OPI. I was incredibly disappointed. This polish looks nice at first but it chips the first day its on, even with an anti-chip top coat. I finally had to write a negative review today when I opened the bottle I bought about three months ago to find it has congealed into a gummy substance that is impossible to paint on. I'll save my money and buy OPI products that last longer on the nail and in the bottle.",0
I didn't find that it really did anything,0
"I read lots of great reviews, so I expected her to be happy, but it's not for her.  We'll keep trying to get the acne wash she used to get that was branded for Kaiser Permanente in Northern Cali. It was great for her for many years.",0
"This product really works, and it lasts on your scalp until you wash your hair. It is somewhat hard to apply. Since it is fibers, it doesn't spread. You have to keep shaking and shaking the container until you get coverage.",1
This did not work for me at all. I have semi thin blonde hair. I was looking for something to give me some extra volume and waves in the summer. I tried to curl my hair with a wand at first and then spray it but that just made my hair matted and crunchy. Awful really.,0
Great scent but very fleeting. I really don't think its worth it for a 2 second scent blast.,0
I really like this oil helps keep frizz down in the humid climate of flordia! Keeps curls looking good. I just it along w a curl cream and it keeps my hair looking flawless all day long.,1
"These blades are priced above many reputable brands, but aren't particularly sharp, smooth, or durable.  I made the mistake of thinking that since I bought a Merkur razor, I should put high-quality Merkur blades in it.  Wrong.  Save yourself some hassle and get a box of supremely sharp Feathers instead.",0
This has been the best find ever since Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse disappeared from shelves.  I honestly forget that I didn't brush since it works so well.  Can't say much about the whitening aspect but like the clean mouth feel.,1
"I thought maybe my hair had changed somehow as it would not curl at all with this iron. It still baffles me how that could happen. I mean, it got super hot, but absolutely no curl. Very disappointing and total waste of money.",0
I am using this for quiet some time and still loving it. Price point is affordable... Fibers are easy to put on and easy to wash off!,1
"This was NOT true Wen. Real Wen is white and thick. This was clear and watered down. If I could have given less than one star, I would have. Wasted money.",0
It just didn't work as promised.  No difference.,0
I love using this product. You really can not go wrong with Jack Black!,1
Definately not plum. Straight purple. Not happy,0
"I like it..I guess I am trying to find a replacement for my Revo styler which they do not make any more. This is similar but not cordless and it has the blowdry feature. I do not like the blowdry feature for two reasons the first reason is that it's really not strong enough to blow dry anyone's hair that I know, second because the plug-in is exactly the same as a blow dryer and you cannot stick them both in your bathroom socket so I have to use an extension cord. Also I do not recommend it if you have a long thick hair. I never had a problem with my InStyler or my repost Tyler getting my haircut in it or not being able to maintain it.. I recommend this product if you have thin hair not very long",0
Smells wonderful and leaves hair clean with less to no product build up.,1
Didn't make my hair softer or shinier... I found the scent off putting.,0
"This product didn't look like what I expected & for some reason, the product seemed half empty. Wouldn't recommend to anyone!! A waste of money. I should've bought an expensive mascara, instead.",0
"I was under the impression in readung other reviews that thus was an awesome product and the besr means to apply the Toppik powder, to my complete dismay it was the reverse, the applicator was a total mess ; it released either too much powder, or barely nothing, at times , and sometimes pure nothing.
 I inspected the flow area and it was not clogged at all. Also I am not a person that has any handicapp or bad vision, so it is not me , it is the applicator.

I would love to return it, I am past the deadline, as I tend to travel overseas and spend weeks away from home, thus my inability to return.

To further clarify , the hand method after a few times , you get the hang of it and the particles sette. very well on your hair, therefore DO not purchase this item , you will get very frustrated and angry , it really was a nightmare !!!!!!",0
"It's expensive and I never saw a difference in my hair.  In fact, my hair is flat, but it is prob because of the conditioner weighing it down since you're normally supposed to condition ends and not the scalp.  Wouldn't recommend.  After reading the reviews - I am not sure if it is the real thing or a knock-off.",0
"i don't use it daily
i just use every once in a while

i did not get the special comb, and i did not get the spray, and
i dislike how people review those things here instead of reviewing the actual product

this is the only thing that actually conceals while looking natural,
i bought the black one, i have black hair,,,, although if i just sprinkle it on my hair,
there is a difference between the tones of black, and it is apparent,,, thats why i comb my hair
right after (with a normal comb),, it kind of mixes it in and the results are great,
not even my girlfriend or family member can tell im using something

my hair just looks fuller

anyways, thats my review,, but i do believe this product will be different for everybody, depending on the color of your
hair, how bald you are, etc

by the way, just be careful with rain,rain will make it apparent,, and definitely don't get it in your eyes ive heard it is really bad for the eyes

i guess the only reason i did not give it 5 stars was because its not too compatible with water,,, so i have to wait untill
the rogaine drys before i put this on, thats probably why i don't use it so often",1
Smells like roses and its like expected,1
"Product was opened for use and it was dried out. Order this product frequently but this time was
very disappointed,",0
"The texture is great; the color is nice, but not bright enough for  me.",0
I don't know what I would have done without this stuff! If you have well water...try it! I cannot use any other shampoo than Malibu where I live. Well worth the price!,1
"My hair stylist recommended this to me after my previous smoothing product left my hair a bit dry at the ends. I used this for the first time today after my regular shampoo & conditioner (Pureology Moisture) & a small amount of argan oil. My hair has never felt this nice. Before, no matter what high end product I used, my hair still felt so overprocessed & my ends were just not having it.

 I was so amazed by how smooth & soft it was that I've had to tell everyone. I even made my husband touch my hair. Also, it smells AMAZING. I can't wait to try more products from this line like the glossing mist or the texture spray.",1
Love the fragrance,1
This is not a real Paul Mitchell product. Very cheap not an authentic product.,0
"It can be very difficult find a deodorant that doesn't contain aluminum or triclosan; even harder to find one free of these ingredients that actually works.  I am not a fan of the $18-20 price of Malin + Goetz, but it works much better than any of the $5 brands that I have tried.  Keep in mind that without the pore clogging aluminum, this isn't an anti-perspirant.  So, you may sweat slightly.  However, the eucalyptus and citronellyl seem to combat body odor very effectively.

I will continue to use this product unless something more cost effective comes on the market.",1
"terrible all of the products I bought something was wrong with either how they applied, felt, smell, texture, and most of all worsened skin, looks as if all the products made my pores deeper and more black heads around my nose and cheek area and I had minimal issues before using this product, the cleaner, TNS and also the tinted defense cream, it burned and should not. I have used this product previously but bought at my dermatologist.",0
It worked okay,1
"I ordered Grandelash last week of January and after 4 days i received it. :D yippee!

Before applying it, I took a picture of my lashes first. I applied it to my top and bottom lashes.

For the first week, I noticed my eyelashes getting darker and fuller but the length is still the same.

2nd week, my lashes have grown a Little longer, BIG difference when i put the mascara on and I used the Maybelline rocket volume waterproof by the way cause it holds the curl better. My co workers have been noticing my eyelashes especially when they look at me from the side. I told them that im using this product and they checked amazon and bought it right away! :D

By Feb 20, 2013, its going to be the 3rd week, took a picture of my lashes yesterday and compared it! Holycow! I was blown away! My lashes are longer!!it really works! JUST BE PATIENT! Im so happy that my $35 is not a waste!! The instruction states that the full results shows if you continue using it for a month. I never missed a day, so, Im excited!

Im definitely going to repurchase Grandelash! love love love this product!!!",1
This product is a fake,0
These are amazing! I tried this as a sample and I loved the feeling of them. When I bought these I used them when my eyes were puffy and they worked like magic.,1
"Even though the color was darker than I expected, if I blend it out, the color works as a great contour. I have fair Asian skin, so if I applied this all over my face as a bronzer, it would look bizarre. Recommend as a contour, but not as an overall bronzer.

I apply with a contouring brush and blend out with a blending brush. Don't need to apply very much as the bronzer has good pigment, I lightly slide my brush along the bronzer once before applying.",1
It may be that I bought the wrong style brush...but I do have trouble getting the paddle-style brush through my thick but fine hair.  I think these might be overrated.,0
"The material is the best, take care about my hair and i don't have to take a lot of time using it because it smoothes the hair quickly",1
Left my hair worse then straw. Also more hair came out with that shampoo then when I dye it. Not worth the chance.,0
It's worth the extra money.,1
"It works good, however, don't take it with you to travel. Two of these now have ""exploded"" by being placed in my checked luggage on an airplane. The solid powder turns into crumbs. Mess.",0
"I like the smell,and it go's along way.",1
Does not work well at all!,0
Love it. Works great on thick coarse hair.,1
brush is pretty rough on skin!  Careful!,1
"Ordered the product as described and got paul mitchell ""special"" shampoo and conditioner. I returned it immediately.  What you get is not what is pictured",0
I stupidly thought this was a smaller size. That's ok this conditioner is amazing and I love it.,1
"Very moisturizing, not irritating, but very greasy. I cannot use this on my face as it just makes me feel oily for hours. I have dry skin, which is usually never greasy (I often have to moisturize twice!), but this made me feel greasy for hours",0
Great product,1
Good stuff.,1
"This comes off within 2 days and smells like glue,i would not recommend.",0
"Very good product, and smells wonderful.",1
Bought this Jan 2016.  Broke June 2018.  It does have a 5 year warranty so I will try to send it back to the manufacturer but it's disappointing - for $100 I expect it to last more than 18 mos.,0
"I can't recommend these rollers.  1.  They get too hot to touch.  2. Way too heavy.  3. Heated up just fine.
Really liked the idea, just didn't work for me.",0
"did not like it didn't work as in function, unit inoperative.  may like new one",0
"I literally hate this strsightener. And ive had many, so I'm used to the quirks they often have, but this one just sucks. It has sharp edges on the sides of the plates which leave a mark in your hair no matter how you use it. And the back of the plate,  the outside, gets extremely hot. I've burned my fingers a bunch of times. This was not an inexpensive straightener either. Totally unacceptable. Really disappointed.",0
Did not get the $9.99 credit..,0
Product smells like a cheap men's aftershave mixed with perm solution.,0
love the color. needed to reapply often.,1
The best ,1
Makes my skin feel dry and itchy,0
Great best curling iron ever!,1
Exceeded my expectations. I feel more confident knowing my hair looks full and healthy again. Toppik covered all the sparsely spaces on my head. Love it!,1
Horrible.  Fried my hair the first use.  Not worth it.  I'll never use it again,0
"I expected a certain level of quality and uniqueness in a Calvin Klein product, but Eternity Aqua disappointed me on both counts.

It started out nice with a citrusy blast of grapefruit and lime zest, along with a soapy-clean base. It seemed pleasant but not unique: it smelled like any generic 16-21 year old wearing deodorant, body spray, and whose mom washes his clothes in Gain detergent. Not unique at all, but not offensive.

The citrus notes disappeared after about 20 minutes, replaced by an aroma that was extremely familiar but I couldn't quite identify. Then it hit me like a ton of bricks and I knew what it was: the deodorizer ""cakes"" used in men's public restrooms. Urinal cakes.

To add injury to insult, this cologne gave me a raging headache, and despite trying to wash it off three different times with hot soapy water, I couldn't get it off.

24 hours later, I can still smell it. I only used one quick spritz. I've noticed that older reviews of this cologne complain about it wearing off too quickly. My suspicion is that it has been reformulated recently to make it last longer.

I just can't recommend it, unfortunately.  I can, however, recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Versace-Pour-Homme/dp/B001HTTBWQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Versace Pour Homme</a>.  I've been using that cologne for the past year and a half, and I never stop receiving compliments on it.  It smells awesome, doesn't give me a headache, doesn't have any weird ""off"" notes, and amazingly it's less expensive than CK Eternity Aqua.",0
Love this conditioner and smells great. A little pricy though.,1
"This is Not an Oribe product.  Clearly

All of my hair products are Oribe.  Quality, Smell, Cleanser...etc, something is very wrong.",0
"I may have had a defective one, but the edges may not have been smooth because it sounded like it was tearing my hair. Also, it was not effective even at the highest setting for curling my 4c hair.",0
Love this product. Light feel on the skin. The tint is my favorite!!,1
"I'd like it to be a bit darker, but it's a great two in one cosmetic (lips and cheeks).",1
"I was so excited to get this curling iron due to all the awesome reviews! Sadly, it didn't curl my hair. I have long, thick, wavy hair and even tried this on highest setting. I bought the 1 1/4"" and was hoping for a big loose wave, but all i got was a semi wave that lasted 5 seconds. :( boo!",0
I wear NC20 or NW20 in Mac foundation.  I got the light/medium and it works perfectly for me.  I really like this stuff.,1
"It is fake. Contact clarisonic, due to i couldn't register this machine and it is functioning weirdly. It is a fraud. Battling!!!! Even when Amazon stated that XYZ is fulfilled by Amazon,  it doesnt mean anything. Dont waste your time buying this on Amazon...",0
Love it!!my baby had a bad acne and this worked well. Applied it 2x a day and acne went away after a week.,1
"Before trying this spray, I used the Oribe Thickening Spray. I immediately noticed how crunchy-hard that made my fine hair feel, but that if I used a very, very light spray of it, it would add a little volume to my hair.  Still, it was hard to get it just right.  I thought the Volumista spray would be better for fine hair because of the many positive reviews.  Wrong!  It performs just the same as the Thickening Spray!  It almost seems like Volumista is Thickening Spray, just in a different bottle. Crunchy, sticky products on fine hair is disasterous because fine hair is so fragile and breaks so easily with products like this.  To say I am disappointed--at the heft price for each--is an understatement, especially when there is no option to return either product!  I'm giving up on Oribe, even though the fragrance is wonderful!  If only we fine-haired women could find a product that really works and smells as great as the Oribe products!",0
The file is nice but be warned this product cannot be returned if the file breaks in shipment. I order several for Christmas stocking stuffers. One out of four was broken and is not useable. It cannot be returned or refunded. Out $10.,1
"I was a skeptic when considering this purchase solely based on price.  It's definitely not cheap.  I bit the bullet, made the purchase & am glad I did.  I have fine hair and am on the ever ending quest to find that magic potion that gives me big bouncy volume like you see on all those shampoo commercials.  Typically after I style, I hold up sections of my hair, spray generously and then tease immediately after.  I then fluff up the roots with my fingers and comb/smooth over.  It definitely gives me more volume than I've had in the past.  This stuff also smells amazing.  The reason for not giving it 5 stars is because A).  The price and B).  While it does great for me, it's not holy )#*$&R&& this stuff is amazing.  That said until I find something better I'm probably going to continue using this product and would definitely recommend it for thin/fine haired girls like myself.",1
"I have a light to medium beard and I get 2 or 3 decent shaves per blade. Gillette Silver Blue, BIC or Wilkinson sword hold up much better.",0
smells great,1
"After having a spot on my arm diagnosed as basal skin cancer, it was suggested I go through annual skin checks by a dermatologist. Besides obviously limiting my overall sun exposure, my dermatologist recommended that when I do go out in the sun to use a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher and one that is broad spectrum (protects against both UVA and UVB rays). This Nia 24 Sun Damage Prevention 100% Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 meets that criteria.  In addition, it contains Pro-Niacin, which according to their labeling, is clinically shown to visibly improve skin tone, texture and hyperpigmentation.  It has a light scent, is color and dye free, and is made in the United States.  All of this is good.

Now for the negatives.  Their labeling also states, This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, NOT skin cancer or early skin aging.  In addition, this product is not water or sweat resistant.  If not rubbed in all the way, your skin appears white.  I was able to receive this product free of charge from the Amazon Vine program.  When it arrived, I was surprised at just how small the container was, especially considering its price.  I personally cannot justify spending that much money on a sunscreen that may or may not help my skin look any younger than considerably less expensive sunscreens.  I will stick with more affordable brands.",0
not great... harder to use than other curling irons and the result is really not good.,0
I stepped out on a limb to purchase this. I knew it was expensive for lotion but nothing else seemed to work. This works ok after I had to let it thaw out before I could use it. The temperature outside was cold when it shipped and it wouldn't come out if the pump. But all is good now.,1
"I found this to leave my skin feeling greasy as well as having a strong, somewhat cloying fragrance that persisted.  I have used two other moisturizers from Guinot and was very pleased--they absorbed quickly and their fragrances were pleasant without lingering.",0
My wife loves this lip balm.,1
Its not as heavy duty as I had hoped for. Little thinner. As well the metal grommets around the hanger holes are mediocre. Although Great buy for the price!,1
"I see many buyers reporting that they got old, bad product when buying from Amazon. FYI:  There is always a printed number on the bottom of the bottle & if you call into Skin Medica 866-867-0110 & give them that number they can instantly tell when that batch is due to expire or how long ago it was sold. All I have bought on Amazon has checked out to be fresh and new, as promised.
I've only been using this serum (in conjunction with the Dermal Repair Cream) for about 10 days, so we'll see how it goes and if it improves the skin.  But I like how the serum absorbs quickly and a tiny bit goes a LONG way. One pump does the whole face for me.  We'll see what the results are after I use up the whole bottle. FYI: The serum part comes out in a reddish/orange color, so if you see that color it is correct, and the cream side comes out in a creamy white color. You just mix the two together as you're putting it on your face.",1
I bought this off the Mario Badescu website but I want to let you know that this moisturizer works but it feels thick and it's really oily. I will never buy this again.,0
"I like this product for light hold. You can spray it all over your hair and it doesn't feel sticky. I don't know that it gives extra volume like a sea salt spray does, but it also does not make your hair feel dirty.",1
"I ordered these electrical rollers because they looked like they'd be easier on my hair.  They are, but my hair doesn't hold a curl for
more than an hour.",0
I guess they weren't what I thought they were supposed to be for which is a headband.  In a nut shell they were totally useless to me so I gave them a way.,0
Easy to apply. Natural looking color.,1
"This deodorant unfortunately did not work for me which was shocking and really disappointing. I still gave it four stars though because my male partner has been using it for about a year and it works wonderfully on him. Ever since he started using it I have never been the victim of catching horrid whiffs of his armpit during inopportune moments. It has even withstanded the unforgivable hot and humid New York City summer  during rush hour  on the subway platform  with a suit on.

Sadly though, this did not work on me, and Im about half his size and generally work well with common deodorants. I guess there must be some scientific reason for this that I don't know about and while Im really disappointed that it didn't work for me Id still suggest giving it a try.

Also, it has a delightful light smell of clean think  adult baby powder, or just fresh out of the shower. Thankfully Jack Black has made the classy choice of forgoing absurdly (although admittedly funny) man scents like jack hammer, WD 40, and mens locker room. Its not overpowering and works well with any cologne or perfume because its smell is so subtle (in the best way possible).",1
"Product came and was old-- nail polish was goopy, streaky, and unusable.",0
I use this product just before I apply my foundation. My face tends to get very dry after I wash and even after moisturizer. After a few spritz his gives my skin hydration and helps my foundation go on smoothly and cleanly.,1
Gummy.  Very little scrub content in it.  Give it a miss,0
"good for ""evening out"" my tan without feeling heavy or looking like pancake makeup",1
My wife told me they get dangerously too hot to use.  They have been sitting in a drawer for over a year now..........,0
"I am not a huge makeup person and I have a hard time spending a lot of money on make up.  However, I have oily skin and my old foundation was not working.  So I was recommended to try Stila Stay All Day Foundation.  $40 and a couple days later I received the foundation.  It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be for $40 and I was disappointed.  The foundation is hard to put on.  If I am not careful I end up looking streaky.  My skin has a constant shine to it even after applying the foundation.  It has not helped with my oily skin.  I am just disappointed all around and will not spend that much money on foundation ever again.",0
Love it. This sunscreen goes on clear and is not sticky or oily. It doesn't sting my eyes like other brands do were my eyes end up watering all day.,1
"I gave the product 2 stars and would have given it more if the color came out the spray can according to the label. I ordered black, and when I sprayed it on exposed scalp areas it was completely brown and now I have a mismatched head. Thanks Toppik. 0_o",0
Did nothing.,0
the product color was just as the picture show it and the nail color look good on my nail and toes and go good with my skin color as well.,1
Very nice goes on well and thickens and lengthens my lashes!  I like it alot.,1
I like this product.,1
This applicator works ok but I did NOT like the cover-up powder which was very messy.  I prefer a brush on cover -up  that I have been using for 2 years.,0
"I agree with some of the other reviews that this perfume is strong. A little goes a long way.

I don't find it overly floral. The description says it smells like an English garden after the rain. It reminds me of scents Ive seen labeled rain. Its fresh but more of a mature fragrance.

The bottle is chic and hefty. The tortoise shell top is gorgeous. Its got large chunks instead of the typical marble and is predominantly a taupe. Id love jewelry and glasses in the material.",1
Love the color but not worth the money. Plumping lasts maybe an hour at most.,0
"Not worth the money.  Was looking for lip color with SPF.  This is too light, doesn't stay on long at all, and very pricy.  I'll keep looking.",0
"One of the best brush cleaners out there. It leaves my brushes spotless by simply swirling everything around. A little expensive and small, but it does a very nice job. I waited to buy this until it was on sale!",1
"0.5 is too light to remove the outer layer of your skin if you used to use exfoliators and peelings, it's good for beginners or as a daily maintenance use, I will go for Retinol 1.0 now.",1
"I purchased this item because I trust the Paul Mitchell brand. The shampoo and conditioner I received had no reference of Paul Mitchell. I do not trust it and it appears to be a knock off. Pissed off, if I could rate a 0 I could.",0
"I've been applying one coat a day as instructed and my nails look nice and polished. Since I have thin nails that break easily when they're long and I've kept them short for half my life, I can't really say it ""repairs"" damaged nails from experience. I am using this product to PREVENT any damage and to protect and keep my nails healthy. I use this with other Butter London nail products. I use this as the first coat then I use the Nail Foundation Flawless Basecoat and then the polish (I also use Essie and OPI). This and the Nail Foundation Flawless Basecoat will be a regular product I'll be using from Butter London.",1
I really love this kit. I use it every week or two. Great for touch ups too.,1
just my personal feeling It is a bit too sweet,0
"Im an adult, Im not even in my 20s anymore. But Ive been wearing this perfume for years; dudes love it and I love smelling like a stripper.",1
"I wanted to like this product. I had read about it on a site other than Amazon. I was looking for a good product for my oily hair.  This product was so watery that I couldn't get it from my hands to my hair no matter how hard I tried.  I tried to use it several times, but I finally gave up and threw it away.",0
"Based on the rave reviews on Amazon, I was very excited to try this product.  It costs about 4 times the price I normally pay for foundation, but if the coverage worked as well as the reviews were saying, I would happily pay it.  The product was shipped quickly and arrived at my door with no issues.  The packaging is nice; comes with a twist-up/down lid to open and close. But when I applied the foundation, it was NOT at all what I expected.  The other reviews say the coverage is very much full coverage.  I didn't find this to be the case.  I have many acne scars and did not find this foundation to give the coverage promised.  It covered no better than my drugstore foundation.  It feels a little greasy on the skin and doesn't come in a good range of colors either.  I am sorry I spend the money on this product and I will not be buying it again.  I will be sticking with my (much cheaper) Loreal True Match foundation.  For the same price I spent on the Lorac, I can get three bottles of the Loreal.  What a disappointment.",0
I think it is working too early to tell,1
"These blades work great and came with my new Merkur Razor.  I have no complaints, but noticed that the Feather Razor Blades (which are Japanese Stainless) seem to provide me with a little better shave.
I urge you to try a few different kinds to see what works best for your skin type.  I could really use either blade, but like the Feathers slightly better.  With that said, the Feather blades don't seem to hold their razor edge as long (i.e. less shaves per blade).  Not that this is such a big deal - the blade packs are rather affordably priced.",1
"This product is exactly as advertised
Arrived promptly
Thank you",1
"Terrible smell, ended up returning product.",0
Conditioner top broken  and leaked in box,0
"The product isn't bad, but it is the wrong shade! I have been using Temptu for awhile now, and #4 sand is probably the shade I go through the most.  When I got this, I did a side by side comparison and this one is a shade lighter and has a yellow undertone where as the original sand color is supposed to be more beige neutral toned",0
"I followed the instructions to the letter and used a new Mach3 blade.  As I was shaving it was silky smooth and smelled good.

The trouble was, the shave didn't work!  I think this thick oil sticks the whiskers flat against the skin and the razor just glides over the top of them without cutting them off.  I did have a 5 day growth, so perhaps it works better when the whiskers are short.  But I wound up shaving three times to get a smooth finish.

Ordinary skin lotion 5 minutes before a shave works better and is much cheaper.",0
"The dryer itself isn't bad, BUT the frustration when the concentrater nozzle continues to fall off multiple times throughout one drying session is crazy! Its good to know I'm not the only one with this problem based off other Amazon reviews.",0
"This particular flavor includes menthol, which gives it a cool tingle that is nice. Proraso is one of the easiest soaps to shave with. Instant easy lather, works fine with a little water or a lot, and super slick for easy irritation-free shaving with the sharpest of blades. I just wish the smell wasn't so strong and pungent. This stuff has a powerful fragrance that could knock over a horse from fifty paces. Luckily, the fragrance fades away quickly when you rinse your face after shaving. It is a perfectly fine fragrance, definitely masculine, it's just way too concentrated for my taste. This strong scent is typical for other european soaps like Tabac or Arco. If you want something with a more subtle scent, but still easy to lather, I'd recommend Haslinger over this -- and, Haslinger is what I'm going to go back to after trying this Proraso soap. However, I'll keep this Proraso soap around, in partucular, because it has menthol in it, and it's the only soap I have containing menthol.",1
"This styling spray did not add volume to my hair.  Prior to purchase, I watched a ""how to"" type video of a product rep demonstrating how to apply and use this product.  Maybe it's just my hair, but I did not get results remotely similar to the video.",0
"Lightweight, but super moisturizing. Makeup glides over it and makes your skin look radiant. I get compliments on my skin DAILY!",1
"Great size for applying self tanning products all over the body. It can be reused, just wash with soap and water.",1
"This product works really well. It's a little weird, put it in your hair and instantly have what appears to be thicker hair and it does what you want it to. Only draw back, I have to use a harsher shampoo at least once a week if I use it every day. It gets a build up. But I like it a lot.",1
"Couldn't stomach the smell of the product, so I never use it!! Smells like a man's cologne which I DON'T want my hair to smell like!!!  Gave the bottle to my husband and HE DIDN'T LIKE THE SMELL EITHER!!!  WON'T be purchasing this again!!!",0
definitely not tangle free.  the brush part is hard and hair will not come out of it. nearly had to cut hair out.,0
"I am a firm believer that you get what you pay for. Yes, the price for bliss On the Line Liquid Liner is more than you would pay at the drugstore, but the quality is much better. With Bliss, it is quick and easy to flawlessly apply eye liner. It does not smudge and it dries quickly, which makes it an easy switch for those like me, who normally use pencil liner. What I love most is that even with my watery eyes (due to contact wear and allergies), it stays put all day long, yet is easy to remove at the end of the evening. So glad I discovered this product.",1
It's purple instead of light brown. Otherwise good.,0
Great,1
"I've had this bottle since Christmas, so it's been less than a month. For the first couple weeks I was in love, and was amazed at how much water I was drinking. It's fun to fill up because it's nice to hold, look at, and use. I'm a designer, and it just makes sense I would gravitate to this beautiful object. Within the 2 weeks after buying my BKR I was spending a lot of time on the BKR site, thinking about the next one I wanted to buy in the 1L size, and which one I wanted to buy for my boyfriend. Unfortunately, since then, this bottle has let me down to the extent that I can't trust my next purchase from BKR would be worthwhile.

The loop on the bottle cap is designed in such a way that it's comfortable to hold while you're on the go. However, the seal just isn't tight, and this is within less than a month of using this new bottle. If you're holding the loop by your fingers and walking around, the bottle can untighten itself from the cap because of the movement. I've dropped the bottle just walking around shopping because the cap became unscrewed simply because of carrying it. Fortunately it didn't break, but I did end up spilling water all over a shop floor. It's not reasonable that a water bottle's cap needs to be retightened constantly to safeguard against something unsavory happening.

The bottle cap can also easily come loose in your bag and drench your valuables, as it did my camera and laptop yesterday as I sat down for a 5-minute tea tasting. Fortunately I realized my backpack was dripping on my way out, and the proprietor was able to give me some towels to sop up the mess - but this was too close for comfort.

The design of this bottle, while beautiful, is not functionally sound. I would rather use this bottle stopped with a wine cork than the lid it's come with. We all need a bottle we can rely on, what with our active lifestyles and expensive devices, and I hope BKR puts further design thought into this product.",0
Love this cologne.  I bought it as a gift for my husband.  The price was absolutely great and the bottle is huge.,1
"All you need is 2 pea sized balls of cream for your whole face and it does leave a soothing cool feeling.
The downside is it leaves a strong barbershop scent on you.  The smell is really strong and hard to take off.",0
I awoke 2 consecutive mornings after using this product looking like a wrinkled prune!!  I'm trying to return the EltaMD PM Therapy cream with difficulty.,0
PRetty good quality.,1
Bought this because it was #1 of top 10 colognes that drive women wild.  Not sure if it does that but pretty strong stuff and more expensive than I am used to which is why I only gave it a 4 instead of 5.  Quality of packing is one of the best I've ever seen..  Need more time.,1
I've only ever had one size of toppik tin... and this doesn't fit it. I'm assuming it fits a larger size that I don't own? Waste of $$.,0
This is more of a pink then nude...,0
"This is my favorite clarifying shampoo. I have fine, color treated hair. Whenever I feel that my hair is not acting right...I use this and were good.",1
Very awkward to use. . . easy to burn self.,0
"This moisturizer is about double the price that it should be, and off the top of my head I can name at least 10 high end mens moisturizers that are far superior.  Stick with Jack Black, Kiehls,  and lab series products instead.",0
"The product inside looks fine, but it was shipped in a bubbly envelope. It arrived completely banged and the carton cannot be used for the gift I pretended it to be, it ruined my Christmas gift. Please ship in a box as many others do.",0
A+,1
"I'm rating it a 4 because the polish does not stick to my nails for long. Within days the polish begins to chip off my nails. If this polish is salon quality, I must be doing something wrong maybe? I use the base coat, color coat and finish off with 2 top coats. My nails ALWAYS come out beautiful and I get compliments all the time. I'm just not too happy with the many times I have to go back and fix my nails.",1
I get allergic reaction and my face is all messed up ,0
It doesn't smell at all like Lacoste. I bought it for my mom and it is waste of money. Don't buy it it is nor real.,0
"Excellent product. There is absolutely no white cast, with a very high ZnO percentage. My only complaint is that it is slightly tacky to the touch after it has been put on your face.",1
Never thought a hair dryer was causing my frizz.  This one dryes your hair quickly and no more frizz.  Awesome,1
"This face wash does an amazing job. It cleans well, without over drying, and a little goes a long way. The only issue I have is the smell. It's not terrible, you just cant put your finger on what it does smell like. Aromatherapy? Spa oil's? Bathroom cleaner? Whatever the smell is, its not bad enough for me to not keep purchasing this wash. It's the best wash ever.",1
LORAC what a disappointment with your black eyeliner. It just doesnt work. Never buy any of your products again.,0
"Proraso must have changed the formula, as it does not have the good sandlewood scent it had before.  Other than that it works ok.  Its nice to have its own sealable non rusting container.",0
Seemed like it was diluted as compared to salon bought.,0
Really good diffuser--one of the best I've ever had--but the price is ridiculous.,1
Blades are very thin and very sharp.,1
"I ordered something similar for years from plastic surgeon, he no longer sells it. This is the same thing and cost less. Very good product.",1
Doesn't even help my hair look less greasy and smells weird and makes my hair crazy stiff and knotted. It's like spraying extra strength hair spray in your hair.,0
"So far so good! I really like the dispenser - fun! And I have noticed my hair is easier to manage. Not a fan of the smell, but at least its not overpowering as to make it useless. Haven't tried it as a primer yet.",1
"I`ve used Hydra 5 serum for years and LOVE it...it REALLY does the job...soooooooooooooooo, I thought...this can only be better, since it says PROFESSIONAL on the bottle.  Save your money ladies, and gents...it doesn`t hold a candle to the Hydra 5 serum...I`m switching back.",0
"Did not care the smell of this product.  It also made my hair a bit drier than I like but it may be the same Obliphica shampoo that I used with this product. After using the conditioner, my hair just did not have that protective glide when I combed my wet hair through.",0
Not a smooth application. Perhaps lacks a quality color base. Would not recommend and would not buy again until the formula is improved.,0
"Love the smell, haven't used it so I don't really know if it's great on my skin yet (I have dry skin) but it arrived pretty fast. I'll update when I see any results!",1
"I do not hate anything, but not satisfied.
I had ordered the product above, but instead another one was shipped to me. So I need to return it asap.
Thank you.",0
awesome !,1
"I got a good shave with it but not sure if the slant really provided anything of value.  I was expecting a more comfortable shave given the slicing motion in the design but it's closeness and comfort was no better than any other DE razor.  Still, Merkur makes a quality razor and it's well made and balanced.",1
No fragrance!!!~Maybe it was stored too long and the fragrance evaporated?,0
Terrible does not cover or stay put!!!!!!!,0
"Nothing great, didn't really meet my expectations for the price point. Plenty of other mens shampoo you could buy. I'll buy anthony's logistics for men before i buy this stuff.",0
"These lotions are great, I really love them. I wish I could buy just sample lotions and not the wash of face scrub, however, they are nice as well!",1
"Beautiful when it worked, but broke down after a few uses, and my month to return the product just passed. Disappointed",0
"NOT the blind you r used to. Clumpy as all get out, hardly get any full strands to wash off (ie, no worms *any regular Blinc users know what I mean) it flakes and fades.. even if I wanted to like it, it was empty in less than 6 weeks.",0
I have super fine hair.  I had my hair cut by an extremely high end salon.  The stylist suggested I start using Rusk Thick.  I did and liked it.  Made my hair more voluminous.  When I ran out and went to reorder I saw Rusk ThickR.  This product is 10 times better and I actually liked the original.  Highly recommend!  I pray everyday that RUsk doesn't stop making it.,1
"I absolutely LOVE this mascara! I don't have any of the problems other reviewers have mentioned about flaking. Mine never flakes. And it's so easy to remove! With regular mascara, I always ended up with black marks under my eyes that no makeup remover could completely get rid of. With this mascara, I don't have to worry about that anymore. No runs, no raccoon eyes, no flaking. I love it!",1
"This is the new packaging for the Biolage Hydrating shampoo that I have used for years.  The ingredients read the same on the bottle, but it completely dries out my hair every time I try to use it.  I will look for a completely different brand of shampoo.",0
Excellent face cream,1
Unfortunately it took 4 coats for the color to show,0
Best facial sunscreen I've found  Very reasonable price,1
"I bought this last November, so I've had the one inch flat iron for about 10 months. I loved it and it worked great. Yesterday, I decided to use it after not straightening my hair all summer and as I was using it, I kept seeing little shiny flakes in my hair. I looked at the iron and the black finish was flaking off into my hair. After it cooled down, I rubbed it with a nail and more just kept flaking off and underneath was soft metal- not ceramic- I could scratch it with my nail. I don't know what caused it to do that but I'm now searching for a new flat iron. I suspect most are not ceramic as advertised, they're just getting better at making the flat irons look as though they were.",0
I buy this from my hairdressers this product wasn't even the same color and left my hair dry.,0
This color is a bit like barbie pink?? also it is super opaque..i needed like 4 coats,0
Really makes a difference in dry cuticles if used consistently.  Easier to use that hand cream.  I have tried everything and this is the product that works best for me.,1
This was the first time I tried the recovery cream.  It's rich and absorbs well into the skin.  I also bought the redness reducer and would recommend that too.,1
It does work!,1
"Way overpriced, very disappointing. Will not buy again.",0
"the picture has the purple authenticity of hot tools and mine didnt. And every thing about is different.

This was my original review:

 My mom had purchase this curling iron back in 2005 and to now it has worked amazing. It has dropped many times, I mean do the math from 2005 to 2013 & we probably use 2-3 times a week and we got a new puppy who unfortunate ripped the cord so here I had to order a new one and this looks nothing like the original it doesnt glide easily like the other one & I know it should because I have a few other and ALL of them slide easily when curling it. So im not to convince this is the real one I will do my research and see if this is a knockoff I hope not or else ill be returning it I will come back and update you guys if it is",0
"Two stars because of the color and need for reapplication. I also have to set with powder for staying power. Can't say I'd recommend the product because I've found that drug store brand nude eye pencils to be as, if not more, effective in coverage. I have only a small area above my lip, this product hasn't worked for me.",0
"This came in a regular squeeze tube.  The last one I got had a pump, which always dispensed the right amount. I knocked off one star for that because I liked the pump and thought that was what I was getting.",1
great smell,1
Didn't even feel drying at all. Didn't make any difference to my pimples at all.,0
"I've been using the other version found on Amazon for years and had no idea it was the knock-off.
This shampoo is AMAZING. I'm so glad I learned about this. It smells wonderful and leaves my hair soft and silky with no build-up at all. I wish I'd found this version sooner. Fantastic stuff.",1
"I thought the color would be more coral, but it's pretty bright pink. The polish chips faster than I expected for the price, but it applies really smoothly.",1
"I bought this product to use along with another 10% peroxide. I don't care for it at all. It's very grainy, sticky and hard to smooth. It leaves a residue and it's just hard to use. I do not recommend this product nor can I say if it has any effectiveness because it's so hard to use.",0
"Just remembered why I stopped wearing this before.  Love the look and the smell is great but it does nothing for even the slightest body odor.  Maybe if you wear a non-scented deodorant that works and put this on top for its light fragrance, but who wears two deodorants?  Going back to my two dollar Tom's.",0
"It is bad,It blurs my camera, not even clearer. i tested it on many devices and none of them work",0
have been using this for a couple of years regularly.  remember that i started taking it because my hair was thinning.  My hair has been normal.  Growth is good and hair fall out is typical.  I continue to take this nutrient since I don't want to loose effect of supplement.,1
I don't care for this product compared to their FOAMING facial cleanser. I feel as though the foaming facial cleanser cleans much better. This particular product KILLS if it gets in your eyes! Not good for using if you want to use it on your face and to take your mascara off. I HIGHLY recommend the foaming cleanser over this.,0
The pump leaks making for waste and mess.  Such a shame cause product seemed good.  For the price should have better pump,0
Color is not as expected. Looks like a faded brown. It just looks to faded/ muted.,0
Ive used crucial moisture for over 10 years. But I wanted something a little bit better for dry cold winters. This seems to do the job. Nice light scent. Smooth but thicker than crucial moisture. After putting on my face there's a sheen for a little bit until it absorbs fully. I would not use this outside of winter or it would irritate my skin.  My only reason for 4 stars is the price. A little bit too much but I'd buy again,1
I love this hair striaghtener . All I needed was a good hair apart and my hair looks fabulous !,1
Did not like the fragance. I was expecting zero fragance con it.,0
"I just got this, this is my second day using it, and now I have a hot red painful rash all over my neck from this cream. :-( Would not recommend. Or at least patch test a tiny area for a few days before putting it all over your neck.",0
"I really wanted this to work well.  I gave it a fair shot, testing it on one hand and China Glaze Strong Adhesion Base Coat (my normal base) on the other.  NO contest; the Stickey rarely lasts more than a couple days without chips; CG normally gets me at least 5.  I've used it with both OPI and China Glaze polishes and see little or no difference.  I even tried this on my daughter--no change.

Bottom line:  Base coats are really subjective.  Try a few, but don't expect miracles just because someone else likes it.  And stock. up. if you find one you like!",0
"This was my second Clairsonic. Obviously I liked the product or I would not have purchased a 2nd one. I have had this for just less than a year and it will not keep a charge. One use & the battery is dead then it needs charging again. It has 2 speeds but they both seem the same- there is no difference.

I think the product is a rip off. You can a find better facial brush at Walgreens for 10% of the cost of this product.",0
It's really moisturizing. I ware it overnight and my lips feel smooth the next morning. I don't like the ginger smell although I know a lot people love it.,1
"It's OK. Not as rich as some of the silver shampoos I've tried. It makes the silvers sparkle, but my hair seems a little dry with it. I suppose maybe it's just my hair texture.",1
Seemed like a good value but was weak...Almost seemed like it was going to quit even after it was charged for 24 hours. Ok for some things - Not for others,0
"If you're already familiar with this product, it's a great size & bottle top type for travel- unlike most other travel bottles, this one doesn't just pop up from pressure changes on a plane, it has to be pressed on one side of the top for the opening to let shampoo out. That alone is worth having, but it's a good shampoo & the max TSA size of 3.4 oz lasts a long time.",1
Love these! I don't have much to compare them to but these have improved my skin texture significantly without drying me out. Will repurchase again and again.,1
"I observed a plumping of the lips when I first applied the product; however, it diminished with time. Having said that, I'll probably still purchase it again since I prefer a more subtle look....................",1
bueno,1
"After a short time of using, the holes seem to be half blocked, which makes spraying not as even as before.",0
"Not a good moisturizer, especially for the price. I was constantly using more and more, but hands still always felt dry.  Scent wasn't great either.",0
This product is TINY- like a sample size. Realize what 1 ounce looks like and expect something way smaller than a travel size toothpaste-not worth the price.,0
"Bottle was a lot smaller than I expected.....so my suggestion is to just buy the large $20/25 dollar bottle and just fill up a travel size and save some money. Otherwise, this shampoo is amazing and leaves my hair feeling like a million bucks.",1
"Lovely cream, my mum has been using it for about half her life and now I am using it as my mum looks great for her age. Product arrived quickly too.",1
"I have rosacea, my face is flaking from this. It burns and feels tight",0
"I love this cream.
I use it to moisturize my skin every day.
There is no smell and no greasy film.
I recommend it.",1
A bit of a choco-peppermint smell.  Does a decent job.,1
Loved it.,1
Doesn't really work. No special qualities that I can see.,0
"I bought this based off of the reviews I read, but I'm disappointed with my experience with this product. I've only used it once. It doesn't get that hot and it doesn't make or hold the curls.",0
"This product works as advertised. I have yet to burn my fingers with it. It's made well and even comes with two extra springs. It doesn't take all morning to heat and there are enough settings to find the one you want.

Highly recommend!",1
Did not work on my baby's cradle cap at all. Too expensive to not work.,0
"Love the coverage of this product, it's both creamy and powdery at the same time. Not sure why, but after about a month the product seems to get compacted down in the, well, compact it comes in, and then it must be chipped away at. I've gotten used to it but would rather the product stay consistent and easy until it's all gone.",1
I didn't care for this product. This particular color was not complimentary to my skin  tone. It was chalky on my lips and eventually  made them very dry. I think I'll pass on this one.,0
I have not noticed any noticeable difference whether I use it or not.  It is very expensive.,0
"It does thicken my hair just a little. It has a great fragrance. My hair feels very soft, and it looks shiny.",1
This is a wonderful eye cream that helps with tired eyes and fine lines. I use the Image Skincare products for all my facial needs. This eye cream works well with the face cream and serum.  There is no burning sensation or sticky feel after applying.  It soaks into the delicate skin around the eyes quickly.  I also use this for the lines around my lips.,1
didn't like the smell and made my head itchy,0
I love the smell! Lasts all day. One of my favorites. The bottle leaked during shipping though and was almost gone when I got it.,1
This color & product is absolutely AWFUL!!!  The color is so bright & so dark that it makes you look like a clown!!,0
"This product is awful, it dried my skin and irritated it so much that I had to go see a doctor.  When the doctor looked at the ingredients, he told me there are so many harsh ingredients in this product that he is not surprised to see the reaction on  my skin.
I tried contacting their customer service who redirected me to a customer service email address,, I then wrote to that email address and never heard from them.. probably because they don't have an answer to justify why they use harsh ingredients in their prodcucts (some of which can cause cancer)
I don't care how much I paid for this product, but it's going in the garbage, my health is more important!  Shame on you Mario Badescu Inc. for using harsh ingredients in your products.",0
Good,1
"I had a T3 hair dryer for about 10 years and loved it, then my German Shepherd puppy got tangled up with the cord and it landed on the floor and broke. I bought this BaByliss hair dryer to replace it. I have fine curly hair and even with a leave in conditioner this dryer left my hair a tangled snarly mess. It has a lot of power to dry your hair fast but it just didn't work for me or my curls. I decided to return and buy the T3 featherweight 2i. The T3 dries my hair fast on the low speed setting and even without a diffuser my curls looked fantastic!",0
"Oh boy, my aging skin loves this!  Very light but buildable coverage.  F30 is perfect and I am very fair with pink undertones.  Doesn't creep into fine lines or turn greasy on my normal skin.  I get many compliments.  Try a sample first from Ulta and then order online.  Be cautious, I recently ordered thru Amazon and got a very old product that had oxidized (it was in different packaging, my first clue). Returned for a prompt refund.  The package u see here is the most current.  Love the environmentally conscious pouch that also let's you utilize every drop. I wear it every day, usually with a Loreal or MakeupForever powder and it lasts at least six months.  Has never made my middle aged peri meno skin break out, unlike other products loaded with silicone derivatives.  Love it and hope it is never discontinued.  Switched from a Clinique product I'd been using for 20 years and couldn't be happier. If you don't need heavy coverage give it a try.  Bet you'll love it, too.

Update on 11/28/2014:  Found that now the Kohl's stores with the higher end makeup carry Cargo.  Unfortunately, Cargo changed the formula and in doing so the colors have totally changed.  What was F30 and perfect for my complexion is now at least 3 levels darker and has a VERY orange undertone.  The two lighter shades are also much more yellow/orange.  I've called and emailed Cargo customer service but never got a reply.  I understand from reading comments on various sites that they removed the parabens (a preservative) and in doing so all of the colors have changed.  Back to Clinique.",0
"I rarely pinch my eyelashes using the standard drugstore curlers, but it happens.  Also, in cold weather the metal definitely gives the wrong wakeup. This is indeed a pocket curler and it works great.  The curl lasts longer and is very easy to use.",1
"This product really dried out my skin after a couple of uses. It may work on really oily skin but for combination/sensitive skin like mine, it didn't help me.",0
"I would post 5 stars for the product, I love it!  I buy it frequently on Amazon, but one of the times the refill was useless because it was cracked in the mail.",1
"It seems to me that there's a percentage of people for whom these skin rejuvenating products sometimes don't work. Unfortunately, with this product, I'm in that group. My skin was moisturized, and fine lines were slightly diminished, but that was it; there was no other benefit. In addition, it has added fragrance, so even if it did work, I wouldn't purchase it. Just too smelly for me, and the smell got on my pillowcase. Even if this did work and wasn't scented, I still wouldn't purchase it. At $50 an ounce, it's just too costly. On the upside, I had no reaction to this lotion. No redness, peeling, flaking, or rash.",0
"This shampoo is ok.  It smells nice, and has a unique thick consistency.  My hair was shiny after I used it--though not hugely different than when I use any other shampoo.  The shampoo does NOT deliver results that render it worth the ridiculously high price, though!  The label claims it to be ""the fountain of youth for hair"" and to ""protect your hair and hair color"", and touts all the amazing ingredients in it.  Yet, when I looked up the ingredients, the 2nd and 3rd ingredients (after water) are Sodium Laureth Sulfate, and Fragrance...the same JUNK you would get in any 99 cent bottle of drugstore brand shampoo!  Sodium Laureth Sulfate is an inexpensive lathering product--basically a detergent--and one that is commonly known to fade color treated hair, not protect it! (Many hair stylists recommend sulfate-free shampoos for color treated hair). You have to go way down the ingredient list, past a long list of chemicals, to get to the ""pure plant extracts"" that the label touts.  You can easily find a better shampoo, for 1/10 the price. I won't waste my money on this again.",0
"SkinMedica Sensitive Skin Cleanser

Don't waste your money. Don't get me wrong, I love SkinMedica products, but this one is worthless. It doesn't even seem to clean your face! Now that surely defeats the purpose. If I could, I would return it. I used it once and that was once will never again. Their regular cleanser is fantastic. Foolish me. I wasted money. Live and learn.",0
On sale by one sent..... Really?,0
I like the product and seems to help with under eye puffiness.,1
Bought as a gift and it's not the original. Sorely disappointed as my girlfriend really love this scent.,0
ACNEFREE and BYEBYE BLEMISH make this same product in the same glass jar for about $6.,0
"I was amazed that it worked my daughter has severs hair loss you can see her scalp, , she is in her early 20's and that was real bad feeling for her so when I got her this product and I used it on her it was like a miracle.",1
It made my under eye area look puffy. I didn't have bags before using this. Discontinued use and my eyes look normal. If you have sunken eyes then this might be the product for you.,0
"looking for a replacement for discontinued Serious Skin A Copper Cream.  This product fits the bill.
Somewhat expensive for the amount of product, but it does contribute to an overall health appearance of the skin.",1
Smells Great! Shipped well!,1
It works all the time.,1
when I received it it was broken and i really needed it so I had to purchase it somewhere else much more expensive.,0
"There is clearly more marketing than product going on with this Baxter of California Night Cream.  It is marketed as a night cream For Men, and everything about it is designed to appeal to the masculine ego, and convince the dudes that putting on a night cream before sleep won't un-man you. The marketing claims that mens skin is different from womens, and this product is specifically formulated for me.

Im not sure that I buy that. Both my wife and I tried this night cream out, and I cant say that there was any perceivable difference. It works wellthe AHA formula cleans off the dried skin overnight, and is especially welcome during cold and windy winters.  It is a thick cream, almost like a mask, which is odd if you haven't tried it before. It comes out almost like toothpaste, which was a shock at first. But it blends into the skin nicely. All in all, we are pleased with the results.

The biggest bonus for this night creamand maybe why it is targeted for menis that it is entirely odor free. I like that. I don't want any scents in my product, especially for a night cream. If you are interested in natural products, then Baxter of California is not for you. The ingredients lists is full of unpronounceables. Dimethicone and parabens and propolyne glycol and that sort of thing.",1
Not happy with this item. It does not get hot enough.,0
"After a lot of considering I decided to buy the berry one. At first I was disappointed with the color in the tube, it looks very pinkish and light, not at all like the color shown on this site. But I decided to give it a try, and it appears darker and redder on lips, which is good. It's still not quite as intense as shown on the website though. But I like the color so far, it's more of a blu-ish bright berry color under natural light, and it has more orange under warm yellow indoor light. I like this variation of the color.

It's not a very ""wet"" lipstick, doesn't look like it's easy to melt, which is good. It also does not bleed. The color stays on well. I prefer a more matte effect, so I always blot my lips a bit after applying. Without blotting the color has a pigmented shine on it.",1
"Love this hair dryer so far. I have thick hair and it takes forever to dry all the way. This dryer has cut the drying time down by more than half what it usually took with other hair dryers. I was skeptical, but I have to admit that it has helped cut down on the static in my hair. It also comes with four attachements so you do not have to buy a difusser, etc. I have had other BaBylliss products and they have lasted for many years, where other brands have quit. It is expensive, but I feel it is well worth the money.",1
"The bottle I received is a cheap knock off, NOT a real OPI bottle. I have a bottle of the real (store bought) Youre Such a Budapest and this is not the same product at all. See: my pictures, bottle on the left is real and bottle on the right is what this seller sent me. The labels on the bottle are completely different and the polish itself is watery garbage and definitely not worth spending $10. The color isn't even a dupe to the real version; the real YSAB is a subdued periwinkle color whereas the fake is a more childish and bright lavender. I wouldnt buy this crap from the drugstore for $2.",0
I have been using the Nioxin line of products for years.  I started using it when my very fine hair began thinning during the summer months. I noticed a dramatic change following the use of the Nioxin products.  My fine treated hair feels and looks very thick and I no longer lose the large quantities of hair that I once did.  This product really works.,1
it does its job. By itself without a blow dryer  the hair does get straight but it's not as good if you blowdried the hair first. It's from wet to dry but I still would rather not do it like that.,1
The hair spray was packedi well but when I opened it and took the cap off the nozzle was loose and it looked like part of it had broken off and when I tried to spray my hair it fell off and I was unable to get it back on and all the hair spray fizzled out of the can so I ended up paying for nothing.  Didn't request a credit because by the time I returned the empty hair spray canister it wouldn't have been worth the shipping charges.  Perhaps hair spray isn't an easy product to put in the mail for some reason????,0
"My wife loves this stuff, we buy it every few months and she loves the way her hair feels and smells after using it.",1
Not the same as what it claims to replace,0
Love the product. But... the sprayer clogs so easily and constantly. It really is poor design for the product. Needs to be a pump spray bottle I think.,0
"Love this. Just wish it had smelled like chocolate like the other one I bought. Great smell, just not the chocolate.",1
"Got this blow dryer because it was supposed to be #1 lightweight. #2 quiet. Nope.
It was, however, very, very pretty.
I justified the high price in my brain because it had nice straightener. Nope.
I did not even test the straightener because it was just.so little. Very narrow. Cute, really. I have longish hair, past my shoulders, and this would take forever.
{I have bad wrists and shoulders so the description of 'lightweight' was important to me}",0
"Ordered this bag for my granddaughter who is an aspiring makeup artist.  It started to fall apart from the first time she put her very expensive brushes and products into it.  If she had not needed to use it the very next day, after receiving it, I would not have repaired it and and would have sent it back for a refund.  The design is great, but that does not make up for the stitching that is very poor and weak.",0
My husband has cystic acne and said its the BEST hes ever used even over prescription meds. He uses it 2X a day and his skin looks amazing!,1
"same, i have barely used it and it only blows cold air now. useless.",0
Will buy again,1
"I was expecting this to stay on all day, but not the case.  I was told this would be a good option so I decided to try it and it was really no different than the other ones I've tired, except this one was much pricier. It smeared and didn't stay on as advertised; a disappointment.
I would never purchase it again.  If I could return it, I would.
Ill keep searching for that eyeliner that really stays on.",0
"Love it! Make sure to moisturize lips prior to application to prevent chapped lips. Otherwise, this is a great product!",1
"My fine, wavyish, color treated hair is a disaster of static electricity in the winter, and putting a small amount of this product in my hair after showering and allowing it to dry naturally really helps. I have noticed that hair can seem lank or greasy with too much, but that's pretty much true of any product, so I don't hold it against Ouidad.",1
"I hate sticky lipgloss and I had high hopes of this one, so while the color is lovely, it is just as sticky and gloopy as every other lipgloss.",0
"This works! I have been applying it twice a day now for almost a month and my lashes have gotten fuller and longer. After a week I noticed the fullness and then in about three weeks I noticed the length. I don't even have to apply mascara!! I hope the length of my lashes get even longer but other than that, this product works!! I will be ordering more!",1
"The polish I received looks nothing like the one shown for sale. It looks more similar to Essie's ""Play Date."" This was also the first time I've purchased nail polish online. Lesson learned: stick to purchasing polish in person.",0
The pump came broken and I could not use it so I had to find another container and it was disappointing,0
"My wife is the primary user and she is very pleased with it. Skin seems to be smoother and without a doubt it shrinks the pore size. The only negative would be with the dispenser, you have to be very careful not to squirt out too much.",1
"This is not a water proof eyeliner. If you are wanting something that you can go to the beach or the pool with this ain't it. That said, I am one of those hypersensitive people when it comes to make up. Certain eyeliners really irritate my eyes and make incredibly itchy and burning sensations when they come in contact with my eyes. I did NOT have that issue with this eyeliner. It went on smooth and was easy to apply. I gave it 4 stars because I had an incredibly difficult time getting the plastic seal off and it really wasn't a choice eyeliner for a rainy day but it did the job and wasn't irritating at all to my eyelids or my eyes.",1
"Not true Hawaiian orchid! Hate the color won't use, unfortunately I threw away the package so I can't return!",0
I didn't notice a change at all and I was working out everyday and eating on a strict diet. Disappointed in product,0
Excellent cream for sensitive skin and much cheaper than dermatologist.,1
no comments,1
Good product,1
"I have just finished my third treatment on both legs, arm pits, chin, and lip.  I was skeptical when I began and six weeks later there AREA changes!  My leg hair that had to be shaved every other day takes over a week to need shaving and is very soft light hair.  This was the first place to see results and it is dramatic.  My arm pits are softer but still growing yet half the speed as before lazer use.  My face hair is responding a little slower but it IS responding.  I there is less hair and it grows a little slower.  It seems to be softer so the hair itself is changing texture and growth rate.

after I received this from my AMAZON wish list I jumped right in and mistakenly I used this over a tattoo on my ankle where I can barely see and omg POP it hurt for a few days after.  It literally burnt the skin.  I can't imagine a very darkly completed person would enjoy this process.  Even if you zap a wrinkle in the skin like behind a knee POP it stings!  Thankfully I have very fair skin and the process is mostly comfortable unless I zap a wrinkle or my tattoo which I will NEVER forget to avoid again.

I have a NONO and this is close to the same price but actually does the job!  I'm seriously impressed by this machine!  I had to change my bulb half way through this third treatment but I luckily purchased one in advance so I had it covered.  I would suggest the same if you buy it because those flashes go fast having a treatment window only 1 inch wide and 1/2 inch tall.  It's a lot of zapping to do an entire area.  I did my chin twice each session BTW.

I'm very excited that I have finally found something that deals with this at home and affordably.  Good luck to you and I will update in another month or so on my progress. :o)",1
Too hard to rub in and get it even. Dries really fast which makes it hard to use. Color is decent.,0
"I like wearing neutral color on my nails and I usually love Essie.  I went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  I was disappointed with the product.  It goes on with lots of streaks.  It needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  I stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  I doubt that I would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but I will experiment.  It is a good color for the office, but I still wish that it was less ""watery"".",0
"I like all O.P.I. products thus far with the exception of the Matte finish. Nail Envy is wonderful, just be sure it is the original finish and not the matte finish.",1
A little goes a long way.  Left my hair looking really oily afterwards,0
My doctor loves this cover. I love it too. Not greasy but it covers well.,1
The product is easy to apply. I was hoping it would create more volume and with my hair it didnt. Maybe I have to much hair but it left it flat.,0
I have tried this in the past and got no better results than with other polishes that say they make your nails stronger but actually don't work. I prefer nutranail 5-7 day growth aloe formula plus Healthy Hoof..,0
Might just be me but not a fan. I was expecting it to help control curl friz and it didn't. Seller did great on the transaction.,1
"So I smelled this at Dillards and read the reviews online and thought I could save some dollars. It IS the same smell but even after comparing the fresh parfum description to the Dillards one, it matched but I can tell you it is NOT as strong as mall version nor does it stay on as long. It's a very faint and clean smell. It reminds me of an expensive smelling shampoo. I love but I wish I had just spent the extra $50 at the mall so I can enjoy it all day!",1
"This curler is awesome! is it tiny so i can finally take a curler in my small pocketbook ,

I don't put 5 starts because it should be of another color, because I'm not sure if i grabbed all my lashes, an since is tiny is not the easiest to maneuver.

Overall, I love it. i curled my lashes 8 hours ago and they are still perfect, without any mascara, not even Revlon's have done that.

 i am Steve's wife btw.",1
"I believe they changed their formula because this product used to work, since they've changed the package the product doesn't work anymore, i'm guessing they went the cheaper route.  Not worth it.",0
"This perfume smells nothing like the notes described.  It is not warm and spicy, and the amber and musk not come through at all.  It's floral and musty.  It smells very old to me, like something a grandmother would wear.  Perhaps it is the oakmoss scent taking over.  I definitely do not recommend it because I do not like the scent, but the fragrance does last a long time (over 12 hours on me).",0
Horrible very little scent and under 24 hours of protection,0
this lotion has a lot of good ingredients but is heavily perfumed. I put on my baby who has mild eczema and immediately noticed a whole bunch of red itchy patches within 5 minutes of applying the lotion to his body. not good for sensitive skin. i will still to his current moisturizer with no perfume. i might try the stelatopia.,0
I have a very oily face and forehead and this is one of the free face cleansers that removes all the oil without needing a lot or multiple washes,1
"Certainly not worth the money.  Very greasy and sticky.  Lacks staying power, too.",0
"Check out the video  So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So this is my opinion comparing years of using the Gillette razors vs Dollar Shave Club mid range 4x razor

"The bottle top, where the conditioner pumps out, came delivered cracked, so I cannot use the bottle.",0
"I bought this for my husband because he has very sensitive skin. Every time he shaves he would always get bumps all over his skin. He has tried different moisturizers, shavers, shaving cream, etc. and nothing help. A friend gave us a sample of this from her Ipsy bag and the first time he used it after shaving there was a huge difference. The bumps completely went away, and now he uses this daily.",1
"Love this, have been using it for years",1
I got this as a trial size from my hair dresser and this stuff is awesome. Makes my hair thicker and fuller.  I absolutely love it.,1
Wonderful,0
It doesn't go on well.  I love Yves St. Laurent Volume Effecy Faux Cils Violet.  Do not recommened.,0
I have baby fine blonde hair and all it did was pull my hair out. It wouldn't even rotate. My hair kept getting stuck in the brush and the crack where the curling portion met the body of it. I tried drying it a bit with my regular hair dryer and it was better but what's the point in using 2 devices to dry my hair? In my opinion it's a waste of money.,0
"The first shave with these is comfortable and fairly close, but they being to drag after the second or third shave. Absurdly overpriced on most websites. I'm accustomed to feathers, as perspective and I feel that the shave with Feathers is closer, about as comfortable and somehow cheaper than these.",0
It was great as long as the SPIN mechanism worked. It broke after 2 years. It was gentle with my THIN hair and shaped in only  5 minutes. I wish the rotation didn't die so quickly. I am replacing it with another brand.,1
I love Lorac! But this was a huge disappointment. It came almost dry. So sad Lora. Does not ship to FPO's otherwise I'd be ordering directly from them. THIS IS THE BEST MASCARA EVER.  I just got a bad one :(,0
"Be careful - the texture of this powder is very loose. So I ended up using fingers to apply this only to cheekbones. If you use is as powder, you'd end up needing to wash your face to re-do your whole make up. NARS' Coppacabana multiple stick is 10000 times better.",0
"This is my favorite sunscreen. It doesn't make a big mess during application. It isn't too oily or sticky or smelly. The scent is actually a pleasant citrus-like odor. You can't beat a good SPF 50 that doesn't go on like glue, is messy, sticky, and smells like chemicals. I have a can all ready for next bathing suit season already.",1
Did not work to much made me sick shakey my girl tried it did same to her,0
"Love the scent, but I've gotten burned by buying fake designer perfume  from Amazon before",1
I have been using this product for at least 3 months now. I read dozens of reviews before purchasing this product.  I've not had any problem with the unit itself as some have and I had no skin problems from using it.  The truth is it just doesn't work.  It has been a total waste of time and money.  Take my advise and take this $200+ and go to the spa!,0
"The IS clinical youth complex works wonderful! When you use it at night ,your skin looks so refreshed in the morning and younger. A very moisturizing product. I love it!",1
"This works nicely, have to apply it a little bit more than expected. Overall a good product.",1
"I really wanted to like this stuff, especially after reading all the rave reviews. I don't mind spending a little more for a quality body wash, but my issue with Molton Brown was that I had to use about twice the amount I normally use to clean my entire body. Though I only shower a few times a week, this still gets to be an unnecessary expense after a while. Plenty of other natural, manly body washes out there.",0
"Soft and gentle fragrance, works well with other scents and perfumes. Very impressed, I have ordered more than once and love the high quality of the lotion and lush feeling it leaves on my skin....I use this everyday after my  shower.",0
"I purchased this for my husband after reading the reviews. It let me down. One user said that his bar lasted over 6 months. My husband was all out of soap a few weeks later. It's like it melted in our shower and last I checked, my husband isn't excessively soaping up in the shower. Perhaps it melts in specific conditions that include a chilly, basement shower and a man with hairy legs. Perhaps. The smell was very nice so I'll give it that, but for the money, way too expensive for a disappearing bar of soap.",0
sold it on ebay,0
love it leaves my hair smooth and silky protects the hair from Heat Damage,1
"this product is so horrible for me. After I start to use it,so many acnes growing crazily on my face!",0
Loved the scent! and the longevity! Recommended,1
"I was concerned by how dark this looks but it goes on very lightly and blends easily.  I used it very lightly because I don't tend to wear much makeup, usually just mascara and lipstick.  But I found that this added the slightest touch of contouring.

My skin is medium and tends toward darker during the spring and summer,though I work at protecting my face from the sun.  This color is perfect.",1
"I didn't see a difference after using this product, we have very hard well water. My problem might need many treatments.
I do like the product in general, and my daughter has some acne around the perimeter of her scalp, it was like magic for her! She's 12, and asked me to buy more shampoo when it was gone.
Her acne seemed to disappear while using it, and acne came back when it ran out. For that reason, I'm giving it a 5 star, and buying more.",1
My order arrived promptly and was just as described.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I would purchase this perfume again.,1
"so far it seems to be working. when you buy replacement bulbs, find the ones with double pulses. This unit was chosen for the reviews and the larger working area.",1
"Not what I thought, the direction was in small print couldn't read them.",0
Love this nail polish. I have worn it more times than not already and it is my go to color of the summer.,1
"This shampoo is amazing, but whatever I got from this seller is not the Oribe I know and love. The box and bottle were just right, but the shampoo came out yellowy and runny, rather than the high-quality creamy shampoo that Oribe makes.",0
Great scent but very fleeting. I really don't think its worth it for a 2 second scent blast.,0
"Recommended by my stylist. Made my hair too flat and greasy, just didn't work with my fine hair.",0
"I had just gotten into skincare and this was one of the first toners that I bought. It works great after cleansing your face, especially if you use it with a cotton square and helps also as a physical exfoliant. I'm leaving this as four stars because while it definitely hit all the checkmarks by doing it's job as a toner and didn't break me out at all, I'm not sure I would consider it a holy grail toner and plan to try out a different toner now.",1
Not what I expected at all,0
"This is great so far! It leaves a tightening feeling on your lips after application. You do have to apply with your finger, and it is creamy, like a small jar of lotion. When I woke the next morning I could feel more smoothness overall. I will be applying at night, and I'm really enjoying the short term results of only 3 days.  Very nice product.",1
"I always use that brand, perfect for care my face and neck. But I only receive one cream. I still waiting for the others because they are in the Dhl courier, I hope to get them as soon as possible.",1
I ended up sending it back because I already had one that was the same size. I thought that the one I already had was smaller bu it wasn't.,1
This product was a waste of money. You can get better results just wetting your hair with water only or using dry shampoo. It is loaded with silicones that will way your hair down and make it greasier. Yuck,0
"Excellent hair dryer. Dries hair quickly while improving your hairs texture and condition. The only thing I don't like about it is the motor makes a sound that sounds like it is stressed at times, but compared to all other hair dryers I have owned this is my favorite.",1
lots of work for no results,0
"Product in picture is not what you get. Dont know if Rusk change there formula, but the bottle we just got says, (sulfate free) in big letters, not in picture. Very watered down and thin. It takes twice as much product to lather, vs the rusk sensories purify we are used too. I would no buy again. Seller needs to let people know, that this is not the same shampoo, they are used too.",0
It was too dark and didn't moisturize like I am looking for. I ordered as a 1 time purchase!  I did not sign up to continue receiving this.,0
love it,1
This has a bad smell once you put it in your beard. Slightly rancid smell. The bottle I bought from my barber did not do this and I used the entire bottle.,0
"My first experience with this product was when my stylist used it to puff up my short hair and give it some nice volume.  It worked brilliantly.

It makes your hair full-looking, not greasy or unwashed.

One caution, though.  It is made of propylene glycol, which the CDC lists as a toxic substance.  It is a ""synthetic liquid substance that absorbs water"" and has ill effect on your skin, kidneys, nose and lungs.  Link here: [...]

Knowing this, I don't think it would be a good idea to use this product in the future.  Use at your own risk.

Shipping caution: I ordered it from Spasourceonline, an Amazon-fulfilled retailer.  The amazon box I opened was full of white powder; the product was not well-wrapped and the top came unscrewed in transit.  So buyer beware.  Because of this, Amazon refunded my product price and shipping.  So yay Amazon.",0
"I was disappointed with this product. While it does not run, smear or smudge, it does not provide any thickening effect whatsoever.

"I will never buy it again. My wife's hair got extremely frizzy, her hair is smooth and wavy and with this mask it looks like a broom. Threw it away, one month later her hair looks good again.",0
"Did not like the smell that much, because I am pretty sensitive to any kind of oil or perfume smell and the Avene Cold Cream soap was one of them, it gave me headache. It might work for others, but not me.",0
I personally do not like this product.  I have extremely thick highlighted blonde hair.  There's not much you can put on my hair to make it greasy when styling it but this manages to leave my hair greasy and sticky.,0
I love this cream. It makes my face feel super smooth. The reason I gave it a 4 star was because it's very hard to squeeze out. I've tried sticking a pin in the tiny hole and the sharp end of my pointy sewing scissors but I still have trouble getting the cream out. I really don't want to cut into the tube because it would be hard to keep it from drying out.,1
This is the exact colour I wore on my wedding day and have been trying to track it down ever since.  I did three coats since it is a neutral colour.  Colour is soft and beautiful.,1
"This is the second time i buy this mascara. I like the ingredients it has which help to protect your lashes. It is very light, for daily use. If your are looking for a really dramatic look this is not the one.",1
I'm not impressed.,0
Well laid out and addition of cool shot eliminates the waiting for cooling,1
"DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON!!! very disappointed, I had 5 bottles from target ,and it works great for my sensitive skin.",0
"Smells really nice, feels good quality and is moisturizing without being greasy. Not sure if it actually prevents stretch marks as i think they are mostly genetic - but i don't have any. I liked it because during my third trimester i was feeling this intense burning sensation on the top left part of my bump and this cream would soothe it quiet a bit. It would not get rid of it entirely but it was definetly the one thing that helped.",1
"This smells very nice, but it doesn't work that well as a conditioner. I left it in for 4-5 minutes and combed it through with a shower
comb. The first thing I really noticed besides the fact that it felt kinda ""dry"" was that my hair tended to tangle more and it was
difficult to comb through my hair.
I have baby fine hair that I pamper and I never dye it or use a hair dryer on it. It is in pretty good condition because of the way I treat
it.
After my hair dried, I noticed that there wasn't much shine and that I had more fly away hair than usual.

I would not recommend this conditioner",0
No difference after a full bottle - nothing.  Prefer Lumene products.,0
I started using this product about 3 weeks ago. I like the product. The results are slowly showing. I use this combined with Aczone and Avene Retrinal Cream. That was the regime that my dermatologist recommended. She said I should start seeing effective results after two months. So expect a continuation of my review in about 6 weeks.,1
"The Dry Erase worked well for myself (female) and my husband.  We have been using it for about a week.  I like that it really has no lasting scent and it is non-oily and goes on very smoothly.  It does not leave my face or hands feeling wet.  It is made with Hydromanil, Ginger Root, Vitamins C & E.  Water is the first ingredient.  As I stated we have been using it for a week each and both feel that it does a great job of keeping our skin healthy looking and grease free.  My husband has fair and sensitive skin and this has not bothered him in one bit.  He says his face feels smoother.  This is high end cream with a heavy price tag.  I feel it works as well as Olay which is cheaper and thus I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.",1
"It wasn't quite the dark grey I was looking for, but it is super close. Doesn't dry that fast, so you have to have some time to let it dry.",1
"Excellent, it was on Prime which was a plus. A little goes a long way. You can find it in some salons a bit cheaper, maybe a dollar or so. I've been using this product for a few years and it's great!",1
"Light, Sat on more like thick baby powder. Not for me.",0
it is like a powder and when you apply it to your hair and try to brush it it comes right out no good the video of this product is the worst,0
"Every scent brings about a different feeling, all positive.  The disclaimer says not to use with children, however, I put a few drops in my child's bath and he loves it!  So much better in conjunction with a natural bubble bath than any other name brand bubble bath!!",1
"Day one of using this product was great. However, as the time went on my hair would get heavier and heavier and I started getting really itchy on the back of my neck. Now I have bumps that won't go away!",0
I gave it a 2 because it is NOT for anyone tan and beyond (darker). It went on smooth but it dried so quickly I had trouble spreading it around my face. It also made my skin very ghostly looking. I am a light skinned black girl. I didn't appreciate that. Tomorrow I will mix it with my neutrogena natural moisturizer which is a great product but lacking sunscreen. Hopefully I can update my review after that. I bought mines from TJMAXX.,0
I didn't realize it's for chemical treated hair. My hair is not chemical treated.,1
Wow - makes my hair styling very easy!,1
If you live in South Florida  this product provide the best coverage in this heat (SUMMER).  You don't have  to use much  and it feel great on your skins ( No Slim / No damp skin feeling ) .,1
a little hard to squeeze the liquid out. But like the shampoo,1
love this color,1
"Product was completely wasted! It should be shipped in a box not a bag. Didn't get to use the product at all, I was really excited to apply this to my baby's itchy skin I was really hoping to be able to help relieve her discomfort.",0
"Unfortunately pretty awful for me, personally. It turns my hair into hay. It sucks all the oils out of my scalp! It smells delicious, but I just can't use it. Maybe you NEED to conditioner as well? I'm not willing to get it though as it's just too expensive.",0
Ive used both On the Glow lotion and the tan towels. Trying this cream out of curiosity. The scent is definitely better than On the Glow lotion. Will review further after a few more uses.,1
"Elemis is costly, yes, but it makes the face smoother and softer than the less expensive moistures for men. After putting it on, you can feel the softness that was not there before.",1
Excellent gift for my mom. Nice fresh green tea aroma. It is perfect for every day wear.,1
"This is a great very gentle cleanser. I was using to many actives in my skincare and needed something gentle but effective, non of the drug store gentle face cleansers were working to get ss or makeup or just to make my face feel clean. This one fit the bill!
Clean with no residue left, the foaming is a bit different but once you get used to it very easy and effective!
Also use along w the clear spf and am/pm moisturizers.",1
"Great color!  I have already rec'd numerous compliments on the color and, of course, OPI is the best polish.",1
"This was a lifesaver. A family member has an anxiety issue of unconsciously pulling his hair so when the patches got bigger we had to find something to use when he goes to school. His hair is short, so spraying hairspray and lightly sprinkling these fibers on worked perfectly. We would hairspray again after the fibers and the color matched his dark brown (not quite black) hair. We are happy to find something to help during the time we're working on finding a resolution for the pulling problem but luckily these have helped avoid any school kids questions/bullying that could make matters worse. I would recommend this product for thinning/missing patches. Be careful because it does get EVERYWHERE when sprinkling but does have a long wear as long as it's not regularly touched or wet.",1
"the spray can not spray evenly,to some degree a little concentrated and mottled",0
"For a sulfate free shampoo, the lather of this is remarkable. I really like this shampoo, and I thought that my hair did too. I was not as satisfied with the cream rinse, however, or with the price of the duo. For that reason, I decided not to repurchase.",1
"A gift well received and loved, I was very proud of winning over future mother-in-law, let you know later?  Steve",1
"I love Korres products and although this product makes my skin feel great, the smell is way too strong.",1
"I like the OPI Crystal Nail File, because it is small for carrying in my handbag.  I like that is comes in a protective plastic tube.
This nail file is good for travel because it is on the small side but works well and I am pleased with the product.",1
Love Elizabeth Arden products!,1
Does not cover well - 2 coats is not enough.  My old Opi covers much better.,0
I used the same shampoo for over ten years before switching to this one.  I like it and my hair definitely feels clean after using it.,1
Makes my hair feel so smooth.  I have fine hair and don't think it's too heavy.,1
This product only lasts a few minutes.,0
"At first I was turned off by the frosted look of the polish in the bottle but was delighted to see that when applied, the 'frosted' look seems to vanish. Great color",1
Don't bother.,0
Did not work for me,0
If I had received the Stila In The Light palette I might have liked it but I received a fake version.  The shade Bubbly looks just like the shade Gilded Gold.  The shades Bare and Kitten also appear to be the same color.,0
I have very curly hair and it works awesome.... Love this product!!,1
"Silk n Blue Acne Solution Device is an amazing product that works ! My son has terrible acne on his face,he used silkn blue on one side of his face to see if it works after a few days his face looked clean and clear. It was really unbelievable!! Now he has to use it on the other side. You use it by holding it on the affected area for a few minutes then move to the next spot . It works really well and I would highly recommend it !!! It is a great product !!!",1
Used this product twice and don't see any color. If I don't see any color tomorrow I am sending it back.,0
Was disappointed it didn't apply so easily. The color was off and there wasn't distinct coverage.,0
awesome stuff,1
"I was a regular customer of this product when it was 4oz and in the squeeze bottle.  They have changed the package, raised the price and reduced the amount to 2.4oz.  It's a major price increase and I'll find an alternative after many years of using it. I understand the desire to raise price given the limited market.  I hope they understand my feedback as a customer now looking for a substitute.",0
Smaller size than I realized.,1
"I tried this out on my husband and it was something he liked. It's not like a greasy moisturizer at all. It reminds me of Smashbox's Skin Primer that I use under foundation.  After a shave, it felt really nice on his skin. Since he doesn't use anything on his skin normally, not even sunscreen, I've been trying to get him to do better. We are middle-aged now and need the help. I've given him a multitude of products that he ignores. He doesn't like the greasy feel or shine.

This fit the bill perfectly.

It does contain ""cones"" or those ingredients some people hate and consider them bad for their skin. I've not had a problem with them. It aids to that smooth feeling. Ingredient list below.  It's for sensitive skin and it is very concentrated so a pea-sized drop did his whole face.

One caveat, if you haven't recently shaved, it may not feel as good. It seems great on fresh shaved skin.

"Soaks into skin well, made my eyes feel well hydrated. Makeup could be put over without flaking.  I recommend highly.",1
Made my face break out in a rash of some kind,0
Dont last,0
Not much fragrance. Very disappointed  smell doesn't last over a few minutes. Not happy with the product  would not buy again,0
It's a mess. I'm glad that I ordered the small one. I just trashed it.,0
This was great the first day- second day it wouldn't heat up. Returning.,0
"This is one of the few ""natural"" sunscreens that don't break me out.  It's a bit thicker than I would have preferred , so it takes a while to apply evenly, but it did NOT break me out, smell funky, or leave me with a sunburn.  As a redhead, I will be repurchasing.",1
"I had this before without the ""1.0"" and loved it.  This formula is too harsh and burned my skin.",0
Best mascara out there!!!,1
good product...,1
Temperature constantly changes won't keep the set temperature,0
The pigmentation is great and I love the variety you get with this palette.,1
Luxury samples?  Not quite.  Disappointed in the quality  - nothing more than samples,0
This is one of a miracle pimple zapper. Works within few hours. You have to use sunblock when using this,1
"I really wanted this to work. I'm fair with dark hair, so the perfect candidate (I thought). I used the setting on max & barely felt any pain. At the same time I bought this, I also started getting professional laser removal on my bikini, underarms & legs (which is REALLY expensive -- but is working). I bought this to see if I could achieve similar results & same some $$ for my arms. Alas, it didn't work for me. FULL DISCLOSURE - I did not follow the instructions perfectly - so this may work for you. Also, everyone's hair/skin is different -- so you can give it a try. But I think to avoid lawsuits, the company has it at a really low power-setting (the professional ones really hurt, cause skin irritation & probably can permanently scar you). This device takes a lot of time, doesn't hurt your skin at all & doesn't seem to really impact the body hair either.

It is almost impossible to cover a large area with the device because its aperture is so small -- so I figured I would concentrate on 3 dark, thick hairs on my neck and chin. I zapped and zapped and zapped several times in a session, multiple times in a week, and several weeks in a row for months (this use is NOT per instructions - you are supposed to treat 1x every 2 weeks - and I also plucked them out after the zapping because it would drive me nuts to have those hairs on my face (which is also against instructions)). What I achieved was a slowing of growth of those hairs + they got somewhat finer. I haven't seen any difference in the hair on my arms (but I wasn't a precision user to cover the area perfectly & I can't say I did it with the same amount of frequency/ferocity as with the hairs on my chin). I wasn't expecting great results -- but I was hoping to achieve some thinning of hair on my arms & permanent removal of the hairs on my face/neck. I could have justified the expense if it got rid of the dark hairs on my face, but I can't recommend this product given my outcome.

This is a 2-star review, not a 1-star review because I didn't follow the instructions. But I don't think many people do - so I'm not willing to give it a 3-star either. I also wish I had read a review like this in the first place, because I think I wasted my money on this product (which I will still be using in the hope that with repeated zapping, I can at least get rid of these three hairs. If I ever do, I will update this review & will give it another star). Hope springs eternal!",0
Works much better than the drugstore brands.,1
"I love it! It is perfect for my hair, giving it a fullness and smoothness without curl. It heats up immedidately - no waiting for it to heat up. The handle and release clip are user-friendly. It is everything I expected and more. I highly recommend it!",1
"The John Varvatos Acqua Eau de Toilette Spray comes in a very nice box.  Once you open it up the bottle is a classy glass bottle with a type of weave around it.  Quite unique looking and pretty cool.  I'd suggest just a light spray as it is initially a pretty strong aroma, at least compared to others I've tried.  However, it tones down quickly to a nice manly smell.  The ladies in my life seem to like it and so do I.  I'd certainly consider this again among my favorite colognes.",1
Burned my hair,0
"Dealing with age related skin issues, including contact dermatitis and eczema!  Unit works great in between breakouts.",1
"If your fair skinned and need HQ free, this is the one.",1
"This is a total bust. The centerpiece continues to fall out. The only way to use this is to remove the entire piece and put just the center in. Otherwise, it does NOT stay in. Useless",0
It was ok  but it didn't work for my hair and it was high,1
Love this scent.,1
I used this product as directed and it made my hair very dry and stiff at scalp level.  I could hardly get a comb or brush through my hair close to scalp.  I had used a sulfate free cleanser for many months and my hair was in good condition but was beginning some hair loss due to thyroid problem and thought this system would help.  I am now using salon conditioners to reverse what this product has done.  I DO NOT recommend this product.,0
Has a nice scent,1
"I am a fan of quality eye creams, always have been. This was recommended by my esthestician. I was optimistic after reading reviews, but it did not work well for me. It makes the skin around my eyes dry and red. After I used it for a couple of days my skin started to peel. I stored it in the cabinet for a few months and tried adding it to my regimen again. It did the same thing. I discontinued use.",0
Works well.,1
Too light. Barely shows up so its pretty useless.,0
"This lotion is thin and drippy which makes it difficult to use. For instance, to use on your face, you must pour it into your palm, then dip your fingers into it to spread it on your face--making sure to use a small amount so the lotion does not drip off your fingers onto counter-tops, clothes, etc. My product of choice is thick enough to squeeze on my fingertips and then easily apply to my face, neck, etc.

Due to its lack of body, several thin layers are necessary for the proper amount of coverage a thicker lotion provides with a single swipe. Even if this lotion was thick, it is way over priced. Two stars only because it is not sticky or greasy after application.",0
"This product did not work at all for my hair. Smells great, but doesn't do anything close to add volume or texture. Consistently pulls my hair down and adds a significant amount of weight when added to my style. Definitely not worth the money. Extremely disappointed.",0
Very Very Gooooooood.,1
"I had such high hopes for OPI's Infinite Shine, but it is just not a good product.  I ordered the primer and top coat, plus two colors--You Can Count on It and Can't Be Beet!.  The consistency of the pink, You Can Count on It, was awful--streaky and gloppy; it left brush marks that refused to smooth out after application.  I let the first coat dry very well before applying the second coat, but it, too, left brush marks. Can't Be Beet, a dark, rich red, was better, but not great.  The pink (primer, 2 ccolor coats, and a top coat, began chipping the very next day.  What a disappointment!  I will stick to OPI Gelcolor.",0
TRIA has filed for bankruptcy and their customer service number is no longer operational.  Check their website.  DO NOT BUY,0
"I'm very satisfied with this palette because all of my other eye makeup are bright colors not suitable for the work environment, this neutral palettes can make you look lovely and professional i have warm skin tone and it works well with mine. this palette would be great for traveling because it has all the shadows you need in one. i will probably never get the naked  palette by UD as long as i have this.",1
"I want a good product, It was wrong because this Iron Curling Does not work.
for people who live outside the USA not a smart desicion making this purchase",0
My dermatologist recommended it and I've been using it ever since. Its a very light cream with a tint that doesn't clog up my pores. Nice moisturizer for the day with SPF.,1
"Pretty good, but i like the regular Davine's conditioner better -- white in a clear jar.  This left my hair in good shape and pretty much tangle free.  I have long, straightened hair.",1
I normally buy any candle that is orange or a citrusy scent and I have to say this has a chemical type smell and I can't use it in the main part of the house. I have added some essential oils and it helped a little but I would not buy this particular candle again. On the other hand the rosemary eucalyptus candle is AMAZING!,0
"I was told no Parabens, however clearly stated on the jar.  Need to have ingredients listed when buying products.  Will never buy again.",0
I love this nail polish color so much!! The color in the bottle doesn't do it justice. It's gorgeous on the nails!!,1
I have been using Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo for 8 years and this bottle seems to be different.  I don't know if Paul Mitchell changed the contents or this distributor.  I want the old formula back.,0
Not what I had expected. I thought it was for conditioning lashes or primer to protect lashes. Instead I found it to be just the opposite and I don't care for it at all.,0
"Okay, I bought this from Ulta and it was delivered today. Im seriously disappointed. I haven't even tried the products, they could be absolutely wonderful, but Im giving two stars because Im giving them the benefit of the doubt. This kit Id rate one star. I knew the products weren't full sized. I knew the facial oil was 10ml. I knew the balm was 10ml. But what I got today was 3ml of product in a 10ml bottle. Not cool. At all. Ill be returning because its just not worth the money, no matter how good it might have turned out to be. I thought maybe mine had been used or something but the products were still sealed. Attaching photos of the oil bottle with a kids medicine cup for reference. The medicine cup is easily twice as big around as the facial oil bottle. 10ml of product would fill the oil bottle completely, not just 1/3 of the way. ",0
"The only reason this gets two stars is because it has a decent SPF.  As a primer, I hate it.  It's either gone too dry or it's ""normal"" for it to be very difficult to get out of the container.  I do NOT recommend!  I should have returned it.",0
"Purchased this product in two colors. I liked them at first, but after having them for only 3 months, both have dried out and are unusable. What a waste of money! I have a multitude of eyeliners from many other brands and non have dried out like this junk. I store them in a makeup case along with my other ones, so it's not my storage method it's this product. The colors were nice and the product was ok, nothing special however after being unusable after three months I would not repurchase. I'm dissapointed with the quality of this brand, and I have bought other products from this line.:(",0
hope it will work well... we'll see,1
"I bought this lotion for my mother , she was complaining about having extremely dry skin . I decided to give it a try , and my mom so far loves it she said that it made her skin instantly soft . It absorbs to the skin pretty fast . My mom had also notice that her skin had gotten more firm . The only problem I'm having with this product is that is too pricey.  I'm giving 4 stars because it's too expensive .",1
"the best shampoo i ever used.  hair is shiny and manageable
All daughters and sons now want this shampoo all the time",1
"This product is the BEST!! I have sensitive skin, which has been scarred by acne. While I no longer breakout, I still have the unsightly scars. Well, I did, until I began using these pads once a day. They not only make your skin feel smooth as butter, they've managed to get rid of my dark marks far faster than using the expensive department store products.

Some people on here say that it's made their pores smaller. This hasn't been my experience. My pores aren't larger, they just aren't any smaller. Perhaps, I should start using the pads less? I have sensitive skin and over exfoliation can make your pores inflamed, which make them larger.

This treatment will burn a bit upon initial application after you've been using it for awhile. It's only temporary. If you don't feel as though you can handle the tingle, don't use the pads everyday.

***KEEP AWAY FROM YOUR EYES*** I read someone say that it made their wrinkles/fine lines fade... I rubbed a pad on my under eye area for 2 days and by the third, I had a NEW fold under my eyes! I'm in my twenties and only had 1 barely visible line before. I stopped using it under my eyes  and about 4 days later, my eye area was normal again. Glycolix Elite makes products for your eyes and if you're actually having wrinkle issues, I'd suggest those as this product is too strong to be used on your sensitive eye area... especially if you already have sensitive skin like moi.

Using these pads have given me so much confidence that I don't have to fret about slathering on concealer and foundation before being seen in public! They've also saving me the expense of going to the dermatologist to have laser treatments on my face and neck to remove those spots.

When I first started using the pads, I used them twice a day (mornings and nights) for about 5 days. Then, 2x a day was unbearable and I changed to only applying at night, before bed.

I deducted a star because this is my 3rd jar of these pads and I cannot seem to figure out a way to keep them from getting mold/mildew on the inner cap. They remain upright in a dry cabinet, yet the cardboard liner in the jar's lid soaks up the product on the pads. I tried to resolve this issue by cutting a piece of foil and inserting it in the cap, but that's when the mildew came. I had all of the ""treatment"" still in my pads, but a cap with mildew. Eww.",1
If you have sensitive skin I would advise not to use. My skin started peeling and felt a burning sensation after only a drop. Photos attached,0
Bought this after seeing big boycott of this company in the news. Decided to support it by buying a product. Also imagining dead sea mud has some cool properties.... Ended up getting this on autoship. Package is a one use product for me. Cover your whole body and let dry(avoid face it stings a little)Let dry COMPLETELY then rinse off(this takes a while)Make sure you have the time to do this. Nice once a month treat for me and I have given it also as a gift. Reminds me of the marcella borghese fango mud I used to buy years ago...Sort of a cheater-spa thing if you can't go to the dead sea yourself...,1
"Amazing shave, I switched to using a safety razor last year but was not happy with the shaving cream I bought at Target. After reading the reviews on Proraso I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did. Every shave is refreshing, close and no cuts. Shaving is no longer a task, I look forward to it in the morning.",1
Great price,1
I used to purchase this at a local store and it got discountinued and I'm so glad I found it thru this site because my face looks just amazing after using it.,1
Tried it but doesn't give results I was hoping for. Very disappointed especially at that price.,0
Very disappointed! I just opened it and the bottle was open and the hair powder is all over and about half gone!,0
"I like the pen, and the product goes on easily, but it doesn't last very long. I feel like I have to reapply by lunchtime. Disappointing.",0
Had the opposite affect for my hair - made it limp and kinda oily.,0
"I was very happy with the scent and lather of this soap and I'm always looking for something new to change it up. However, buyer beware I believe this soap dried the skin on my hands so badly it peeled off an entire layer and lasted for about a month. After 3 days of use I noticed the change in my skin I stopped the soap use immediately. I can't prove it truly is the soap but it was the only thing I changed in my hygiene before the skin changes occurred. I had to throw the soap away which was a bummer for such pricey product. If you have sensitive skin be careful before you buy. I am not knocking the company or product it just sucked to have my hands for like this for over a month because of the potential cause from the use of this soap. Amazon was very understanding and supportive and Thank You!",0
"Tan Towel Express Tan is an excellent product and that is what is advertised with regard to my review. I thought I was purchasing Tan Towel Express (read the description; why would I think otherwise?) and what I received was Tan Towel Tanning Mist - two totally different products. When I went to request return/refund, I was informed that neither option was available. Again, excellent product - I question the seller and Amazon. I am stunned that I cannot return for a refund when what was advertised was not what was shipped.",0
"35 lb weight gain and a 9 lb baby and I have zero stretch marks! I neglected to use the product on my breasts and got some stretch marks there, so I feel pretty strongly that this works! Its light, non-greasy and smells amazing. Worth every penny!",1
"I don't have any special problems with my skin, and I've used commercial soaps without incident. This one didn't work for me.

After shaving, I washed my face using this soap. The first thing I noticed was the smell. It reminded me of Jergen's hand lotion, a product I hadn't smelled in at least 20 years. The second thing I noticed was that my face felt warm, and not in a comfortable way. There wasn't anything approaching pain or serious discomfort, but I wasn't expecting this feeling. (Oddly, I didn't feel anything on my hands, which I used to apply the soap.) Subsequent trials resulted in the same outcome. I haven't noticed any effect in terms of softness or other improvement to the skin.

I also have to question the packaging. This soap is more like a paste than a cream. I don't say that it's too thick, but I have to wonder why it comes in a reasonably hard plastic bottle and not in a tube that is easier to squeeze. I have serious doubts about being able to get the soap out when the bottle is less than half full.",0
"This is not a color for brown skin girls (Kerry Washington, Nia Long)  It doesn't work as contour or a bronzer.  Just makes your face look dirty.
Not sure what completion this will work for but it surely is not for me.",0
"I had hope for this product as a fair skinned person. However, it does have a self-tanner scent despite the claims of included de-odorizers. Also, the instant color looks tan when initially applied. However, when I wash my face the recommended 12 hours later, it appears I haven't self tanned at all. I tried by applying daily for a week, but really don't look any tanner. For the price point and described quality, I don't find it worth a purchase and will be returning.",0
"Makes my hair feel rough and coarse. I have an almost full bottle that I will never use.  I am just using it until my other heat protectant comes in the mail.  I don't know how well this spray does at protecting hair from heat, but it makes my hair feel dry and rough.  My hair is much softer when it dries without this product in it.  It even makes my hair more difficult to comb through once the spray dries in my hair.  I don't like it at all!",0
"The temperature control isn't consistent or accurate. Even on the lowest setting, it heats up way too hot for my hair and is steaming while using it. I've had the same product for 20 years and never had this issue before. I'm afraid to use it.",0
I have very sensitive skin and live in a dry climate.  This product is amazing and doesn't cause me breakouts or anything.  Adds a nice glow and moisture to the skin.  Great base moisturizer anytime of day.  Really nice under makeup. Love it.,1
"I've had KP since I was about 12 (I'm 28 now) and I recently tried KP Duty. I am absolutely *shocked* that a product that makes such brazen claims can be so ineffective.  The bottle actually has a cartoon CHICKEN on it, says it ""Effectively eliminates"" the bumps, and that ""Flawless"" skin is achievable.

  I have KP all over my legs; most of it is not inflamed, but there are a couple patches that are reddened.  I also have very fair skin (transparent, basically) and the KP looks bad enough that no one has seen my legs at all since I was 12.  (Insert complete social isolation and low self esteem HERE !)  So I was so happy to see that this ""KP Duty"" product was formulated specifically for this disease, and I really thought it would work.  Well, I've used it once a day for a month now and have noticed no reduction in the bumps or the red spots or the redness generally.  The skin does *feel* much softer, but it's as ugly as ever, and the bumps are obvious when you look at the skin in profile.

  I have no clue how long you're supposed to use this product before you see results.  They say you should try any new skin product for at least 6 weeks before you give up, so I think I will keep at it for a while longer.  But I'm assuming now that all of the raving reviews this product gets are due to its skin-softening effect, not ANY actual treatment of KP.  As Jay mentioned, any lotion can provide softer skin without the $35 price !!

  I have noticed within the past week or so that the ankle/calf region has started peeling.  I hope this is a good thing (exfoliation?) and maybe if it continues there could be some better skin revealed underneath.  However, so far even the peeling areas still have red, KP spots!

  Will post another review here if the product does turn out to be effective, but don't hold your breath, folks.",0
"Got my replacement order and wish I had played with it when it initially arrived! I planned to wear this on a cruise with an outfit that has various shades of mauve, along with my Burberry Sheer Mulberry eyeshadow, I was going to be gorgeous.....so I thought. Good news is that the seller shipped it out very fast and I am thankful for that. I was so excited about this color because the color swatches looked perfect for what I had planned to do with my eyes. That said,I opened my brand new Mac 227 brush to apply the color and it is nothing like I expected on. It's muuuuuch too light and barely definable on me, looks more like a very sheer tinted shade of satiny mauve. The color may work on fairer skin tones, but not for me, this will be a highlighter under the brow ON ME, but that's the ONLY reason I'm unhappy with the product because Jouer makes beautify eyeshadows and the Seller was very accommodating! I give it 2 stars because it will be an over-priced brow highlighter now.",0
"I purchased this item as a gift.  When it arrived the box was NOT sealed in plastic.  It appeared to have been opened.  It is NOT suitable as a gift, therefore I completely wasted my money.",0
"In this package you get a facial soap, toner, and lotion.

These products arrive in a brown box, and I mention this for those who might be considering gifting a man in your life. On the one hand the brown box isn't too frou-frou --so no guy-shock. And yet on the other hand it's not exactly 'special' --so they may wonder about how much you like them.

As for the products they were very nice. For this review I tested them along with my husband. My signif-other thought that the facial wash was a bit drying --but it has been a harsh winter, so this might be fine for summer. The toner reminded me of all the less expensive toners that I've purchased for my daughter and myself. It's translucent blue and minty.

The best part was the lotion. My husband really liked it, and so did I. It has very little scent and it isn't greasy. A really lovely light lotion. Next would be the toner. While it reminds me of other toners --as I mentioned-- it doesn't seem to leave a residue that needs to be washed off.

This collection is a relative bargain for Baxter of Cali. It would probably be best appreciated by someone who still has oily skin",1
"I do my own nails at home and love CND Shellac. It is a great prodct and truly does last at least 14 days. My nails always look amazing and I get a ton of compliments. I also love the colors and the option to layer and create new colors is awesome.

This is an effect. It is a clear polish with a gold glitter effect .",1
"I ordered this because it was supposed to be long lasting. It wasn't so for me, and I was very disappointed because the color (amore) is gorgeous.",0
Every single time I used this it lost brissels. I threw out. Waste of money.,0
The best.,1
"I did not like the smell of this, it kinda smelled like glue. It seemed to lather good and it gave good protection. But I couldn't get it off my face fast enough because of the smell.",0
"I really tried to match my skin tone with the swatch but it ended up not even close. Color aside the coverage is excellent. I have a deep boxcar acne scar on my back. It is very different in color from my normal skin tone. This product completely flattened out the discoloration. If it had been a good color match, this would have met my needs 100%.

I'd have to see the colors in person to make a better match. I was way off.",1
haven't seen any huge changes yet but I like it,1
This is a wonderful sun screen. It goes on easily and rubs in quickly. It also works great.,1
"This is the best foundation I have been able to find.
It reduces discolorations, and the matte finish helps minimize wrinkles and
acne scars.
I use it along with J.I.'s finishing spray,  D2O Hydration Spray.

J.I. Mineral Powder gives you a natural look, as well as an SPF of 20.",1
"This has a skin irritating chemical called cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) so it will cause skin irritations on the baby and is possibly carcinogenic with its impurities. If your child has eczema or dermatitis, do not use this product. It has sodium myreth sulfate which is similar to laureth sulfate and also has fragrance so I would never use this on my baby and am throwing it away. False advertising by Mustela when it says ""Priority given to ingredients of natural origin.""",0
"Fake, I've been buying this for three years, this gave me rashes. Very fake",0
"I think it is misleading to call this ""shower oil"". It is very soapy/sudsy and I haven't found it to be particularly helpful in preventing or soothing dry skin. Also, note that it comes in a glass bottle, which probably isn't a great idea in a shower. The fragrance is (pleasantly) light.",0
"My skin is very sensitive to chemical sunscreen, but I hoped this highly rated stuff would be an exception. It's French, right?? But it smells very strongly of sunscreen, doesn't absorb well, leaves an oily finish, and, worst of all, redness and stinging that lasts for a couple of hours. In short, for my sensitive skin, it is no different from much less expensive chemical face sunscreens.",0
wrong color  much too dark..i started with the screen light brown..when ti switched over to choices and prices it decided to make all of those darkbrown and I foolishly did not notice it...so we are stuck with it.,0
"This item came in a tiny tube instead of a jar. It is a chemical peel and not a peel off mask, which should be specified. However, it did not do anything for my skin other than leaving it burning. I returned this product.

"I had been wanting to try tinted moisturizer for a long time but never wanted to risk wasting money for something that I wouldn't like. I finally risked it after reading some online reviews and I really LOVE Balmshelter! I have a light olive skin tone and I ordered the Light/Medium shade. It's perfect. I didn't tell my husband that I was using another makeup, and within 2 days of wearing this, he told me that I looked like I had a nice glow :) I told him that, no, I was not pregnantI was using a new makeup. He approves. My brother also told me that I looked like I had a nice tan. Two compliments in just a few days of wearing this - I think that's a good sign. If you have been considering trying a tinted moisturizer, TRY THIS ONE! :) I think you'll like it a lot!",1
"It's not Iike a cream,kind of dry and the package is very small like a mini size",0
I loved paul mitchel until i saw the toxic rating for this. Totally freaked me out. I highly recommend everyone scan in products on the ewg app and learn about what you are putting onto and into your body. This is highly toxic but cruelty free. It was a great purple shampoo option for me before i knew how poisonous it was.,0
good,1
"I really like the product because it is great for styling but dislike the scent. If they had this unscented it would be perfect. Besides the smell that I don't care too much for, I really like the durability of the product. When I went on vacation, I would step out of the shower put this product in my hair when it was dry and I was good to go. Unless it was windy or I went for a dip in the ocean my hair stayed in place all day. I literally use this product almost every day. You don't need a lot and a little goes a long way. The best way I can describe this product is that it's like crazy glue for your hair, without the stiffness. I can highly recommend this product and I hope that one day they make this product in a scentless version. I hope my review aided in your search for the perfect hair product, and if you found it helpful please click ""yes"" below. Thank you!",1
This is THE BEST product to use on thin whimpy hair to give it lift and volume! Just amazing!!,1
Smells wonderful. We've been using this since our daughter was a newborn and will use it indefinitely! The quintessential baby scent!,1
"I had high hopes this would really work for me.  I've had kp on the backs of my legs (thighs) since my early 20's.  Not really sure where it came from although I suspect an allergy to friction/irritation from clothing dyes and sweating in pantyhose (which I no longer wear).  But I've had sensitive skin all my life.

Anyway, I used the product (easy to use), no overwhelming perfume scent, etc. as the directions instructed.  The kp did not get better with time.  I gave it 2 stars since it did seem to lessen the kp's redness.  I wish the results were positive for me but I cannot recommend this product.",0
Been using this for years...I have very thin hair and use these fibers....in the thin areas and it covers up very well!!!,1
"I am returning bottle I just purchased.  I made sure to check for an expiration date on the bottle when I purchased, and could not find one.  The liquid turned yellow about 3 days after receipt.  This is the 2nd bottle this has happened to - I did not return the first one.  Pretty spendy for this to be happening.  It's unfortunate as I have used this in the past and loved how it made my skin look and feel.  Not sure what is going on with this product as my last 2 bottles have been defective.",0
love this,1
My dermatologist recommends this. Love the results.,1
"I fell in love with Yves Saint Laurent's Paris Roses enchantees when I was fifteen. It was my first rose perfume: crisp and airy and romantic- not too sweet, not stale or rotten, and NOT your grandmother's rose. I was lonely, it was summertime, and I was in Paris. But I had love, bottled in a precious cut glass bottle. It all ended of course,  and I mourned the day I squeezed the last drops of that loveliness from its bottle. The perfume lingered on my scarves and sweaters long after, taunting me.

So I have hunted in vain to fill its void in my life, and have settled on L'occitane's Rose 4 Reines for now. It is a different kind of rose, not laced with cool misty garden air and old books and wet bark, but it is fresh smelling and it doesn't pickle on my skin. It's affordable, and comforting, and its only two drawbacks are its packaging which resembles complimentary hotel shampoo and its tendency to fade off quickly. It leaves behind a warm feminine smell though.",1
Crazy strong. Dries out scalp so much...,0
I don't think this flat iron is the real deal.  It straightens like a generic flat iron.,0
"This is my second tin of L'Occitane Shea Butter.  It is amazing.  At around forty bucks a can, it should be.  You use it sparingly, and it is great on lips, face, winter feet, hair.  It's just a great product to have around.  It lasts and lasts, so it's worth the price.",1
"Not a fan. Makes my hair fly away and unkept looking. I get better results with a $6 bottle of Walmart special, honestly.",0
"Works great to provide body and deal with frizz.  These rollers are heavy, and stay put best with the clamps on anything other than the top of the head. I like that they are all large as I am not looking for curl, mostly lift and body.  I was happy enough, my only wish is that they be lighter weight.",1
Wifey says I smell like black pepper after using this soap. she hates it and I also don't believe it's worth the price.,0
Everything was ok. The purchase arrived on time.,1
"This stuff stinks! I don't mean it's bad I mean it actually smells horrible. It has a disgusting smell you cannot get away from. Also it doesn't make your hair shine, it sprays on like Hairspray absolutely do not recommend I threw it away.",0
Scent is amazing.,1
It[s powder without an applicator and I think that's a ripoff. Why sell something that you cannot use without buying something else? You don't.,0
"After a 2 days of using this, I Goodwill'd my Clarisonic and Neutrogena devices. The Clarisonic was too harsh and seriously a lot of pieces and the Neutrogena never cleaned my face fully. It's not like I wear a lot of makeup and the Neutrogena was so easy to travel with, but now that's been replaced by the Luna 2. It keeps a charge (it's been over 3 weeks now and I've only charged it once.), packs easily, and works great.",1
I liked it but it did not hold a charge. I returned it.,1
"Love this stuff light & provides coverage
Ouse it during the summer",1
"The container is only half way full! I have had good results ordering in the past but not this time. Would love a replacement please, this is ridiculous for the money spent!",0
"Great application, and I really love the color! It's really unique when compared to similar shades I own. I don't think you'll regret buying this shade. Mature but still fun!",1
"It is a great cologne but way, way to expensive.
Triple the amount it actually costs!",0
"I love the citrus smell.
I have fairly oily hair. This removes the oily feeling with one wash.
Doesn't take a large amount to lather up nicely.

My wife doesn't like it because it dries out her scalp.

Overall, this is my favorite shampoo. I would love to find something less expensive that works exactly like this- and smells the same. Until then,  this is my shampoo.",1
Doesn't smell like the other unite products. Overpriced for a fragrance-free dry shampoo.,0
It is good but not really worth the price.,1
"Too much hand presser to get iron to close on hair. GET READY to have Carpal tunnel syndrome soon with this one! I hate it.. also it went out on me basically the digital sensor has malfunctioned and goes on an off to sleep and back on while in my hand while doing a client! I am returning it ( I brought it directly from FHI) going to see of they will replace it with the Nano Titanium Professional Hair Straightener (1"") I don't care if it is a more less expensive iron an I don't get any difference back I cannot afford for this to happen to me again. It is not the quality I am use to from FHI. I had the first limited addition EPS Titanium Professional Hair Straightener (1"") used it for years before it went out on me... an it would still work if I could have the cord replaced for that reason alone I won't throw it out... Im keeping hope alive i can fix it I LOVED that iron! This one not so much.",0
No big deal!  Won't buy it again !,0
"I tried shopping locally for this item for my daughter in-law for Christmas.  Sally Hassen had two in stock in the back room.  She brought one out, told me they were a 'special buy' and there were only two left.  Hhowever, she also said that since there were only two left, that the purchase would be unrefundable.  The sales price was full price, $40.  I explained to her that if it were on clearance, say 75% off, then I would risk her no refund policy.  I cannot fathom anyone selling an item at full price and saying it is unreturnable!

I came straight home and ordered this one from this seller.  Thank you, great product!",1
I bought this product last week to my wife and it was very disappointing when I received it and she realized that the expiration date has expired since last year (06/17).,0
"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1
"Good stuff. Too much will be hard to rub in and will leave your face a little greasy looking, but that's true of any sunscreen.",1
I love this polish! The color is gorgeous and it spread very easily which is super helpful. I wash my hands a lot at work so unfortunately this polish didn't hold up for more than a couple of days. But I still recommend it!,1
I have been using glycol acids as a facial cleanser for over 7 years now and this is the first product that highly irritates my skin.  Even one use of the product leads to heated and irritated skin.  I was also disappointed to see Sodium Laureth Sulfate as one of the ingredients.  Back to DDF's GA cleanser.,0
"Ordered this and received a completely different product, not even the same brand. Sadly, I was deployed overseas and was unable to initiate an exchange at the time.",0
"the best hand cream I have used, goes into the skin and softens it, my husband is a great user of it too.",1
"I absolutely loved the way this nail polish looked on, and got it in other colors! I wore it all the time for a few weeks, and then all of a sudden my nails were constantly breaking and very weak! Because of the matte style, it is not supposed to be used with a base coat. I found once I stopped using this nail polish and went back to OPI my nails stopped breaking. It is too bad because it looked great!",0
"I love it, really leaves my hair as it I had a keratin treatment for days!!...",1
"I have used this product in the past and loved it.  When I developed an adverse reaction to my sunscreen I decided to try Elta.  It is wonderful!!  It is lightweight, nongreasy, and works better than other products.  My skin has cleared up from my prior allergy and I will use this from now on.",1
Husband loves it!,1
Good product and good seller. I highly recommend them,1
This nail polish is a deep dark purple not navy at all.,0
"i like this project. it is really gentle to the skin. however, i feel that you can also get the same thing by using cetaphil -- at a lower price! anyway, this is good though.",1
While I don't usually use contouring shades except on my eyes this is a great trio of shades. The powders are soft and silky and blend easily. My only complaint would be if I am going to spend this amount on make-up it should either have a brush to apply with or at least a place in the compact to put your own.,1
I think I got a bad batch.  I've been using this for about a year and loved it.  This new bottle makes my eyes water and itch! Real shame considering how expensive it is.,0
"This hurt my head when using. Bristles might be too hard and large. I have another with smaller and softer bristles, bought this cause thought it would work better and it looks better. The look is about the only good thing about this.",0
"I have a question why it is cheaper then the original web site in ck.com it costs $70
 and here it's less then $50
Is there some think wrong ???and not just this most of the perfumes in the web are like that ? Why ???",1
"I started using Jane Iredale tinted moisturizer in 2009 and remain a happy and loyal customer. It was especially important that the product was light and not oily. I hadn't been that good about wearing sunscreen, but things deemed necessary, and this was just right for someone like me. I use the medium light - am somewhat fair - and it works well.",1
the spray tool can be improved! it get stack from time to time,1
"Beard lube makes a perfect gift for Father's Day, birthdays, Christmas, or even as a stocking stuffer... I buy it for my husband, my dad, and my brother. They all absolutely love this product!!!!! All three have sensitive skin, with coarse thick hair. When they use this product they have clean & smooth shaves. A little goes a very long way, and this sized bottle is a great value. Again, this review should be 5 stars, but while one bottle was wrapped very nicely and did not leak the other wasn't and leaked out into the box. Thankfully not a lot leaked out, but it is still frustrating with such a great product.",1
"Ths is a very overpriced dry shampoo. It was my failure to read further, but i was looking to replace a different Unite product used to control frizz and flyaways. That is NOT the purpose of a dry shampoo, so the about the product is rather deceptive next to a picture where the words dry shampoo do not show. Again, I should have read further, but usually product descriptions tell me what I need to understand the basic product i am ordering.",0
"I can't get excited about this expensive conditioner.  First of all it comes with a spout cap that is a total joke because the stuff is so thick you can barely get any out even with the cap totally removed.  Second, my hair looks and behaves no differently than when I use an ordinary conditioner.  Bottom line: it's more expensive and less effective than it's worth.  Don't waste your money.",0
"This Rita Hazan Ultimate True Color Shine Gloss....didn't do anything special for my hair, it didn't curb the brassiness and didn't give me any shine. I won't buy again.",0
This product is what I was looking for. I was trying to find a good facial sunscreen that wasn't totally white on your face and that wasn't gluey or sticky. This product is none of those things. The tint is perfect for my skin tone (medium with neutral/olive undertones). But I think it could have a large range of working for different skin tones because it's so light and doesn't really go on as color. Very liquidy which makes it easy to rub in and blend. Doesn't smell great but I'd rather that than have added fragrances for no reason.,1
Not stay that long,0
Great exfoliant and leaves skin hydrated after using; high quality item.,1
I really like the smell and even hold of this wax.  Would use it 100% of the time if it were more matte and had less shine.,1
"I'm spoiled. I can't use anything else. This stuff is not only great, but it makes your hair smell like Christmas",1
"You invested in your Clarisonic ... and in yourself! So, while I know that these heads are a little expensive, they are also the best. (There is no doubt.)

As you would expect, the fit with this authentic head is just perfect (you aren't going to get that with a knock-off or generic head ... and the real worry is what it is doing to the actual Clarisonic). Likewise, the quality is outstanding. Again, the plastic is durable (it cannot be bent or folded or dented like the generic, low-quality heads). And the head itself has thick, even, gentle bristles (these precise bristles are what keep your skin glowing!).

These heads are what makes your Clarisonic amazing! They are as important as the Clarisonic itself. And this one for sensitive skin is outstanding! It cleans without irritating! And that's no minor feat!

If you have sensitive skin and use a Clarisonic, give this a try. If you compare it to the standard brush head, you really will notice a difference. And, I cannot say this enough ... buy the really thing! There's no comparison!",1
"This is a great facial spray. Even if the ingredients aren't ""all natural"" it smells great and makes my face feel nice and fresh",1
I use this product since i got here in United States. It makes my facial skin looks younger and lovely.,1
Did nothing for me. I'll go back to my original brand.,0
The Archipelago Mango Tangerine Reed diffuser I purchased from Lucca had very little fragrance.  I have purchased this product before from other sellers and have enjoyed it.  I requested to have it replaced but my request was denied because I had used the product and did not have the original box.  It is impossible not to use a Reed Diffuser product to determine that it is defective.  I do not recommend purchasing any products from Lucca.,0
"I didn't buy this product on amazon but I felt like I had to review it since it is doing such an amazing job taking care of my eczema. I've had atopic dermatitis my entire life (I'm 25 yrs) and have crises on and off, using corticoid creams to get through them and not thinking about the harm they were doing to my body and how they are not a long term solution. My eczema gets very very bad in hot weather, specially when I sweat, and having lived in cold weather my entire life this wasn't a huge issue except on holidays, until I moved to hot weather a few weeks ago... I had the worst crises I've had in my entire life, for the first time I felt depressed because of my allergy, I was so uncomfortable, itchy and swollen but didn't want to resort to corticoids since I need a permanent solution and I am all about putting natural things in and on my body. I was about to give up when a friend recommended this cream, she said she used it on her babies and it worked great. I was a bit skeptical since it so clearly states it is for children, however I was desperate and went ahead and bought it. It's been only two days and I can't even tell you how better my skin looks. My eczema is starting to clear up and the itchiness is so much better, nothing had ever worked so well! I thought it'd be useful to state THAT THIS CREAM WORKS WONDERS ON ADULTS AS WELL since I couldn't find a review where an adult had tried it. It is also working pretty well on my boyfriend who has psoriasis, just in case it helps anyone.",1
"I've been a fan of Ahava since I lived in Israel in the 90s.  This stuff is the best!  My skin is so dry in the Chicago winters, and this lotion is just what the doctor ordered to make my skin feel smooth and healthy again.  Great, fast shipping... huge bottle for a great price.  And the pump feature is great too- easy breezy!",1
Good product. I have an oily skin and it does not leave it greasy. It has a matte finish. I don't give it five stars because I feel a little itch in the face.  I hope that's just because it's winter and my face gets dry. This is the first time I am using it.,1
"I purchased the Tria hoping it would work at least ok.  I have had laser hair treatments and usually after those treatments, most people have bald spots because of hair falling out.  I have used the trio several times but still do not have any visible results. It says you will have hair falling out after a week and I ave not had that. The highest setting has a little sting but no where near the level of professional treatments.  I tend to get annoyed using the tria because sometimes when you place it on the skin, it flashes but other times it doesn't.  It doesn't seem like it is worth this amount of money.  I guess it would be okay for touch ups after you have had real laser hair treatments but as a primary treatment I just don't see this actually being effective.",0
Great,1
it is just too bulky and heavy  to operate,0
"Great product, meets my expectations",1
I am warning you now! My friend and I both bought this product. We loved it at first but then mine broke. I called clarisonic and to my dismay my serial number did not match ANY in their system! It is a knockoff! Do not purchase from amazon! Buy direct from  clarisonic or an authorized seller.,0
Way better then any of the canned stuff,1
"I mix this product with the Wio Strait Balm and it works great for me, keeps my frizz down and makes my hair shiney and manageable.",1
Not my favorite.,0
"Love the texture, and how well it works with make up - perfect primer. It's not greasy, and doesn't cause breakouts (have combination skin). But it doesn't seem to be enough for me, at least not for my face, I had to switch to spf 70. I've been using retinol products all winter, and have fair skin so being super sensitive to sun, I did get a slight burn within 3 hours being out in the spring sun. I stopped using retinol products and will only get back to it in the winter, but felt it's best to be safe and keep using spf 70. I use this serum now on my neck, decollete, and hands etc - it works great.",1
"I thought I'd love this brush since it was more expensive than a lot of my other brushes, but I don't.  I use it occasionally just so I don't feel like I wasted my money, but it's one of the last eyebrow brushes I reach for.  It's a well-made brush, but the head of it is wider than I like and it's also too long for me.  If you like the features that I dislike than it's a great brush for you.  The brush's description made me think the bristle end would be more narrow than it is, so I end up using one of my old eyebrow brushes instead of this one.",1
Very sad I didn't pay any attention to the one star reviews before purchasing. My product was also counterfeit. Seal was reglued and the product itself was definitely not the real PCA face wash. I had gotten a travel size from the actual website to try and it was amazing. Tried to save just a little by buying off of amazon but I should have just spent a few more on the actual website.,0
"Lasted about a week which I loved. It takes a few coats to get an opaque finish but is a sweet, delicate pink.",1
"My hubby loves this product.  This product is not always available at local department store, so this gives me a better option to purchase online.",1
way too drying,0
"Easy to reach roots, hears up quickly. The name rubbed off the top within one use though. Overall all good",1
"just as good as their normal gel, but this one has a cologne smell that isn't for me.",1
Leaves your skin feeling very greasy after use. Would not buy again.,0
Didn't create the healthy shine and styling difficult. Trying the 3700,0
"I like this product. It makes my skin clean and fresh, but not too dry. And I love the smell of this product, very natural. Love it!",1
Great price!!,1
nothing special about this.  just shiny lotion.,0
"This smells sooo good. Throughout the day I catch whiffs of it, and it does not get old. It's my new favorite scent.",1
Well not waterproof.... It runs and smears after just a couple hours of use,0
It seems to be an old bottle as it does not go on smoothly and looks like it has bumps or air bubbles in it. Disappointing b/c it is a pretty shade.,0
This product is a total fake. I thought the price was too good to be true and I was right. It smelled funny as soon as I opened it and it does not go on smooth with the brush the way the real Jane Iredale does. What a scam and I fell for it. This is not the real deal and I'm sad that this exists. I will never order from this seller again.,0
"Top line: A terrific scent that just doesn't hang around very long.

Good: The Molton Brown Black Pepper scent is one of the best, subtle yet sumptuous smells I (and my lady) have ever come across. That scent is realized masterfully in this cologne from Molton Brown. I've never had a negative comment (and received quite a few compliments along the way).

Bad: The scent simply doesn't linger. I'm all for subtle, and prefer a scent that only kicks in when your companion is close. But I also want a cologne that will at least last the night (4-6 hours). This one is often gone in 2 hours. Pump directly onto your neck for best lengthening results.

Other: Molton Brown products fall on the high end of the price scale--this one being a cologne that you use sparingly makes it much more reasonable than other frequent use products, like their body wash or antiperspirant.",1
"I really had high hopes for these products, but there's just nothing to brag about.  The tube items appeared to be watered down or underfilled.  Definitely did not get my money's worth with this product.",0
"I was so excited for this curling iron to ship after I ordered it.  I had never spent so much on a curling iron before but it looked and sounded like it would be the best.  I was poring over the reviews for this one as well as several others. I have a lot of hair that holds a curl (usually) all day long and wanted a fatter iron for bigger curls.  Well, this one is fatter, but my curls don't last more than 20 minutes after I leave the house! I have used product to help them stay, hair spray, not touching them until they have cooled - nothing helps.  I've even turned the heat up and left the hair in the iron longer, to no avail.  I'm on the lookout again for another iron...This time I may pick a metal one as opposed to the ceramic coated kind - my old metal one made curls that lasted all day long.

The weight of this curling iron is awesome though...and I love how the cord isn't stuck in place so when you're curling, the cord doesn't impede you.

Just very bummed out about this purchase...",0
"Have not used it yet, but  I know I am going to love it",1
Have used this before.  It's great!,1
"I absolutely love the nail polish, but the first time you open it, there is a plastic, sticky seal attached to the lid of the actual bottle. When I removed it, it left the bottle sticky. So I had to buy Goo-Gone to remove it. This happened on all of 3 bottles I bought. They charge good money for the nail polish, which I'm not complaining about, but come on, for what you charge, I shouldn't have to scrub the outside of the bottles. I will look around for other nail polish in the future.",1
"I fell in love with this lip balm when I found it in a goodie bag given business class fliers on British Airways.  For a while I resisted buying it because I thought it pricey, then finally succumbed.  It's the best I've found so far.",1
I usually buy this product from Ulta but decided to buy thru Amazon and i still had some left from my old bottle and I noticed the color was different also when i used the one i bought from amazon it burned the heck out of my eyes and i could not open them they stung so bad my daughter used it too and she said the same thing and the one we buy form Ulta is very gentle and mild and does not burn at all i can even open my eyes. I am not sure if this is a true product would like a refund. I refuse to use!!!,0
"Klorane makes the best dry shampoo I have ever used so I finally bought some of the natural tint since I'm a brunette. Alas, since I'm also graying pretty heavily I'm not such a huge fan of the tinted version. It makes my gray look weird. Will probably go back the the untinted next time I purchase.",1
Smells great and makes my hair so soft I rarely put any product in it now.,1
"This fragrance seems lighter than the department store toilett.  It also doesn't last long.  My husband has used it several times, after a hour the fragrance is barely there.",0
Could be just me but this made my hair greasy and heavy. Ended up flat and feeling dirty. I had bad luck with their cleansing conditioner also. So perhaps it's just me. I like many other matrix products however.,0
Thank you,1
Leaves my hair dry and damaged. Not sure why this is so expensive but I won't be buying again until they put quality materials in this product that leaves my hair moisturized with a long-lasting fragrance.,0
love this scent,1
"This product is very hard to find at my location and, the price was excellent. I'll be back see you again",1
I can't say enough good things. My friend who has her own nail salon recommended this to me. My nails were brittle and breaking etc and after just one day they are no longer tearing apart etc.,1
"Am a fan of Go Therapeutics, but this product made me breakout in cystic acne at 60 yrs of age!!",0
"Its nice an light,wish it went from hot to cool itself like my last dryer. great price.",0
"quality is ok, but the color is normal",1
This simply did not work. I used it as directed for two months and noticed no change at all. Pretty disappointing considering the high price.,0
"So I have to admit I had a little fun in the shower with this one. The product's formula allows it to perform a little trick, which is that the cleanser comes out clear, with the consistency similar to hair gel, then as you watch it slowly starts to foam and turn white. Rub your wet hands together and it turns fabulously soapy, more like shaving cream. In fact, you could use it for shaving cream in a pinch. The formula is so rich and creamy, the most lather I have had with a body wash. The product rinses cleanly, and I feel like my skin is a little more moisturized out of the shower. My personal preference is that a body wash smell delicious, the scent on this wasn't bad, just almost nonexistent. I also like that it comes in a hairspray-looking container. If you like a lot of lather with your body wash, and don't mind the muted scent, this one is a good choice.",1
this product is awesome it really made a huge difference but it's not working it doesn't suck anymore and when I called the company they wouldn't replace it or fix it because I bought it through Amazon and when I called Amazon they couldn't do anything about it because he was too late to replace it or return it,0
"Do not buy!!!
This product messed up my skin!!!
My skin is a lot worse that before I started using this product!!! Buyer beware!! This is a total waste of money!!",0
I ordered it for a friend and it was broken.,0
Awful consistency - make up does not go on smoothly with this product,0
it is ok.,0
"I've bought this aftershave for five years for my husband. I decided to order it through Amazon and received what is either a bad run from the manufacturer - OR - the product is counterfeit and since there is no bar code or product code on the bottle. The product is missing the scented smell I like so much (replaced by a slight petroleum stink) and it is greasy. Since he had some left in his previous bottle, my husband didn't try this one until after Amazon's return window. Is Amazon going to allow themselves to be an online conduit for counterfeit products and ""second"" run goods like eBay? I've also contacted Leirac to no avail.",0
Wonderful product. Makes a great gift!,1
"I have tried other clarifying shampoos , I really don't like it because it made my feel like it kind had fly ways after drying.
I am not happy with this product and do plan to reorder thie item again.",0
"I was very excited to use this product when I first picked it up a week ago.  The product description and staff recommendation at my salon got me pretty interested and I loved the scent.  I have extremely unruly, wavy, naturally copper-colored hair which I am attempting to grow out from a very short pixie cut (6 inches of craziness now, and counting).  The idea of a ""healing"" product seemed like a great idea, given that I have been prone to a bit of dryness lately and want my hair and scalp to be as healthy as possible to encourage strong growth.  Other features I liked about this shampoo included the fact that it is sulphate-free (sulphates and dandruff go hand in hand for me) and that it is not tested on animals.

Unfortunately, I was very quickly disappointed when I used the product - literally, as I shampooed, I could feel the texture of my hair changing from just everyday oily to feeling filthy dirty (like I dipped my head in silty water).  It was really gross.  I had this moment of ""oh no, not again!"" as this has happened to me with another sulphate-free product in the past (Everpure shampoo by L'Oreal).  The L'oreal product actually damaged my hair horribly, in addition to leaving a gross, waxy residue, so I was concerned the same was going to happen here.  Even so, I figured I'd give the L'anza product a fair chance since I'd already started the process, so I dutifully conditioned with the product from the same line and then went about my blowdrying routine.  I did find that my hair was more controllable when using this product, but this was because the weight of the build-up on my hair was so extreme.  It took forever to blowdry it too.  After it was finally dry, it felt a little better to the touch (though still rather dirty-feeling).  It also changed the color of my hair to a bit darker and duller-looking, which is not at all what I had in mind!

For the price of the product, I was very displeased with its performance.  I used it twice more, just in case, but the result was always the same, so I wound up returning it to the salon for a refund.  The good news is, when I washed with my old shampoo (Organix), all the build-up disappeared, leaving my hair in the same (albeit dry) condition as before I used the L'Anza products.  So, no harm done here, especially since L'Anza does have a great money-back guarantee!

I asked at the salon about my experience and was told that the lighter and finer your hair, the better ""smoothing"" products work.  For thicker, darker hair though, the build-up can be too intense.  I'll be keeping this in mind the next time I decide to purchase a higher-end product!",0
Good as usual!,1
Great product NEVER RECEIVED!!!!,0
"Love Toppik!! The results were above & beyond my expectations. My only issue would be about the bottle design. It is difficult to tell how much product is left. Perhaps a new bottle design should be considered where a clear slot runs along the length of the bottle from top to bottom so that how much product left behind is clearly visible. This would allow users to know when it is time to reorder. Otherwise, amazing product!!",1
"If you are a tobacco\leather\honey lover then you will love this.  This stuff is super powerful, honestly, more than one spray is too much.  This is well made and of high quality, just not my preference in Cologne.  If you like the strong, overpowering leathery\tobacco cologne with a touch of sweet honey then this is for you.  In fact, I have an almost full bottle if you want to buy it from me.

I blindly bought this from this guy on youtube that recommended it.  So it goes...",0
Leave a residue behind and need to wash more often,1
I loved this and it just broke this morning- so sad. It didn't last very long,0
I do not recommend this product. I used it for 3 months religiously applying it every night and zero difference. Waste of money.,0
Used it once. Product left white flakes all over my head when it dried.,0
"Beautiful brush, the price doesn't bother me if it works but for my thick, wavy hair, it just didn't work for blowdrying. I've had better luck with large barrel metal brushes - the barrel on this is too small and my hair just gets tangled in this thing. Had a terrible hair day after using this and sent it back.",0
"I've been using this product for ten years and it still works great. I have short hair so a 1 1/2 pumps for me is all I need for the entire day. It never flakes and gives a great wet shiny feel to it. I go through these every 2-3 months. My only issue is the price, for something I know I will regularly buy, I'm hoping to find another comparable product that performs just as good, contains just as much or more, all for a hopefully cheaper price.",1
"Nice, lightweight moisturizer for day or night.",1
Amazing. Especially for those women with natural (black) hair that need to oil their hair. Its better than almond oil etc. if only it could be cheaper?,1
i like this better than the tinted face sunscreen as this feel ligther and i can put enough amount without having to worry about the tint rubbing on my shirt as it comes clear,1
"I don't get it, this had such great reviews. It burns your hair. It creates weird shape to the curls. I'd prefer a barrel without a clip. I would much prefer to put in hot curlers from conair. Some people swear by this, i think it is too damaging.",0
gives the wash you need!,1
"I've been meaning to get this for a while and now that I have it I can say I really like it, love it even. The color is extremely gorgeous. It is exactly how it is in the bottle. The formula is thin, but is buildable. I recommend two to three coats. It also dries on its own really fast which I like. I would definitely recommend it.",1
"Like it. Just not sure if I prefer this or a beauty box for the same price but bigger samples. I might have to try this again in hopes to be more ""wowed"". I am a subscriber of various beauty boxes and love more make up products than skincare. This however did have an AMAZING hair product that I had never heard of before- and I will definitely be ordering a bottle of that because I love it that much.",1
Everything sample sized. Not that great.,0
I hadnt smelled this in years but remembered I liked it alot. It was shipped fast and came in its new box. I really love this smell and is one of a kind. It can be alittle overpowering so you only need alittle bit.  I love how it has a nice soft powdery but still sweet smell.,1
it was ok but did not last long  I had it for about 2 years when it died would not buy it again,0
Smells wonderful! This does a great job as a leave in conditioner. The shampoo I love doesn't have a conditioner so I bought this to use after shampooing. A little goes a long way!,1
If you aren't a master at doing hair then this is not for you.  I tried and tried and Nothing curled.  It came out as straight as it went in.,0
"I love a good exfoliating face wash, but I don't like using anything that contains plastic microbeads that get in the water system and poison sealife and eventually, humans.  This tube doesn't make it easy to figure out what the microbeads (the gritty exfoliating particles) are made of here, but I've combed through the ingredients and it seems like they are made of ""Diatomaceous earth"", which seem to be crushed and cooked algae shells.  So, this works for me.

The gel itself is kind of silvery-grey with little white specks.  It goes on smooth and I like using it for my face, but it doesn't really lather up enough to use as an all-over body scrub (unless you want the tube to last three days).  It doesn't have too much of a scent and it defintiely leaves me feeling clean and washes off easily with my face prepped for a good shave.

I got this tube for free for review, but looking at the product page it is a little shocking to see that it goes for $28 for 5 oz.  Face washes can be expensive, but that will give me pause before I buy another tube.  Too bad, it's good stuff.",1
One of the worst moisturizers I have used.  Pretty much any drugstore brand provides more moisture... I don't get the hype.  The only positive for me was the smell.  It is also too thin in my opinion.  Facial Fuel by Kiehls is a much better alternative.,0
"Both of my daughters have pretty severe acne all over their face, shoulders and back. This product did appear to decrease the redness and swelling in just a night however after several weeks has not appeared to decrease the amount of acne that they both have.  For a spot treatment however, it does make a noticeable difference in just one treatment.",1
I was really expecting to love this mascara since the eye liner is so wonderful. I really don't care for it. It felt very clumpy and difficult to apply cleanly.,0
"Does the job. I use some of the other Jack Black products, and especially like the electric pre-shave. Don't know if I'd use this every day though, as I'm afraid it would dry out my skin too much.",1
"My husband wanted an old fashion razor telling me they work better than the disposable multi blade options.  He was excited to get the razor; but, after using it once he was disappointed in it. First, he shaves in the shower so using it in constant wet conditions doesn't work well because the water makes the handle very slippery to hold. Second, the razor was hard to work with because the handle is so short. So after his first shave, my husband had cut marks all over his face and neck. Needless to say, the razor ended up in the garbage.",0
"I received a tube as a free gift with a beauty purchase. I ended up returning the original item, but the this was worth so much more! First and only one step lip product that has ever kept my lips moisturized and has helped to stop the cracking and splitting/bleeding. I've gone through every product and the minute I found this I ordered two more tubes.",1
"I bought this on half year ago from eBay seller, it's work perfectly. So I order it again from Amazon. When I receive it. I found it does not heat on 220V country(specification is 110-240V), just warm. I think I receive the defect item so I return it and order it again. But I found another one still have same problem. So I think the whole batch is same. It can't work on 220V properly.",0
The formulation isn't as thick as I've experience with other purple shampoos so it does not provide much moisture.,0
Great product.  It better be for $80.  Too bad their 20 cent aerosol pump broke.  All that expensive appearance to package what really is great product and they lost me as a future customer because of a simple dispensing device.  I love the product.  Highly recommend it if they could fix their pump.  I have a nearly full bottle sitting on my dresser.  Don't waste your money.,0
"Very good product for people like me with thin and fine hair.  Works as well as hairspray.  Gives body and makes it look like I have more hair, without making my hair too stiff.",1
"My wife says ""It's amazing"" definitely worth the price!",1
Good,1
Unfortunately this item was defective and I had to return it.  The on/off switch didn't work right.  It kept siwtching itself back and forth.  I am disappointed since the features looked promising.,0
"Super happy with this palette.

Every shade is perfect and suits my pale skin.

I loved it so much I purchased a backup.

Very handy to keep in you handbag for touch ups.",1
"love it, i feels just as described",1
Did not like at all,0
one of my favorite masks! It's soothing and cleansing.,1
"The Baxter of California Night Cream AHA is a thick, dense AHA formula. I personally love how thick it is because you have so much control over how much to squeeze from the tube. I rub it on my fingers and then onto my washed face.

In the mornings, after I wash it off, I can feel the small bumps on my face are smoother. It's probably a combination of the AHA (alpha hydroxy acids which help slough off the top/dead layer of skin.

The dimethicone and parabens aren't my dream ingredients. I wish it was more natural, however, many are not. At this point, I'm just glad it works.

And the price point? For what you get, $24 is a great deal.",1
"I bought this at my local Ulta while looking for a new makeup brush cleanser as I had run out of my Bare Escentuals one. I love this cleanser, it impressed me from the first use. I use a cleansing milk to wash my sensitive skin, but it doesn't get all the makeup off so I use a non electric makeup brush to cleanse my skin. It seemed no matter what I used my brush remained dingy looking from the residual makeup. Until this gem came along, that is. From the first time I used it I knew it was worth every cent. The cleanser gently foams up as I gently rub my brush around the soap block, and then I use my fingers to kind of scrub the cleanser in. This cleanser always rinses clean and leaves my brush nice and soft.
I knocked off a star because the smell is pretty strong, rather floral, and it can irritate my allergies at times. If they came out with an unscented cleanser would be perfect!",1
"This hair dryer is very lightweight, plus has all kinds of features and speeds. Well worth the money.",1
Great product!,1
"This cologne doesn't deserve as high of recommendation as have seen for it in consumer reviews.  That is the only reason that I bought it.  I have had much better.  Unfortunately, I can't recall the name.  That is why I bought this, instead.  It goes to show that you cannot rely on consumer reviews, when buying cologne.  There is no substitute for trying before buying.",0
"Did not seem like it was blowing air at all.  The center part heats up like a curling iron & then it has the stiff bristles attached.  Did not grab & ""tug"" on my hair like a real brush would.  Felt flimsy.  Hair was still frizzy.  Not good for wet or damp hair.",0
Excellent volume shampoo.,1
Luv it heats up very well,1
Love this stuff. So fresh.,1
I wanted to love this brand because the product is amazing. Dissapointed with the shipment quality. I read other reviews and I should have listened to them. I got the conditioner with a broken cap (picture attached) and I also bought the shampoo which was significantly empty. The oz might be accurate but the bottle should be appropriately built then. Not worth it if for the price of the product unfortunately.,0
The color in the picture was not true to what I received-I was anticipating more of a pink hint to the product from the picture. No problems with delivery of the product.,0
The on/off button is right on the handle and easily turns off while you're using it---not a great user design. Would not recommend this straightener.,0
I have been wet shaving with de blade for over 55 years. I thought I would treat myself to the new and much more expensive world of Merkur.  I have used many different razors.  But mostly my original butterfly Gillette.  It is adjustable and has never broken.  Now I have a new Merkur which has to be handled carefully otherwise it comes apart.  The shave isn't as good as Gillette and the adjustment is not real.  Also the head is much thicker and difficult to handle in tight spots.  Changing the blade is not as safe as old Gillette.  I am glade I didn't throw out the old for new.,0
"I bought this hot air brush to use on my synthetic hair wigs, as it does not get hot enough to damage the fibers. Can also be used on my own hair. A wig company was selling these (that look identical) at a higher price, so this is a good value.",1
nothing like the product ive purchased in past from salon. odor and does not do the job its supposed to,0
"I love this product!! Have tried many mascara....none compare. I have very sensitive eyes, Blinc doesn't bother them at all. Love it!!",1
"i'm disappointed. I have thick, wavy hair. I bought both this and the Paul Mitchell skinny serum to help try to make my hair a bit more manageable. The paul mitchell skinny serum seems to do a much better job at that, the Rusk one here doesn't seem to have much, if any effect on my hair.",0
"I believe this is a counterfeit product. The bottle is a different color than before and the wording on the label is different than what I buy in salons. It used to say Made in USA; Now it says Made in USA of US or imported ingredients.  The original product is in the middle in the picture, it is the lighter colored bottle. In fact, the bottle pictured is not the one I received. The bottle I received has the wording facing the other direction (see picture).",0
"Love this shave cream, it lathers up like crazy with thick, rich lather with a little bit smaller than a dime in your bowl or on your brush with just a little water.  The scent is refreshing and bracing and has a little tingle to it.",1
Too overpriced :-( compare somewhere else,0
"I was happy to get the LAURA BIAGIOTTI ROMA UOMO DEODORANT STICK and try it out.  It has been several days now and It is working fine.  The fragrance is pleasant and manly, and holds up all day.  The stick functions as it should and is solid enough.  I like it, BUT and there is a big BUT, the price.  Is it better than my other deodorants?  And my others are a fraction of the price.  I like this stick but making it my regular deodorant is doubtful.",1
good moisturizer for everyday dry skin.,1
"Wow, this didn't last long at all. Half a dozen uses at most before it was gone. Will not repurchase.",0
Great irons very hot! Customer service from this company is very helpful - good prices,1
Great product. Im a very thankful and blessed farmer.,1
"My husband uses this razor, so this review is from his point of view:

After being introduced to safety razors recently, I purchased this for my wife, as I thought the longer handle would be more advantageous when shaving harder to reach places than the shorter-handled one she purchased for me for Christmas.  She ended up liking that one more than this one, and I ended up liking this one instead of the other one (I also reviewed that safety razor and gave it 5 starts, however).

This handle holds the razor at a less-aggressive angle, and reminds me of an older Gillette Sensor2 in the feel and blade angle.  It has three posts to hold the razor blade in place, and the backplate bends the razor down to keep it firm when you're shaving.  Comes apart very easily as well, and after a quick swipe with a towel it's as shiny as when you took it out of the box.  I take mine fully apart to let it dry before I put it back together to prevent rust or weird build-up, and within about 15 minutes it's dry.

I feel like I can shave my face less carefully with this razor (compared to even cartridge razors like the Gillette Fusion) and it still doesn't nick or cut me.  Once you get the angle right, whatever blade you prefer will mow down days' worth of growth like it's not even there.  I make two passes, one with the grain straight down, and then another cleanup pass cross-grain towards my mouth.  Upper lip and chin get a third pass cross-grain the other way.  After I finish, 90% of my face feels like it did before I could grow a beard, with no irritation to speak of.  As of this writing, this razor has 4,260 5-Star reviews, and it deserves every one of them.  It's $20, and you'll never want to shave with anything else ever again.",1
"Love this product to add shine & control. Just use a teeny, tiny bit. That's all that's needed.",1
"I have owned this iron for 2.5 months and it has stopped working. I turn it on, it gets hot, then shuts off. I can't keep it hot and therefore cannot use it! And it seems that the warranty won't apply because I bought this through Amazon instead of a hair salon!!

This should last more than 2.5 months. DO NOT BUY! PRODUCT IS DEFFECTIVE!",0
"I love the dryer, but it took a few times to get used to the heat it produces.  I have a feeling the product was used once before because the packaging inside was missing.  the first time I used it a hole formed in the attachment to direct the air.  Since then however the dryer has worked well.",1
"This is my second attempt to try something from this brand because I do love their packaging. Unfortunately I think the products are not for me. This particular eye shadow had zero staying power although it applies nicely and looks really cute when you put it on. It is a very nice shimmery champagne color that is sort of nude on med skin tone (like mine). The first time I used it it creased like crazy and it felt like my eyelid was sort of greasy, but I thought that maybe it was because I had worked out. The second time I wore it to school (did use primer) and by lunch it had already creased into a thick line so I had to wipe it off. I use other shimmery shades and haven't experienced the same problem, in spite of having a little bit of a hooded eyelid.",0
The flat iron is no longer heating for more than 30 seconds and I can no longer return it?  It was purchased in April of 2016...would expect MUCH more of a flat iron of this cost.,0
"Loved it!!!!!! My hair is very dry, bleached and on humid days frizzy......I first used it down the Jersey Shore.....kept the frizz down !!!!!!!!",1
"To all users, please be aware that this prodect worth nothing .i was using monixidal 15% and i got acceptable results,
at least maintaining the existing hair , but since i decided to use hairmax Laercomb (which was the worst decision i've made for this year) i lost almost more than half of the existing hair within 3 months, it was really sad results for me. people kept saying you are loosing your hair so fast. all this happened just after starting using Hairmax Lasercomb .
i recomend not to use this product at all, it is just a waste of money and time .",0
It builds an excellent lather but I'm find the lime scent disappointingly mild. It's a good quality product but not to my taste.,1
I had one single huge cystic pimple on my chin that i was battling for atleast three months. I order this and by day three it was much smaller and after a week it was gone!,1
Made my skin break out worse than before :(,0
"This mitt is definitely a must-have for the application of self-tanning products.  I used mine with the St. Tropez Self Tanning Mousse, and thank goodness I did.  This mitt made for an amazing application, it was effortless and it really made my tan 100% streak-free and the color blended perfectly.  The only reason I didn't give this a perfect 5 star review is because the product did seep through onto my right thumb during the process, which only happened because the top side of the mitt is a thin nylon material and when you're spreading the tanning product on sometimes you forget to be careful (I'm always in a hurry) and if the mitt starts to slide the product can easily seep through the back side.  Maybe in the future they could make the mitts with a fitted piece inside to prevent the sliding, but that's my only minor issue- I still love my mitt and recommend it to everyone who uses a self tanner!",1
Just started to use it. I use YT videos to see how it should be done. will have to update after a few months.,1
Good at hiding blemishes without looking like wearing makeup. Part of grooming regimen every morning. Skin looks healthier. Blends well when using brush.,1
"It broke last week, it barely lasted 4 months.  It wasn't dropped or abused.  I treated it kindly because it was expensive and I really liked how it operated.  Very disappointed.",0
Not for me,0
"Great product! I would buy again. I really liked the ""that's incredi-peel"". I could tell a difference in the fine lines on my face and felt my skin was firmer overall. This product did make face red and dry. I tend to be more sensitive than the average person, so I just used the peels once a week. I still feel like I got a great result and spacing the use out really helped my sensitive skin. I would give the peels 5 stars. The other included products worked as advertised, but didn't feel like anything special to me.",1
The flat iron doesn't align properly!  The plates meet at one end and have a large opening on the other end. Therefore it does not straighten my hair equally. I am extremely disappointed to pay top dollar for a top of the line flat iton that has such a fault.  Amazon denied my return because it's out of 30 day window. Return policies should be extended for defective merchandise. I would like a refund.,0
"I absolutely love this product. This is by far the best eye liner I have ever used. It stays on all day, it would stay on forever if you wanted. Doesn't smear or flake off or run down your face. I use it on my water line and makes my eyes look huge and glamorous. I feel like a model when I  walk out of the house wearing my fabulous eye liner.",1
"I stayed at a really nice 5 star hotel in LA with work and this product along with Cilantro Conditioner were in the bathroom.
I guess I am a guy who likes to be well kept and likes good quality product but every so often you come across one which just feels different and nice.
These products feel great, smell great and have a really nice refreshing feeling.

My wife is super sensitive to smells and ingredients in products but also has used them and has no problem.
More over she always comments when I sue the product that it smells like I just came out of a high quality barbers.",1
Love this color polish! Shipped fast and paints on great. True to color in picture. Not a minty green or grassy green. More of a dull green but it's exactly what I wanted and I love it.,1
Works great to give you hair texture and volume.,1
Great!,1
Have been using this for a couple of weeks now with no improvement maybe try a little longer,0
Great travel set. Good varietyof color options.  Works with different color of clothes options. Would be a great gift  I would like to see other color options.  (Like smokey eyes or blush lips palette.,1

"Received the box today and immediately I could tell the quality is subpar. Sitting right-side-up on my desk, one corner is lifted off the surface of the desk while the other sits flush to the desk - this thing is lobsided! Inside, you can see edges of the material (that they glued?) covering the actual trays. The trays are black but have brown spots showing near the edges where the material underneath is already showing.
There is a dent in the handle and the material (leather? pleather?) is semi-ripped from sitting against the latch.",0
"Nice starter kit.  It will allow you to try the products and see if you are allergic to anything.  I have fairly sensitive skin, and I still use the Cleansing gel (scrubbed in with a wash cloth) on a daily basis (sometimes I need to use it twice to get off heavy SPF lotions).  I still use the Green Apple Peel when I would like a deep clean, once or twice a month.  I also still use the Blemish clearing serum (larger size comes in a glass bottle with an eye dropper) for small breakouts (really works well.",1
I feel like a baby seal before I go clubbing my skin is so soft. Dancing- I don't club baby seals. If you don't get this I suspect that you do because you are afraid of feeling how they feel...baby-silky-smoooooth.,1
"I absolutely love the Laura Geller New York Spackle Mattifying Oil Control Under Make-up Primer. I love it so much, in fact, that I didn't delve into researching how toxic the chemicals are in the product! I've been wearing another, more expensive department store, primer and this one beats it out on every level.

Application is not only simple, but the product feels weightless and luxuriously creamy on the face. Make-up application is, indeed, flawless, and my skin looks even toned and smooth. It so effectively mattifies my face that I don't even get my typical midday shine. I highly recommend the Laura Geller New York Spackle Mattifying Oil Control Under Make-up Primer.",1
This is my 4th time purchasing this exact same product and color. Its a beautiful dark brown that stays on all day and easy to make a smokey eye. The recent one I got is less easier to blend than the others I have gotten. But I'll just assumed it's a fluke and buy the same thing again when I run out.,1
This product is great works really well......I have bought it a few time....it also darkens/fills in you eyebrows....love it,1
fabulous,1
"I use OPI exclusively as I'm never disappointed.  I actually prefer their topcoat that has a pink cast, as it's less apt to yellow in the sunlight.",1
"Just as the store, But cheaper!!",1
Great shampoo,1
I think that this is not nearly as good as some drug store brand mascara.,0
It is too thick for me to spread over my face evenly.  The color is a little too dark and it shows if a spot is skipped which can happen easily because of being hard to spread.,0
"I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars for this review.

After reconsidering back and forth, 2 stars is the way our personal assessment of this mens Eau de Toilette goes.  We didn't like it and would not purchase it.  This fragrance was for our review for the Amazon Vine Program.

As a woman, I have enjoyed and repeated purchase of Burberry Brit for women. Every time I wear this fragrance, I am sure to get compliments.

Anticipating the same for the Burberry for men, we were excited to try this Eau De Toilette.

Our impressions:
When first spritzed it has a nice fragrancelightly assertive and crisp.  However, this scent faded quite quickly.  I kept inquiring if my husband had it on.

My husband then applied an extra spritz or two.  It again faded quickly.

I tried it myselfsame outcome.

It also seems to fade to a very light non-memorable scent.

From all I have read about personal scentsit is just that.

Chemistries are unique.  Hence, varying impressions ensue.

For us, not a winner, but for some others, it could be a wonderful.",0
I have tried the original and loved it. This one is strange. Soapy feel and very drying. Made me break out. Possibly not authentic?,0
"Somehow managed to make my hair both dry, and greasy. Which is a nightmare for curls.",0
"very expensive lotion, for 20$ not worth it at all",0
No way for professional. Air doesnt get hot enough and the nazzle is too narrow. I tried this one a month but still no way. Disappointed,0
"I really like this product -- the blue algae makes you feel like you're at the spa.  My only gripe is the price of the product.  I ask for this on my gift lists, but if I'm buying something myself, I'll settle for a cheaper product.",1
This is the best Body Lotion I have ever tried. I love it. It sells good andmakes my skin feel wonderful. I recently ran out and tried using other brands but I eventually had to place another order for this product. I will keep a supply from now on.,1
Nice dark coverage but clumps easily.,0
Works great!,1
"Absolutely fantastic nail polish. Great shine, beautiful texture. Lasts longer with base and too coat. Only took a star off because of the price tag. Ill stick with OPI.",1

* It has SPF of 25.  I find products with 15 SPF don't provide enough protection.  The sunscreen ingredients:  homosalate (6%), octisalate (5%), octocrylene (7%) and titanium dioxide (3.75%).

* It is tinted, so it makes my skin look smooth and polished.

A big negative for me though was the strong scent of this product.  It is strong and it is very artificial.  I found it quite unpleasant after a while, especially since its on my face and close to my nose.  I gave up using this product because of that.  It is funny how scent is so personal.  Other reviewers remarked on the very light scent.  I am not usually so sensitive to scents, but this scent was very unpleasant for me.",0
Did not buy this,1
"I have tried every skin moisturizing product available within my budget which tops out at about $100.00. I have used the cheaper ones, Olay, Neutrogena, etc. spending lots of money in lesser amounts but creating nothing but a lot of purchases for probably a lot more money.

In the long run I believe Strivectin is the best buy and has the best results for the money. My skin is soft and supple and does look somewhat younger than my actual age. It also take a lot LESS product and lasts forever.

If you are younger I believe the results would be even more remarkable.",1
I must have gotten a bad batch.,0
"There are features to this product that I can't test--it's supposed to be a moisturizer, sun protection, and firming creme. The last two are a bit difficult to objectively test.

That being said, aside from trying it on my face, I've been using it where I needed it most, as a moisturizer on my hands, and it definitely works for that, and a little bit goes a long way. This time of year my hands get incredibly dry and chapped. Using this has helped an incredible amount, so as a moisturizer this product is top notch. It goes on smoothly and is not sticky after being applied.

I'm the type of person who isn't a fan of scents. I'd rather a product just smelled of its components rather than containing added ingredients in the form of perfumes. So I'm not a fan of the scent (hence the docked star), which is very strong and lingers. This is one reason I decided it would not be a face product for me, because the scent is especially strong when the product is near the nose. But it definitely does its job as a moisturizer.",1
Not only does this exfoliate your face but it has the mango and makes it feel so soft!,1
"Good stuff, I love Burberry Sport and so does she",1
"I don't like heavy stuff on my skin, thought this one would be summer spray, but sometimes my skin still dry out, so for now I'm using this one with facial cream. I like the way how water sprays out, good product!",1
"I love this product, however if you have sensitive skin, you may not want ""full strength"".",1
"No  disappointed  in  product, does  not  work",0
"Wonderful product -- as all Borghese products are!!  Feels like silk when applied and the signature ""scent"" of Borghese is comforting, exhilarating and proof that you're pampering yourself with the very best.  It doesn't get any better than this!!!",1
It was not the correct color at all!!!! So disappointing!!,0
Good color!,1
One of the straws inside the bottle is broken so the pump doesnt work.,0
"I live in Florida where the humidity is really bad. I have often found that my makeup basically comes off from the heat and humidity and cannot seem to find anything that will stay in place during the day. I have to say that this product was wonderful. It is easy to apply and feels light which is a big plus. I don not like when makeup feels caked on. The only thing I did not like about the product is that it comes with an applicator, which is basically a large powder puff. After you apply the powder you place it back on top of the powder. It is separated by a plastic sieve for the better part of the word. So when you want to reapply again the powder puff will have excess powder left over from your first application. Having to dusk off the excess you would be wasting powder. So my advice to Dermablend would be to have a switch inside to close the sieve when you place the powder back in.",1
love it,1
"I don't know how other mascaras can even compete with this product. The applicator is amazing and gives you a non-clumpy look (praise) and the mascara stays on forever. Because of it's formula this product will never crumble and give you that end of the day black eye, you know what i'm talking about. I have been using this product on my lashes exclusively for over three years and I don't plan on EVER using anything else. This is also great for sensitive eyes. (side note: I have naturally long lashes, I have been told this product works better with this lash type but I'd still recommend giving it a try wish shorter lashes)",1
"I tried this product, it's pretty good, makes my hair real smooth. The only concern I have is that the product came not sealed in any way...how can I know that it's the real thing?",1
reveived damaged product.,0
Happy with this razor. Wish I would have purchased a heavier razor.,1
I purchased this item and it doesn't really hold up to all that it says it will do.  I still have stubble and quite honestly I don't think it's all that it is made out to be.  I wouldn't suggest anybody purchasing this item.  I am in the process of returning it and am afraid I am going to lose out on my return.  I purchased it on 12/20/12 and have asked the dealer whom I purchased it from for a return form.  We will see what happens.  But truly I don't believe ths product is all that great!,0
"I've tried so many polishes and top coats, but this one lasts longer than any of them.  And I'm talking about OPI and Nicole, etc., not just the cheap brands.  I really get 5-6 days out of this polish without chipping.  I definitely think it is worth trying if you are unhappy with your nail polish!",1

Ive used this product. For over a week everyday and had zero results very disappointed don't buy not worth the money,0
"I've only used this product twice, but honestly I feel like that's long enough to give a review. What made me buy this soap was that it was supposed to be long-lasting, supposed to be great on your skin, and supposed to smell good (which is why I purchased the verbena scent). I originally wanted the ""milk"" scent because that is what was suggested to me, however I couldn't find a single solid review on its scent. Surely it doesn't smell like ""milk."" A lot of people said they liked the scent, but didn't describe it at all - except one person, who said it reminded them of baby powder... so I immediately changed my mind and went with verbena. The other option was lavender, but I hate lavender so that wasn't an option for me. Now a lot of people described verbena as citrus. Personally, I would take a step further and say it smells exactly like lemongrass, or just lemon in general. When I think of citrus, I think more orangey than lemony (this might just be a personal thing), so if you're wanting an exact description of the scent, lemongrass is it. It's a nice scent, but I am slightly disappointed. I think my expectations were just too high. As far as the feeling goes, I definitely agree with everyone else's reviews. Makes your skin feel great. It lathers up really well, doesn't strip your skin, but leaves you feeling clean without that residue feeling a lot of soaps give you. And while I don't find the soap to be particularly moisturizing, it is definitely not drying my skin either. Most soaps dry my skin out, so the fact that this at least doesn't do that makes me happy. I have zero complaints about the soap's actual intended purpose. As far as longevity goes, I'll try and update this in the future - but I can see this lasting quite a while. It is almost 9oz of soap. Your average bar of soap (for example, let's go with Dove) is around 4oz I believe. So it's about twice as big as a regular bar of soap. I can understand why people find the size daunting. To me, it doesn't bother me. I like the size, and of course the more you use it, the easier it'll be to grab. It is definitely a solid bar of soap, too, so you can tell it will last a long time. Whereas with, again, for example, Dove, it feels very soft, and it wears down quickly. When you take all that into consideration, this soap isn't really as expensive as it initially seems. Any added price after taking longevity into consideration (if any added price at all), can be justified by the quality of the soap. I do have a recommendation, and I may actually consider doing this myself, is cutting the soap in half. It would probably make it easier to hold/use, and make you feel like you're getting more for your money. I'm guessing a knife would be the best way, however I have no idea how difficult that would be. Might be pretty difficult considering how solid the soap is. The only reason I'm not giving this soap 5 stars, is because like the star description says, I just don't love it. I like it. Definitely one of the best bar soaps I've used. But I'm not blown out of the water. I do however think you get your money's worth, and that's reason enough to go out and try this soap. If you're like me and were searching for something better than your everyday grocery store soap brands, I recommend this. I've used brands like Lush in the past and, while I did like their soap, I hate that their soaps are in awkward shapes. I want something shaped like a bar of soap, not a square piece of soap.",1
"The kiddy orange color and smell are show stoppers for me. Product performance isn't bad, but I can't abide by the color and smell. Prefer Admiral, or Reuzel.",0
I like this product and think it does help.,1
Love this product!  Smells amazing and makes my hair so soft.  I just lightly spray it on my ends when my hair is damp.  My hair is hi lighted very blonde and my ends looks so healthy.,1
"Just started using it as and it works, I can already tell this bottle will last me a very long time. *It does blister sensitive skin though, not to be used too often",1
"It's shampoo.  Used it for 3 months, there's nothing special about this that warrants the price.",0
Like it!,1
"Distinctive clear, clean, and crisp with nice subtle overtones. I like it too!!!! Any man would enjoy this clean but straight-forward scent (casual or dress settings included).",1
Wife love it,1
"I have been trying to find a dry shampoo that actually works since I was like 12 years old. I cannot stand dirty sweaty/greasy/scalp/hair. Most of the ones I tried either do pretty much nothing or smell so strong they give me a headache. And really do not work. This product is very expensive in my opinion for the tiny amount you get but a little goes a long way, it has a delicate clean tropical coconut smell that does not bother my allergies & gives volume and works beautifully. I really cannot believe it. I am also sensitive to chemicals and have an autoimmune disease and so far-after using a week or so no reactions. My stylist could not believe I had not washed my hair in three days when I went in to have my color done yesterday. It is very hot and sweaty a great time of the year where I live. And my hair tends to get limp and greasy really quick despite using hormone free natural shampoos and all that stuff. The only way I could stand it most of the time was to wash it daily in our warmest weather especially on mornings I walk my dog a few miles giving me no choice. But this has been a game changer. It gave me instant volume, clean fresh but not strong muted scent and my hair was revised and easy to style. By not having to wash it every day my color will also stay preserved and my hair healthier. I will update if anything changes. I highly recommend trying it out HOWEVER keep in mind all hair types are different. Mine is relatively thick, color treated and light brunette if that helps. It may not work the same on all hair types and remember everyone's chemistry and sensitivities vary. My only complaint? I wish it was not called Death Valley lol but perhaps that is because that is a hot, sweaty place and this works on such conditions.",1
"This is one of my most favorite perfumes. It smells GREAT, is affordable and comes in a generous portion. I was so happy to see it's still being made after all these years.",1
"I've been purchasing this face wash for about 6 months, works great on acne, specially on oily skin. The aloe makes it feel refreshing and it really reduces pimple without over drying it.. Since I started using it I barely get breakouts.",1

My husband loves this shave soap. He said it is super smooth and seems like it will last awhile. It is a great value too.,1
"Great for sensitive, combination skin. Skin feels very soft. Lasts a long time. Worth the cost. Use it every day.",1
"somewhat heavy / waxy texture feeling, so ended up applying it very thinly. very translucent, but overall not bad. it evens out the texture, in my view, by about 50%. not a miracle cream, but if only minor correction is needed, it will do the job.",1
Great my hands feel so soft and silky. Its a little greasy but it isn't like other lotions that leave residue or stickiness.,1
buena excelente,1
"It is exactly what it says it is, extra firm hold if that's what you're looking for. I use it to supplement gel, helps to fix things in place when it might fall apart a bit if the gel isn't quite dry. Not a fine mist, it is a hand pump spray bottle and can lay down a lot of product in short order without filling your bathroom with sticky fog.",1
It looks white on my face.  I have light tan complexion.  It doesn't spread well.,0
"I was a little nervous about using this on my face, so I prepared myself by watching the instructional DVD twice and reading all of the enclosed material. The DVD is very reassuring, and very misleading. They make it sound like you just need a little practice at the lowest setting and all will be well. Not true.

Right out of the box, my unit functioned poorly with the fine tip attached. I started trying to use it on my forehead just like on the DVD. They must have turned the unit off for those DVD demonstrations. You cannot slide the tip smoothly across your face like that. If you have adequate suction, as soon as you start to move across your skin, the tip pops off your face. With my unit, suction was sporadic and mostly nonexistent with the fine tip attached.

I switched to the precision tip, which gave me more reliable suction, but I still couldn't use it as instructed, because it HURTS. I was not pressing hard, but it was like pushing sandpaper tightly against your face and then dragging it across the skin. I don't have particularly sensitive skin, but this was so harsh that I decided to check some reviews before possibly damaging my skin. I'm glad I did. I won't be using this unit on my face again. One reviewer mentioned that people have been injured by this product, and she herself was under a doctor's care to heal the damage it did to her skin.

On the DVD they say your face will have some redness for about 30 minutes after a treatment. Once again, untrue. Many hours after use, there were still red patches on my face, and my forehead and nose had a burning sensation.

I thought maybe I could at least get some benefit from the machine by using it on the dry and calloused places on my feet. For that I used the coarse tip and a higher suction level. It was a complete waste of time. The only place you can get suction is on the bottoms of your feet. No edges or contours, because you have to the the entire tip flat against your skin to get suction. I have big calluses on the outer edges of my big toes, and there was no way I could get the tip flat enough to get any suction in that area.

I cannot recommend this product, and I suggest you read a large number of reviews carefully before making your purchase decision. I'll stick with more gentle forms of exfoliation, and accept my fate of being old and ugly.",0
Has a great smell and loved the packaging but made my hair very clumpy.  My hair is pretty thin so it might work better for people with thicker hair.,0
"Some background on the company and product. ""StriVectin"" - what a gorgeous, meaningless name for which some marketing company was no doubt paid a lot!! - claims this is a high tech anti-wrinkle, anti-stretch mark cream which is more effective than Botox or retinol. OK, but those two have been thoroughly studied in the medical literature and both require prescriptions in their most effective forms. The active ingredient here, called NIA-114 or nicotinic acid, is derived from niacin, one of the B vitamins. ""StriVectin"" came out with this claiming it was better than Botox, and no prescription. Really? Let's face it folks, manufacturer claims have been known to be a teeny weeny bit exaggerated on occasion. Is there any actual  .. you know, EVIDENCE for this stuff? Given that it sells for, ah, $4,133 per liter or $15,622 per gallon? Niacin by the way is not expensive at all .. pennies per oz.

The backstory of how this kind of product is marketed was detailed in a New York Times article ""Debating the Claims Behind Wrinkle Creams,"" published Aug. 18, 2010 and available online by Googling. At the time of that article some years ago, the makers said they planned to submit data to peer reviewed medical journals. Whoops, guess not - because there is no sign of any such publication on their website today. The other ""proven results"" pointed to on the website are just testimonials from bloggers and other 'authorities' easily bought and paid for by a deep pocket cosmetics company. And you might want to know that ""StriVectin"" has received at least one cease-and-desist letter from the FDA over those claims that the product is better than Botox. Because, um, it isn't. And there is currently a class action lawsuit in the New Jersey courts that the marketing claims for ""StriVectin"" are false and misleading.

Cosmetics consumers rarely demand proof before they buy, and not be so taken in by slick packaging, clever marketing, and celebrity endorsements. There are few sources of independent testing for cosmetics. Consumer Reports did a wrinkle cream comparison a few years ago and found that NONE of the over-the-counter products were very effective or consistent. Of the 9 they tested, ""StriVectin"" (I just love that word! Have to keep saying it over and over!) was ranked 7 out of 9 among a weak field of results but 2 out of 9 in cost. Their slogan should be ""Less effective, costs more.""

My girlfriend has tried this a couple of weeks and says: nothing happened. In my opinion this is a straightup scam. If you want to try another product containing skin-friendly niacin, something called CeraVe is available for only $132 per liter. And if you want to know what dermatologists actually recommend to avoid wrinkles? At least those dermatologists whose morals have not been twisted into a pathetic little knot by lucrative consulting contracts with the StriVectins of the world? They say you need to 1) stop smoking and 2) stay out of the sun.",0
I love this product for flat ironing.  It works great and does protect and makes your hair really shiny.  You have to be very careful not to apply too much of this product and stay away from your roots or else it will make your hair look greasy.  A little goes a long way with this spray.,1
After using for a month am realizing the product is leaving a buildup in may hair. It doesnt rinse out well after shampooing causing a greasy feel after my hair dries. Wont buy again!,0
"First what all all the chemicals in this stuff, I was just shopping and figured most higher end brands don't add all that unnecessary stuff saw the main ingredients and figured it was good to go. This stuff is toxic and cheap. The scent was like something from the dollar store and the qauilty was just bad. For this price it makes no sense.",0
Buyer beware! I only had this item for just passed a year and only used it for about eight weeks and it stopped charging. The company sent me a new charger but that didn't address the problem. I was then Told too bad we're not replacing it. Do not buy this and less you're willing to spend $500 on something that barely lasts a year,0
Did not work at all for me. Made my hair really greasy after shampooing twice. Didnt make a difference in hair or scalp if anything it made my scalp feel worse.,0

It pinched. It hurt. It missed lashes. I threw it right in the trash. Too much trouble to return it. Ohhhh how I miss my old Shu Uemura curler. Too bad they don't make them anymore (at least not the same as the old ones). The search goes on...,0

"My hair is short to medium length and I use about a tsp. Combined with the Klorane brightening shampoo, this is perfect for keeping my silver hair bright and removing any dullness.",1
"I purchased this mascara in dark brown from my local Beauty supply store.  This Mascara won't smudge, while virtually every other mascara I've tried tends to smudge after 4 - 5 hours.  It is a simple mascara that darkens your lashes, adds limited length and volume.  I've tried both the black and dark brown when it was called ""Kiss Me"" by Blinc and several months ago purchased another Dark brown labeled only as ""Blinc"".  None have been flaky nor dry.  I wonder if the other posts that complained their product was flaky or dry had  either old or defective product.  Most sellers will replace a defective product.  The blincinc.com web site states it will exchange any defective product, but I don't know if that applies to product from third party sellers.  It washes off easily with water, which is curious because it stays on perfectly all day even the times my eyes watered a bit for some other reason.  When my eyes watered, I was careful to blot the tears away and my mascara remained undisturbed.  I now use it to coat other mascaras that add length (Lancome's Hypnose Star waterproof) or length and volume (Lancome's Grandiose).  I apply the Blinc carefully and lightly after the Lancome mascara has dried on my lashes so I don't remove the underlying mascara.  This way I can get the length or length and volume I want with the Lancome and the Blinc mascara keeps everything from smudging.  One down side is that any other liquids including eye drops and sweat can make the Blinc mascara come off in clumps.  The mascara takes a minute or two to dry.  I shorten the drying time to 20 - 30 seconds with the low cool setting of my hair dryer angled enough away from my face to create a light breeze by my lashes. Removal of the combined mascasras requires a two step process.  The Blinc is easily removed with water but resists oil based make-up removers, while the Lancome resists water and requires an oil based make-up remover for removal.  The Blinc product does come off in fibrous clumps when removing but other than looking weird it is not an issue.  I can get a bit more volume with any brand of mascara by using Lancome's Cils Booster XL as a base.",1

I have been using Mizani Therma Strength for a long time and I love it. I usually buy it local but the price on Amazon was about 10.00 less so I decided to purchase it through Amazon. Well the reason why it's 10.00 less is because this is a fake knock off! The picture of the product shown online here is not what you will get. I compared my current bottle to the one I received and there were definitely discrepancies. What a let down. Sold by NewvoBeauty and Fulfilled by Amazon.,0
My hair is thinning in spots and this does a fantastic job of covering it up. So glad I ran across it. It stays until you wash it out too.,1

"Love the product...until Image changed the packaging. I've had 3 tubes of the new pump dispenser and two of them didn't work. Instead of the serum dispensing out of the top, it squeezes out the sides at the bottom of the pump. I'm not buying it again until they change the dispenser. It wastes too much for the price!",0
"the sparkles are too big, it looks horrible.",0
"Both lotions smell very nice, not over powering and won't compete with your perfume if you wear one. I chose this because my skin is super sensitive and I figured if it's safe for a pregnant woman, it's safe for any woman, right? Plus, if it will plump up your breasts, why not your face? If it'll remove stretch marks, why not crows feet?

For the bust cream:
I can't say that I've noticed the differences advertised (no ""plumping"") and in checking the ingredients, this scores pretty low on the toxicity scale, which is nice. It's not greasy, feels great when you put it on and I do believe that moisturizer is going to help you feel better and helps keep your skin young looking.

Bust Firming Serum:

AQUA /WATER/ EAU, PEG-6, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, DEXTRIN, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, DIPHENYLSILOXY PHENYL TRIMETHICONE, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, PEG-40 HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, DIMETHICONE/PHENYL VINYL DIMETHICONE CROSSPOLYMER, PARFUM (FRAGRANCE), XANTHAN GUM, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, SODIUM HYDROXIDE, GLUCOSE, SOPHORA JAPONICA FRUIT EXTRACT, CENTELLA ASIATICA EXTRACT, SORBITOL, HYDROLYZED AVOCADO PROTEIN, MALTODEXTRIN, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, CITRIC ACID, LUPINUS ALBUS SEED EXTRACT, CI 47005 (YELLOW 10), CI 16035 (RED 40), TOCOPHEROL

This again is a nice smelling, non-greasy moisturizer. Will it prevent stretch marks? Well, stretch marks are genetic so I would be interested in learning about a lotion, potion or cream that could actually do that! But again, using moisture on skin that is stretching quickly will make it feel better and certainly can help with the awful itchiness that can start when the belly really starts to pop out there. So I would be cautious in believing this will fend off stretch marks - science just doesn't support that. But it's a nice lotion.

When I tried this, it looked too fake. I tried the liquid foundation alone with my Marutaki Rice Powder I got some time ago from the VT Country Store. Better, but still too shiny for my taste. I ended up sending it back.

Right now I've decided to wear (in this order) moisturizer, the Stila Beauty Balm, my Walmart liquid foundation topped with the powder version of the Illuminating Foundation. I top everything off with the Marutaki Rice Powder because it gives a nice matte finish. Sounds like a lot, but it works and looks really natural blended well.",0
Love everything about it. Totally recommend it.,1
"I have combination skin and some parts tend to be oily, this product totally dried my skin out which I normally don't mind, but I noticed it has some parts of my skin peeling. Also, the product clumps up so it's not good if you want to put make up on top of it. Honestly disappointed. Will be trying something else.",0

Now if I want to repair it, I have to send it in to Solano in Atlanta, Georgia..pay shipping to their repair shop and write a check for 30.00. Given how much it was used and what I paid for it, this isn't acceptable. Just not happy with the product.",0

Not good for waterline. Came right off .,0
LOVED IT,1
"This stuff leaves my hair feeling like straw. I'm not sure how that's even possible for something called a leave-in ""conditioner"", but it does. At first I thought I must be doing something wrong or something because it didn't make any sense, but then I realized that when I would wash it off of my hands after applying it to my hair, they'd feel dry and rubbery like I'd just used a bar of non-moisturizing soap. That's definitely not normal. Either this is a fraudulent product in a Ouidad bottle and isn't the real Ouidad product, or Ouidad has really dropped the ball. Do not recommend.",0

"I am fairly young and I was in constant search of a product that would hide my bald spots. I looked at Rogaine and trying vitamins like Biotin and such...but I wanted instant results. So I came across this product. My bald spots are located at the top of my head near the back. Maybe where the scalp ends. It's unsightly and it doesn't help that I have very thin hair, so I can't hide it by just moving hair around lol. Quite honestly, I don't want to end up leaving my hair in a bun for the rest of my life to hide my bald spot. I like variety. So, when I received this product, I was really excited and I applied it to the spot. It's extremely difficult when your bald spot is at the back of your head...obviously it's hard to apply something there when you can not see anything. But I went on, and used two mirrors to see what I was doing (one in front and one in back of me). It looked great from far away, I was still concerned with how it would look if people had to stand close by me. It looked great...really great from far away. I was ecstatic that it blended so well.

Here comes the problem. I noticed a few people that kept hovering behind me or looking in my direction oddly. I knew immediately that something must have looked bad enough to cause such attention. Mind you, no one mentioned anything to me. But I knew, when I got home and took photographs. Sure enough, the spotted pattern appeared (I included a customer photo above).

Okay so maybe you're saying to yourself, ""She should have bought the applicator!"" And you're right, maybe I should have. But honestly, I wish someone would have told me that without the applicator this would make you look like you were some sort of hybrid of human and animal. It would have saved a lot of embarrassment. I""m not going to diss this product entirely, because it worked and it looked somewhat natural in terms of color and blending. But the experience after using, over weighs the pros.

Here's another con: I must've spent 10 minutes applying that product and still the spotted pattern was still there. So that means, you're wasting product! You might not even get an even application after using the whole bottle (without the applicator). If you are still interested in this product, buy it with the applicator. I'm willing to try it, but honestly, I just want to hide under a rock until people forget this ever even happened.",0

"Ok, so I have purchased Lorac eyeshadow in the past and liked it well enough. This lipstick is complete crap. It's drying, chalky and really cakey. Get NYX matte lipstick. It's way cheaper and it's a little drying, but most matte lipsticks are.",0
Always does the job.  It's plastic so it always breaks after a period of time too.,1
"Not really a fan. This set is sheer and the colors are nice. What I do not like is that the polish does not adhere to my nails well. After a careful manicure and sealing with top coat, the polish raises around the nail edges when hands are in water for just basic daily hand washing, bathing. I wear gloves for kitchen cleanup so for me I found this polish pretty fragile....",0

The color doesn't go on smoothly and it chips just like a regular nail polish. Didn't hold even close to 7 days.,0
"This is the worst nail care system I've ever used! I followed every step to the letter. By the next day, most of the polish had chipped. I hadn't done any house work or gardening. The Zoya polish is pretty, and I did like the base coat,  but Cutex and Sally Hansen make better remover and top coat, and are far less expensive. A Sally Hansen top coat makes my manicure last for almost a week. There's a lesson here - more expensive, and more ""trendy"" doesn't make it better.",0
"The color has separated, so it isn't all one color green. My advice: don't buy nail polish online. Buy it in stores.  This nailpolish seems old.",0
"...other than deliver revenue to its manufacturer. At the current retail price, a pound of Nia's ""neck sculpting complex"" costs a cool $1100 dollars.

Here's my experience: this goes on easily enough, doesn't have a cloying odor and isn't greasy after application.

However, a month of use didn't result any appreciable difference in the ""contour"" of neck and jawline...either over time or immediately.

"Since switching to DE shaving I have found this product to be one of my favorites. I love the way this feels on my face, the menthol tingles but is not overpowering and it leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. Unlike other soaps/creams that I have tried, there is no oily residue left on my face after I finish shaving. Proraso lathers easily and the tub has a nice shape and size that makes it possible to lather in the tub; personally, I use a shaving bowl. I have seen some negative reviews for this product that claim it is difficult to build a lather with this soap; I can only speculate that these people do not know how to properly load their brush or add water to get the lather to the right consistency. This is shaving soap, not cream. There is a cream version of this product that comes in a tube and probably requires less water to lather. At any rate, I find those claims unsubstantiated. This shaving soap provides excellent protection against nicks and gives the right amount of lubrication so that the razor glides easily over my face. So many things about shaving are subjective and dependent on skin-type and beard-type so this may not be true for everyone, but for me this shaving soap provides good protection and does not dry out my skin. An added bonus is that Proraso is inexpensive compared with other brands of soaps I have tried. I have three other soaps that I use regularly, but I do not enjoy any of them quite as much as this one.",1

It is  much cheaper in  a two pack  here than at my stylist's.",1
"My heels had dried,cracked skin bad enough to bleed. 3 generous applications of this at night with socks and slippers on to hold the moisture and add heat, and they were back to normal.

"This is the first ""review"" I've ever done, for Amazon, and after buying hundreds of products, I HAD TO give 5 stars for this product. My cousin gave this to me, as a gift, and I haven't found anything BETTER!

This was not as purple as it looks here. If it were more cool toned gray I would have loved it too. This color is best on darker skin tones. It looked odd next to my fair skin.,0

I love this cologne!,1
"I have used Ahava products in the past, but this is my first time to use Night Treatment.  I picked out the product because the packaging indicates that it is intended for reduction of wrinkles and it helps firming the skin.  This product comes in 1 oz size and it is loaded with lots of amazing ingredients.  To name a few: horse chestnut, butcherbroom, sugar maple, orange, lemon, sugar cane, green bean, chamomile oil, calendula extract, olive oil, daisy flower extract and date.  Product also contains, vitamin A and E as well as various types of peptides.  I am used to Ahava brand using algae from dead sea along with dead sea water which is loaded with minerals.  This product also has aloe and mineral spring water.

Product really hydrates and firms skin but it also makes it soft.  It is ideal for night time use because all of these ingredients can be absorbs by the skin while you sleep.  One only needs to use a little but of it on the skin.  Product is absorbed quickly and it is not greasy.  I have combination oily skin, but this product can be used on any skin type.  Calendula helps every skin with any type of irritation.  However, fragrance is listed as one of the ingredients in case anyone is sensitive to fragrances.  I must say fragrance is very mild.  Ahava brand that can be found in any store, s product is easily accessible for purchase in drugstores as well as online.  Because of the size, this product will not take up much space in the bathroom.  I really enjoy this product and I would recommend it for anyone who is looking to moisturize skin, keep it calm and tight.",1
No scent. I think it's fake. Been using oribe for many years and this is a terrible product. Does nothing for my hair. Save your money and try a different vendor,0
"Bought this item in May 2016 and by August 4,2016 it fails to heat up.  It is worthless to me after less than six months and of course I cannot  return it. This is not a buy. Stay away.",0
"The short version of my review is that it is almost certainly not worth it, I cannot prove or disprove that it 'really works'. While my widow's peaks stopped growing, I am still continuing to see hair loss. Their return policy is absolutely not going to be long enough for anyone to determine in time if it will work for them either.

The long version:

Let me preface why exactly I decided to go with this model and my current situation, since people may be coming here from a similar situation as myself. I am seeing the first signs of hair loss, particularly with my widow's peaks. So, I decided I'd investigate it early instead of waiting until it's too late. I took a trip to Hair Club and got the free consultation. They offered their hair plan which included minoxidil, special shampoo and conditioner, vitamins, and a couple other things, one of which was a laser comb. Their asking price for this was 2,200 dollars. So I thought to myself, I could just buy all of these things myself since Hair Club was essentially just playing middle man. So for roughly half the price, I purchased everything in their package. So I bought this laser comb under the idea that I would be 'saving money' by purchasing it through Amazon instead of through Hair Club.

So once I receive the comb, the build quality is good and the lasers seem fine. You are at least getting something that doesn't seem like complete price gouging.

I would also like to specify that I used this thing religiously. It says to use it 3/4 days a week with one day in between for 8-12 minutes per session. And I did. Every week since I purchased it. I also used this in conjunction with all of the other products offered in the Hair Club package. I started in February of 2016 and it is currently July of 2016, so I'm 5 months into full regular use of multiple MPB prevention products.

Currently, my widow's peaks have either stopped receding or have at least slowed down in receding. Although my hairline in the center is now starting to recede. Since the recession started after I've began regular use of hair products, it seems safe to assume that while these products may have a temporary effect, they will not stop hair loss.

Their return policy from my understanding is 20 weeks, yet you will routinely hear that it takes months to see any real results (if that ever happens). So basically the return policy is meaningless unless you get cold feet shortly after purchasing it.

I am going to give this product 2 stars. The product itself is solid quality and it may have helped slightly, but with much cheaper alternatives and the guessing game involved with something so expensive, it just isn't worth it.",0
"Love this stuff, works great for me.",1
It ripped at the seems after only 2 uses. Will not be purchasing again.,0
This curling iron gets so hot that it fried my hair. I am pretty disappointed. Even at the lowest temperature it burns. I had to unplug the curling iron in order to finish curling the rest of my hair. It does curl the hair but it also burns your hair.,0
"I had always had a rather cheap straightener ($40 - Ulta).  I really could not see paying for a Chi, but I did.  Then returned it.  My hair must be too fine, the moving plates did really ""grab"" my hair.  I bought this one and love it.  After getting this one, I primarily use for curling.  I might would look for one with more curved edges for curling had I known I would use it like this so much.  But it's a really great straightener.",1
love the color so much!!! And it is the easiest nail polish I have used to apply,1
"It most certainly gives your hair a shine.  Don't use it daily, just on special occassions.
Sort of pricey, but worth it.",1
"This is by far the beat Niacin cream out there, I originally got mine from my plastic surgeon but it was the smaller face version, i find that this is fine for the face as well and you get so much more for same price! the tube is huge",1
good!,1
It's ok but it leaves your hair feeling dirty!,0
The BEST!  Love this blow dryer especially cause its so light weight and is so powerful! Would highly recommend this product,1
"I don't know if I got an old one or what, but this perfume smells like spray starch. Or like a cross between spray starch and those old, unscented hairsprays (like ""Aqua Fresh""...do they even still sell those??).

Was totally bummed because everyone seemed so happy with this scent and I bought based on the reviews.

I ordered the ""L"" by Lolita at the same time and it smells great! Nothing at all like this other (and reviewers said they were close sisters), so maybe I did get a bad bottle.

Update: After 2 hours of smelling like spray starch, I scrubbed my skin with a hot washcloth. THEN it still smelled, but it smelled good! Musky/powdery/vanilla like people described. Still smelled strong, just no spray starch. And it smelled almost identical to the way the ""L by Lolita"" smells right out of the bottle.",0
"Very practical product.  Does what it is suppose to do, quick covering.
The spraying is a bit strong and not easily controlled.  I do it for my hair.  That worked well.  Could be a bit harder to do by self.  However, some practicing may make it right.",1
I have been using these pads for quite some time and they really help with my oily skin. I tend to break out around my chin area and these pads have helped stop that all together!,1
"If you have thin, fine hair like I do, this may be a good product to try.  It has definitely given my hair more body.  I have medium length fine hair and I am going to continue to use the product.",1
I received the mask today. The jar was broken and half the contents were spilled.  This is ridiculous.,0
"I saw someone review this perfume on youtube and I was so curious I had to purchase it. A 3.4 oz of this bottle on Sephora.com is $60 dollars, so I jumped on it when I saw it on amazon. I was a little skeptical at how cheap the price was compared to Sephora but considering the reviews I thought I'd give it a go. It does smell like warmth, cookies, cotton candy and any baked sweet thing you can think of.. However, I've noticed that the brand Aquolina is nowhere to be found on this perfume, not on the packaging or anywhere else and that was a little odd to me. Since I've never purchased this at a store I don't really have anything to compare it to. I checked out sephora's site and I looked up this perfume and I noticed that right above the ""Pink Sugar"" logo Aquolina's brand name is above it but it isn't on the one I just received from amazon. Idk.. It still smells great but I just wonder if I'm missing out on what IT ACTUALLY smells like if this one isn't by Aquolina..??? Has anyone else bought this at an actual store without the brand name anywhere on it? Just curious.",1
"Works great!  I am a professional and it is very light weight, not cumbersome. Heats up nice, but not too hot.  Sometimes with the diffuser on it can warm up a little much, but on the whole I like it.

I had to come back and edit this post, after using the blow dryer for over 6 months it is evident to me that there is a problem with the heating element. It does not get hot enough on the low setting but burns clients on the medium setting. Also, the diffuser does not stay on at all... Very frustrating!",0
Not as strong as my last dryer but I got used to it and like it now.,1
Doesn't work that well.. soo want a refund.. ,0
"Not as good as I hoped, surface leaves nail rough, not a fine finish like others I've had.  OK if you need to remove a lot of nail all at once, but don't expect a good finish.",0
"The bust cream is particularly absurd. I bought it for my wife. The bust cream is a silicone-like, clear cream, with a slight scent that dries clear. There's a big difference between a slightly tight feel on your skin and actually firming breasts. You need several pumps (each pump is not much cream) to have enough to cover your breasts. The stretch mark cream is a thin, white cream with a stronger scent. There's nothing remotely medical about these cosmetic lotions.

I really like the Mustela brand for their Stelatopia unscented moisturizing lotion, and we've used a ton of their milky bath oil when bathing our child, but these lotions are being marketed with pseudo scientific nonsense. The firming agents are a joke, with trace quantities of avocado that have no medical action.

It's a shame when a brand builds trust with one product, just to erode it with false claims on another.",0
Nice. Non greasy. A little goes a long way !  I will purchase this beauty product many more times for sure!,1

"I am a 48 year old woman who has had cystic acne along my jaw since I was a teenager. This BUFFERING LOTION cleared it up in two days! TWO DAYS! I also use the DRYING LOTION for occasional breakouts, but I love both products. I was very hesitant because of the price and the small container but, the buffering lotion goes on  like water, so the bottle lasts a long time. My 13 year old daughter loves the DRYING LOTION for her regular pimples and it does an amaing job of clearing up even her hormonal face. I will continue to buy both products.",1
"I had high hopes for this product. Sadly it didn't work for me. I've used the product for almost 4 months.
It has a very nice citrus smell when you apply it and it doesn't stain clothes from what I've noticed but the moment I start to sweat the product makes my under arms smell terrible. I've only gone through very few complete days without noticing the effect of the deodorant wearing off. I also noticed this makes me sweat more than usual.
For this price I would recommend looking elsewhere.",0

"First let me say that I received this product for free to try as a Bzz Agent.

Ok, so I have really fine hair. Not baby fine, more like boring, limp, stringy fine. I can't do anything with it. It doesn't hold a curl, it doesn't look cute straight out of the shower, it just lies there flat & icky.

I was really skeptical trying this product because I've tried many other ""volumnizing"" shampoos before, but hey - this girl is pleasantly surprised. This spray gel is light, and doesn't leave my hair all goopy & sticky. I used the shampoo & conditioner first, then after the shower sprayed directly onto my wet hair, brushed it through & then just blow dried. I didn't do anything fancy at all...and yet, wow. It looks pretty darn good! My husband even asked if I went to the hair salon. Ha! That's funny & worth buying this stuff just for that.",1
"I buy this product every 3 months.  Usually you have to remove the foil safety seal on the inside of the bottle, however when I received the lotion from them this past Friday, there was no seal, and it felt like half the bottle was missing.  I will be filing a complaint with Amazon today.",0

"Malibu used to make EC Mode.  However, they've discontinued that line.  This product is what Malibu recommended as a replacement.  I have really hard water that tends to turn my blonde hair a little brassy.  Yes, I color my hair.  This does work really well to get the hard water build-up out and remove that brassy tone.  I also have naturally curly hair.  It didn't weigh my curls down.  My hair is also dry.  Not damaged, just dry.  This didn't provide quite enough moisture to use as a daily shampoo and conditioner.  I think this will be a set that I use about once a week to get the gunk out.  I'll stick with my more moisturizing shampoo and conditioner the rest of the month.  I think it would work great as a daily shampoo and conditioner for someone with more normal or oily hair.  The weekly treatment is also great.  But with my hair being dry, I think I'll stick with using it once every two weeks.",1
"I received this product YESTERDAY! My KP is horrible and the recent break outs have kept me inside the house numerous times this summer. Desparate, I tried the product as soon as it arrived. Took a shower and then let it sit on my skin a few minutes then rinsed. I noticed my skin reacted the same way it reacts when I swim in the ocean, it stung a little and the bumps rose to the surface. I applied the product again before bed but left it in for 1/2 hour and then rinsed it off. I cannot believe my skin this morning!!! In one day this liquid has signifigantly improved my KP & skin tone! The redness is gone, bumps are drastically reduced in size! Yesterday I wouldn't dare go in public exposing my arms! Totally different story today!!!! I never take the time to leave feedback, just too busy. But i felt obligated to reach out to those living with the embarrassment of severe KP. Try this!!! I hope it works for you too!!!

UPDATE 9/3/17: Lessons learned with KP... I absolutely still stand by my earlier review. This product definitely clears up the surface my skin quickly but as with most quick results products it's temporary and only lasts several days. I'm buying this today to use for the days leading up to my wedding and confident it will work well, as it always does for me. For long term daily treatment I use products with a combination of AHA/BHA + salicylic acid. Paula's Choice Resist has worked well for me but there are other products with these active ingredients. I also use chemical peels to get the dead dry skin off the surface (currently using Dr Gross peels/wipes in extra strength but too expensive to continue after my wedding).

Salt is ALWAYS in my arsenal for those times when I need clear skin fast, a must-have for me!",1
I have been using it for years. However your purchase was too expensive.,1
"This is not a good flat iron, period. It doesn't straighten my hair, just makes it frizzy. Ive had much cheaper irons that do a better job.",0
"I have heard this is great...I find it kind of creates a matte finish...almost powdery, which I don't really like..",1
Live the color,1
"I needed a good facial sunblock that I could wear everyday. After A LOT of research, like A LOT, of research I decided to purchase this one. I have rosacea and need to keep my skin protected without gunking it up. This seems to do the job. It leaves my skin a little oily/shiny but I haven't' been sunburned. I haven't tried layering it under makeup but I don't see why it wouldn't work. Is unscented, which is a must for me.",1
It lasted for 6 months and it just doesn't get hot anymore,0
I love the floral smell but not sweet. It is a lovely fragrance,1
Great summer color,1
I did not like this product. It made my hair feel dirtier and it feels like wet sand but in a paste. It did give volume but not in a messy sexy way; more like just dirty messy. It was expensive and now I have so much of it that I can't use. Blah...,0
works well,1
"It doesnt work. The orange/skin colored one is useless to me because its not my skin tone. The green is more white than green and doesn't cover red. The yellow is useless. it doesnt cover dark circles at all. The purple doesnt even work and i wish i didn't buy this. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! INSTEAD: for dark circle correction, buy terracotta colored eyeshadow and apply that lightly over your dark undereye circles before you apply concealer it works really well. For redness correction, just use foundation",0
"I enjoy this product. It absorbs nicely into the skin, and doesnt cause my face to break out. The reason I gave it four stars and not five, is because its a tab bit runny, and pours out quickly from the tube.",1
"Yeah everyone was right, the formula isn't as advertised. It is full of weird junk, I returned it.",0
Thank you for a great product and excellent representative assisting me,1
"This product didn't meet any expectations, 100% did not work on me",0
It always saves  my skin when it has dry spot or sunburn... I love this brand..,1
"I have really been enjoying this brush. I had heard about Clarisonic, but didn't want to pay the price (I suppose it's only $20 less if you buy the original Mia - though I think Mia's brush heads are more expensive). I had been using the CVS Brand version of the spinning Olay brush for a few years - which I had loved, but I wanted to see what the fuss was about with the sonic brushes when mine other one died. This sonic brush seems to make my face much smoother than just the simple spinning brush version.

Pros: AntiMicrobial Brushhead - Sonic cleansing feature - price.  It makes my face feel more exfoliated and smoother than with the Olay-style brush. Helps with the acne (It's part of my regime which includes a heavily researched cocktail of supplements, LED Light therapy, and benzyl peroxide in various degrees of strength) - so while I'm sure this brush helps quite a bit, it's admittedly a team effort.

Cons: Beeping! I wish I could turn off the beeping. I know how long I want to brush each section of my face - no need for hand-holding here. I worry about waking people since I am the early riser. It also makes the obnoxious sound when you charge it, when it needs to be charged, and sounds like it is drowning sometimes when I'm in the shower (which is funny and disconcerting at the same time).  You can dampen the sound if you put your thumb on the right spot near the bottom of the handle, but usually by the time I remember to do that, it's too late.

Thoughts: If it didn't have the beep feature, I'd give it 5 stars. Because of the beeping (which is high pitched, very loud, and shrill), I'm probably going to go with the Clarisonic Mia when this device eventually needs to be replaced.",1
"Nice sheer polish.  It does give your nails a healthy glow as I saw on the ""TODAY"" show.  I hold back on the 5th star because I had to use so many layers to get he desired look. Low fumes too.",1
"Smells great, similar to Creed's Virgin Island Water without the coconut. Unfortunately it only lasts a couple of hours. Good for the summer, especially if you plan on going in the water, as a longer lasting fragrance would be washed away anyway.",1
Really good,1
Dont buy it. Not the same.,0
"More on the orange side, but I still like it.",1
Wasn't really impressed.,1
"Oribe's signature shampoo is hands down the best shampoo I have ever tried.  I'm a ""prawduct"" junkie, so I have tried just about everything on the market from Abba to Zerran.  I have very dry, curly hair and very sensitive skin.  Most products irritate and annoy my skin and scalp.  And, my curly hair freaks out with most products.  It's either too kinky, or too dry, or too fuzzy, or too greasy, or too flat... well, you get the idea.  This shampoo was amazing.  It gives me clean, gorgeous hair without the squeak of overdry cleaning or the detergents found in most shampoos.  My hair feels soft.  And, the really great thing is, it only takes a SMALL amount of shampoo to do it.  This stuff is VERY concentrated.  It takes less than half the amount of this shampoo to get the job done, compared to other shampoos.  So ounce for ounce it's pricey, but worth it.  The signature conditioner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oribe-Signature-Conditioner-6-8-oz/dp/B00203SE2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oribe Signature Conditioner, 6.8 oz</a>&nbsp;from this product line is also amazing, and they work very well together.  My curls have NEVER looked so good.  Every day, I have beautiful, soft, touchable curls with no fussing, just great hair, every day.  It looks and feels awesome.  I am so in love with this product line.  I've been using this with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oribe-Hair-Care-Supershine-Moisturizing-Crme-5-oz/dp/B00203Q9B4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oribe Hair Care - Supershine Moisturizing Crme - 5 oz</a>, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oribe-Curl-by-Definition/dp/B002LC5QNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oribe Curl by Definition</a>.  I don't get the stickiness or tackiness of other styling products.  My hair just feels really soft.  My curls are defined and bouncy, and they look good all day.  And, best of all, I'm not buying any more ""prawduct.""  Just this.",1
Difficult to load a blade. One must dissemble to top portion of the razor; it comes completely apart. Would recommend a butterfly style as it is easier to load and clean.,0
"Not a pleasant smell, no foam, the product that was sent to me was probably postponed. Is it treated like a European customer? Disappointed not only with this product, but also with others.",0
olaplex is great but I got a fake,0
IT's a favorite of mine!,1
"I'm on the hunt for a cleanser that works for my sensitive, acne prone and combination skin. With the mostly positive reviews I was hoping for positive results but it really dries out my skin around the mouth area. It's an expensive productive for me so I will use it in the smallest amount to wash oily areas of my skin and for my body, but doesn't work for me as a overall face cleanser.",0
Made my hair look and feel like straw.  I cannot believe they have the audacity to charge nearly $30 for this stuff.,0
"Not as good as I expected, a bit disappointed! It said fast dry but it's not that fast, it said after using it there will have no frizzy hair but it's not!",0
"Beautiful, long lasting color. What more can we ask for?",1
Smells great.  No greasy residue after.  Moisturized well.  I'm happy,1
"You can get 9 samples of the Mario Badescu line on their website, but let me tell you it took forever. For the samples you do their online skin analysis and it will tell you what to buy. Make sure you click the box to get emails and in three days you get another email with a link to get the samples. So I had to do the skin analysis four times (over the course of like six months) to even get the email and then the link was dead. I was irritated and emailed them directly and about four months after the email I got my package, so about a year. You can just use the recommendations from their site to help you pick the correct items. One girl on here said she has really oily skin and she hated this product, but this is for sensitive dry skin, so no wonder it had the opposite effect and made her 10x more oily. Even if you don't really care about the samples use their skin analysis, it's very helpful sorting through all of their products. This stuff is amazing. I've always had nice skin but this stuff has brought it to the next level. I use it paired with their botanical exfoliating scrub and it's amazing. It's gentle enough I can use both products every day without feeling like I'm overly oily or like I've taken a layer of skin off my face. No hives, which I get with almost everything (that's why I waited for the samples). I have to admit I searched for a cheaper alternative but this is the cheapest of this type of cream that I could find.",1
Makes a loud sound like a dentists drill!! and does not get very hot. Returning it.,0
Great base coat,1
This came highly recommended by a couple of friends. I like the fact that it gets absorbed by the skin quickly and it's not oily. Be careful not to get it near or in your eyes.,1
Everything was ok.,1
Like the results,1
"Seems to work. I didn't previously check the size of the bottle, just went off the picture so I was shocked how itty bitty it was when I recieved it. Seems to work but I hate the feeling of hair spray in my hair and that's exactly what this feels like. I guess the technology just isn't there yet to use product without the unpleasant feeling of something in your hair. I wouldn't refer to this feeling as ""texture"" as the product described.",0
"This brush is utterly amazing and worth the investment. I have long hair, so I bought the large boar bristle/nylon mix and my hair has never been so shiny and soft.  Great for blow drying as well.  My hair looks smooth and sleek after a blow dry.  A bit expensive, but it will last forever.  Highly recommended!!",1
"No matter how much I shake the bottle before application, this sunscreen leaves tiny white specks on my face.  Won't buy it again.",0
"Bought the shampoo and conditioner in liter size, so I've been stuck with it for some time. Beats drugstore low-end brands, but still disappointing by far for salon labels! Made my hair dry, and my scalp even drier! The more I use it the drier my scalp is! I should have paid closer attention to the ingredients list because the ingredients are not the best! I wouldn't recommend!",0
"I have been using this duo Glo Minerals for years. I love that it is applied under the eye with out looking cakey. It has two colors, one for under eye and the other for covering blemishes on the face. Glo minerals uses high quality ingredients. I am very prone to acne breakouts, I never have to worry when I use Glo Mineral products. My only gripe is that they do not make a larger size. I tend to go through this in a little over a month.",1
Plumps up roots and gives great volume.  It works better if I spray it onto the roots and rub in in before drying.,1
"This does a nice job of removing eye makeup, but I did still wake up with a few under eye smudges the morning after using. The fabric feels nice on your skin, although it does stain a little - may depend on your brand of makeup.",1
good,1
Great ionic hairdryer with heavy duty cord,1
"Pretty good product; however, it didn't soften my cuticles as much as I had hoped. Not sure I would purchase this item again.",1
Doesn't work as well when I use it vs my stylist but she does everything better.  But it does make my hair feel thicker.,1
Great price. Arrived on time. Works as advertised.,1
"oh I am so happy to have my ""joy"" it is very small but I'm happy",1
"It's pretty color, but the photos they show if this are not anywhere close to this. I'm a little bummed",0
"I bought this on recommendation since I was having issues starting out shaving with a DE razor.  It's not unscented, it has a ""musky"" scent.  I haven't found a difference between shaving with a Pre-Shave oil and Proraso Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus & Menthol and with just the Proraso.  I spent a lot of money for this and I think it was a bad investment.",0
"I got this set so I could find my favorite flavor.  Turns out that is the cinnamon one.  Bad news is I just looked at the expiration on the last tube I was trying and it expired in 2007!!!  It's 2012, so that's 5 years.  Crazy annoying!  The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because it accomplished my objective.

I didn't even think about it expiring when I got it, but you can bet I'll be looking from now on.  I'm sorry, but that's totally unacceptable that they would even release these while so old.  I could understand 5 months, but 5 years?  Luckily, it's just toothpaste, so I doubt there was any negative impact.  I'm very disappointed in Amazon.  I used to rave about them, but now I'm going to be saying, ""buyer beware"".  This is the third time I've been burned.  First was with a name/picture misrepresentation and second was old dried up mascara.  Anyway:  BUYER BEWARE",0
Color in picture prettier than actual color.  Blue is more of a muted blue color.,0
"I was very disappointed once I received this straightener. It's basically the bootleg version of the original one you see in stores. It doesn't close shut all the way when you're doing your hair and it almost sounds like your frying your hair every time you run through it. You're better off buying a Chi, or the Paul Mitchell brand at least those will last you about a year or so. I should have listened to the reviews but instead I ignored them and ordered it anyway because I was so excited and I really needed one. I was lazy and didn't return it right away so now I'm stuck with a straightener I paid $100 for that barely works and burns my hair. They are seriously making a ton of money off us by charging us the price of the original straightener and giving us the crappy knock off version. You live and you learn I guess..",0
Received my product in just a few days. It is a great product and I recommended it to my friend Cookie Burke. I had let her try it and she liked it . She also ordered it .,1
"As a girl with chronicly oily skin, I've tried everything to tame it.  This stuff didn't help. It certainly didn't cause a purge of blackheads.  Tried it multiple ways, none helped the product be effective.

Why is it even called Silver?  There's no colloidal silver in it.",0
I purchased a small bottle to try this perfume out. Not  impressed. You spray it and shortly after it doesn't smell.  Like if you didn't have any perfume on.,0
"When we first tried this conditioner we were struck by how soft it left our family's hair. It worked particularly well for my wife, who's hair is very dry. It's a quality product and the Amazon vendor's price is still pretty low, despite the shipping cost.",1
"Oh my, that cord is long enough to dry the neighbors hair!!  Wrapped 75% of it in rubber band.  Great dryer, attachment falls off easily.",1
Product caused me to break out.  I was trying it for my rosacea and I suspect it was just too heavy for my skin.,0
Wasn't that appealing to me.,0
You can not go wrong with Jack Black! The secret is not to lose them before they run out!,1

"Recommended by my dermatologist (and now ME!), this product is one that I had never heard of or seen in the retail stores. I guess the price scares
people away, but the product is great. It looks like any regular white-colored lotion but a little goes a long way and it doesn't feel like the greasy stuff you get for less money. It goes right into your skin and in less than about ten seconds, you can hardly even tell you put it on except for a nice feeling on your skin. No grease, no smell, nothing. And I use this every morning 15 min. before I go out in the Arizona sun, which is brutal. Great protection.
Pricey, but to me, worth it. This company has some great products, and many sun lotion choices too. But this one is really nice. Hope you like it!",1
Does not work well.,0
"I was very disappointed in this product.  For me personally, I have found Jane Iredale products to be hit and miss.  This one was a miss for me.
The color was just too, too light, so didn't show well on my skin. I suppose if you have very fair skin, it might be ok?  The couple times I did
have it on, it didn't last at all.",0
"As usual , Paul Mutchell products don't disappoint. I have curly hair and this sculpting lotion gives it a sheen and style like no other. I shampoo every other day and the styling lotion allows me the freedom to get up on alternate days and have worry free hair. In fact, on those days I have a softer looking curl. Works well.

Amazon pricing makes it more affordable then buying in a salon & even better pricing than most beauty supply stores.",1
"I even showed this product to a sephora worker right in the cologne isle at the store,  and the comparison was a huuuuge difference.  This cologne is watered down with something else to make it full,  but the amount of 'actual' stuff isn't even enough to last an hour.  RIP OFF.  Just buy the stuff regular price if you want any quality from it.  Don't go for this scam.  I mean it didn't even come wrapped up,  meaning obvious tampering.  I'm extremely dissatisfied. (had to buy another cologne from them)",0
"Really nice.  Makes your face feel clean, soft, and smooth.  My only complaint is the container itself.  The way its designed, you have to be careful not to dispense too much, or to lose some.",1
Broke out in a rash from it!,0
"I bought a gallon of this from another vendor but I absolutely love it for my super thick hair. I no longer use shampoo or conditioner, and only use this every other day because I've noticed a decrease in oil buildup since using this! I will say though that the reports of hair loss is true since I have noticed an increase in the amount of hair coming out in the shower, but since I have so much hair, it doesn't bother me...yet. Definitely worth a try if you are trying to avoid using harsh shampoos on your hair.",1
"Lo estoy usando desde hace meses y nada que ver, he usado otros productos sin resultados visiblemente importantes. Para lo que cuesta debera ser mejor.",0
Feels nice after shaving.,1
"I had a T3 hair dryer for about 10 years and loved it, then my German Shepherd puppy got tangled up with the cord and it landed on the floor and broke. I bought this BaByliss hair dryer to replace it. I have fine curly hair and even with a leave in conditioner this dryer left my hair a tangled snarly mess. It has a lot of power to dry your hair fast but it just didn't work for me or my curls. I decided to return and buy the T3 featherweight 2i. The T3 dries my hair fast on the low speed setting and even without a diffuser my curls looked fantastic!",0
"I was extremely excited to finally receive this when it came to me in the mail. You should have been in my head to understand the excitement I felt reading all the amazing reviews, a new hairdo; a new outlook on life! Before my hair had sideswept bangs and one day I decided to part it with a more texturized elevated top. That day I did all my research on the best products for thick long-ish hair. Most of the sites I came up swore by this product and American Crew Fiber.

This product smells like licorice and looks like glue stick in my hair. I though it was maybe me or maybe it was something in the elements but no. Before this product arrived in the mail I went to Wal-Mart to try out American Crew Fiber and was stunned when my hair stayed up, parted and texturized THE WHOLE DAY. I was thinking whoah, I can only imagine what Baxters will do. Well it did nothing but cause me stress because I really wanted it to work on me. I wanted to believe the beautiful glass jar full of nutrients and licorice smell but nothing. My hair more or less looked dull and flat and I tried every combination to see what I could do. Damp with blowdryer, dry with fingers, dry with palms, using more of it and nothing it all looked the same. Not to mention it did not ""clump"" my hair into a texturized mold. Instead it look like a bunch of fly-aways hairs made up my scalp. I honestly can not recommend this product but MAYBE it will work for YOU. For the price and lack of reviews (yes 3 or 4 reviews sprinkled here and there should have warned me) I would go and just buy/try American Crew Fiber.

My hair looked dull for a while and I had not seen that beautiful dark brown color I once had and with two uses of American Crew Fiber it came back. It looked like I had a new weave in my hair and not to mention the fact of it's strong hold and texturizing paste like qualities without looking like I had anything in my hair.

My hair type is 3 inches on the top, thick not coarse black hair.

* Note: I spent double my money having to replace this product",0
"They changed the formula, want my money back.",0
"Awful smell.  The sample in the department store smelled totally different.  You only need to put one spray on, if you can tolerate that!",0
"Purchased this on sale after deciding to ditch cartridge systems. I wish I had done this years ago--safety razors provide a far superior shave and also turn a chore into a bit of a ritual. Once you become proficient you will be able to do a three pass shave in only slightly more time than a one-pass shave with a cartridge razor. I was a bit intimidated at first  however after a few days I was fairly confident and after a few months its now second nature. i would recommend watching a few videos online as well to learn how to use the blade--it;s very imprtant to remember to lt the razor do the work--use no pressure!! Unless you want to slice up your face...

 Anyway--the product--the Merkur is solid and somewhat heavy in the hand. I love the simplicity of the design as well as the chrome looks. The handle is well balanced as the is the razor itself over all. Adding/removing blades is simple and intuitive. my research indicated that this was a great intro level safety razor and so far I have found that to be true. Eventually I will likely ""upgrade"" to a razor that allows me to manually adjust the closeness level. Until then-and even after- I highly recommend this razor to beginners and value shoppers alike.",1
"it seems work for my teens. Not oily at all and for my teen boy, he is willing to apply to his face. Good enough for me.",1
"Excellent product,",1
"I just oppened the box and what a surprise. This item is expired and whoever packed should have noticed how bad the box looks, the pads are yellow!! If someone uses this will have to straight to the Doctor! I expect full refund for this.",0
"compared to other conditioner's for guys this doesnt seem to work very well, especially for the price.  Go for a different product",0
husband loved it,1
"I have been using this for few weeks now, and I think I am beginning to see a little difference.  Time will tell, I guess.",1
"If you like your hair to be straight, non static and smooth this is the one!  My hair is thick and very unevenly wavy and frizzy.  About a dime size amount, work into wet hair, blow dry and flat iron...this keeps my do in place and feels clean, not sticky.  This sellers price was accurate and I will  purchase again!",1
"I like this product, works well.",1
"This stuff works great, smells great and the menthol/eucalyptus combo feels really refreshing. Unfortunately the menthol/eucalyptus ends up being the caveat: I don't like to use this stuff in the winter because rinsing my face with cold water post-shave feels shockingly cold to me. I love it the rest of the year round but that's why I keep Musgo Real on hand for when I don't want to feel like I've been ice-stabbed in the face. Maybe I'm a wimp and others like that sensation. You do get an excellent shave from it regardless.",1
"This product straighter my hair instead of curling it. I have very long hair (waste length) so I assumed a larger barrel would work for me, evidently not this one.",0
"i've seen a  change in my skin since i've had this , not a miracle product but very good .",1
"This shampoo does thicken my hair some.  It feels nice and smooth, not dry like some other volumizing shampoos.  However, with every shampoo that I try the first time, I wash my hair in a big white plastic bowl so I can see if it causes any hair loss or color loss from my hair dye.  I had hoped it would work for me as it is very difficult to find a shampoo that doesn't cause hair loss or hair color and at the same time, thickens my hair.
Unfortunately, at the first try, this shampoo caused hair loss and some hair color was washed off also, so I had to return it.
Back to my Burt's Bee Baby Shampoo Original, which doesn't cause any hair loss or the loss of hair color, but if there is another one that does all this plus thickens my hair, I would love to try.",0
Nice,1
"I bought an expensive dryer hoping it would last. Dead after less than a year with a twice-a-week usage. It is covered with 2 year warranty. Catch: You ship it at your expense and must attach $35 money order for ""processing"". I opted to buying a new one for $25 at costco.",0
This smells good and really helps out when you can't wash your hair anytime soon.  It's a good freshen up.  Good to get rid of oily looking hair.  Watch out because if you put too much it will end up all over your clothes.,1
Below expectations!!,0
It's been a few weeks now and so far so good. Slight improvement in my overall skin appearance. I haven't witnessed any miracle transformations take place yet but it also hasn't broken me out which is huge.,1
"The smell is perfect. One of the best perfumes.
But it lasts very small amount of time.

I have to change this review because I am now using it on daily basis .... and I could tell it does not last",0
"Smells like candy.......I hated the smell, no adult should walk around smelling like a candy store!!!",0
i think this is a fake. The bottle is much bigger than the one i have and it smells really harshly of chemicals. the writing is different. its obvious now that i think about it,0
Doesn't work at all.,0
"After some extensive research on lash-restoring products, I finally decided to try Talika because the price was neither astronomical nor cheap, and because of reviews I had read that I believe now are likely bogus.

After over two months of application, I have seen no change in my eyelash length, whatsoever. Perhaps this conditioner helps to prevent eyelash loss, but it does nothing to enhance growth. I have good eyelashes but wanted to see if the hype was true and that these products actually help your eyelashes grow. So far, this particular product does not meet expectations.

I may try something else.

Talika does make a great little nylon mascara product ""Lash Extender"" that is better than false eyelashes and easy to apply. That product I would HIGHLY recommend. This product? Useless.",0
"Hate the price for the size.. My fault, that I did not notice the small bottle size.. I have purchased this perfume for years and always got about 3 times that amount for very close to the price.. So beware that you can get this other places way cheaper...",0
"Too light and difficult, didn't do what it is suppose to do and I was disappointed as I usually love all the products from Oribe.",0
"After reading all the good reviews I decided to give it a try, but it was just a waste of money; it doesn't work at all, smells really strong but besides that it doesn't do anything else.",0
"Not what I expected at all. I bought this product to help camouflage a bruise and perhaps a tattoo. It did not cover to the degree I expected. The bruise and tattoo were still visible and after a couple of hours they were completely visible. It does not dry,  it stays tacky so a powder or setting spray is definitely needed. Is not water resistant. I would not recommend  this product for the price.  Any cake make up would do the same. I would not buy again. 40 bucks wasted.",0
Really doesn't do much. Spray dry colored shampoo works much better.,0
"This product is awesome.  The color on the website was a little different.  However, I took a little educated guess and I was right.  Will definitely buy this item again.  Not greasy or cake looking.  Smooth on the skin.  Just wish it wasn't so pricey.  Great product, though",1
"I don't write too many reviews, but I have to write this one. It has been a bad experience with this shampoo, now I have dandruff and itchy scalp, I had to wash my hair with shampoo to control the dandruff and itchy scalp. This is unacceptable for a so EXPENSIVE shampoo, plus, my hair looks the same as when I wash it with any regular shampoo. I don't recommend this shampoo to anybody. I don't know if it is a knockoff, as the other reviews are saying, but it didn't work for me at all. Save Your Money!",0
What an awesome little palette to give as a gift it's amazing Lorac quality in a small portable palette. Gave as a gift and was a major hit will definitely give as gift again to a lucky lady for birthday/Christmas!,1
"Opi used to be my go to nail polish, but my last couple of bottles have gone on like molasses even when they were new.  I added thinner -- like you do for old and almost used up bottles -- but still it was thick and uneven.  I wouldn't recommend it or buy it again.

Two stars for a great polish that used to be.",0
Not great for thick hair!,0
Amazing,1
"My skin has been drier since I started using this. The dryness is showing up more every day, when I put on foundation. It's not aggravating my skin, no breakouts, but dry skin with foundation is ugly skin, and ugly skin is the reason I bought this! It's just ugly for a completely different reason now. Sigh.  It's certainly not going to be moisturizing enough for summer, or at night.

I wouldn't purchase this again.",0
"Unfortunately, this diffuser does not fit my Babyliss Rapido dryer.",0
"It's a bit darker than I expected it to be, and there are sparkles in it, which I like. Very hydrating; I recommend exfoliating before you apply it though, because it's not going to hydrate enough to help really chapped lips. Almost looks like a lipstick, and applies more like a lip balm. I really enjoy it.",1
the plates do not come together tight enough,0
I am completely WOWED!!!!!! It's not kidding when it says it lasts a week(like most products with their bulls*** claims) I will be a loyal user and will tell everyone about this polish!,1
"it has a very strong baby powder smell and it stopped spraying after a month.  Could not unclog with a pin, holding upside down, or heating up in warm water.  It held my hair alright and had a little shine. The can design is the best part. would not buy again",0
"Love it,will bye another pomade from the same collection.",1
Why is everybody calling this intense Euphoria but on the photo it says Liquid Gold euphoria.,0
"I got this recommended by an specialist and paid far to much.
The price is great and shipment quick as well.
It is a good value and works for older skin and protects younger skin from aging as well.",1
"I don't know what happened to their formula, but my last order destroyed my hair.  I have wicked breakage and sever thinning which has lessened since I stopped using it.  Im very upset by this, this product USED to be awesome.  It was the only shampoo I could use that would allow me to comb my hair fresh out of the shower without yanking half of it out due to tangling.",0
"Slant bar razors are not something new.  When I bought this one, I retired it's predecessor which I bought from a cutlery chain in New York City called Hofritz in 1967.  I suspect that it was made by Merkur for Hofritz.  In any case, slant bar razors give a noticeably better shave than regular safety razors.  Because of the slanted head, the blade comes down at an angle and slices through the hairs rather than chopping through them.  It gives a smoother shave and the blades have a longer life too.

A couple of tips, until you get used to the handling, avoid using a lot of pressure on the razor. Stretch the skin you are shaving, its a big help in avoiding nicks and be sure to rinse the shaver in hot water after you are done.  The build up of hair cuttings and shaving cream on the blade dries like sandpaper and will ruin a blade after a couple of shaves.",1
Good for one day and after u shower the next day it starts to peel off,0
Love this stuff!! This is my third pregnancy using this product and I have not gotten any stretch marks at all.,1
Great stuff,1
I bought 2 bottles and one does not spray all the time.,0
the mascara was dry and the palette I have the colors already!! the eyeliner is just ok...,0
Not exactly what I expected. Wanted a blow drying style brush this is just a hot air brush hard to describe but definitely different. Not what I expected and gets crazy hot.,0
"Really good product!!! Made quiet a difference in my hair, my hair healthier and has more shine to it..love it!",1
how does anyone curl their lashes with this - I thought it would be a great item but boy was I wrong - it was expensive too for a curler - not work it,0
It's great stuff!,1
"Didn't work on my olive skin, probably ideal for very fair people.",0
"I've used this 3 times, and it is clearing up my stubborn hormonal breakouts on the sides of my chin/jaw. not a miracle overnight worker,but I can feel a blemish coming on in my cheek area, so that will be a real test because we all know how hard it is to get rid of hormonal breakouts! I like the cooling feeling and it is definitely calming.",1
The shampoo works really well but it is crazy expensive. The smell is not offensive but not exactly pleasant either. I have had better results when I let the shampoo sit on my hair for at least 10 minutes.,1
"I bought this specifically for airbrushing. It's so thick and gooey that it simply will not spray. It's about as thick as soft butter. It glops into my airbrush and refuses to come out. I even bought an Iwata gravity-fed airbrush so it could flow down into the brush. Still won't spray. It needs to be thinned but I have no idea how to thin the silicone based primer. Alcohol won't do
It.

It goes on shiny and a bit greasy. Not what I expected after using Smashbox primer that goes on easily, dries almost instantly and dries to a very matte finish, ready for powder.",0
"It does what its supposed to do.

It does give lift and volume for sure! The only drawback is that your hair is not that touchable after applying. Leaves your hair very dried out and ""straw / hay"" feeling",1
"I have been looking for Borghese Profumo for years.  It appears this particular item was discontinued from the Borghese line in department stores a few years ago.
After wearing this light, clean scent one time I knew it was one that I would need to keep in my collection at all times.  You saved me.  The price is great and I smell delicious!  Thank you",1
I was told by my beautician to buy Nioxin Scalp Treatment 4 - so I thought I did - This product says Nioxin Scalp Treatment 4 but it is really a scalp sunscreen.  This is not what I intended to buy.,0
"As always, paul Mitchell detangler is an awesome product, and getting it at a good price is even better.  You'll like it.",1
"I tried the product diligently for two weeks twice a day.  No results not even a little reduction of arm wrinkles,would not recommend",0
Have used other airbrush liquid make up before that I loved. I thought I would try this one and will definitely not buy/use again. The liquid is too thick for the airbrush machine. ...it clogged instantly. I tried a few times and never once worked.,0
"Very difficult to apply unless you have an applicator with it.  Cannot see on top of my head, so hard to see if it covers the thin spots.  They really ought to come up with something better, since at least one out of three men and one out five women have thinning hair!",0
"My favorite brand.  Been using it for over 20 years.
I have nothing more to say.",1
This is my second brush in 10 years. My first one finally wore out so I got a new one off Amazon. The new one brushes glides through my long wet hair effortlessly. It's so much better than a wet brush.,1
This product is exactly what it is suppose to be. I works great on my hair.,1
Excellent brow brush. Very buildable and natural looking. The push up pencil is very thin. Almost hair thin. On the plus side it allows for better control and definition. On the down side it takes much longer to apply. Also I ran out of product much sooner than I expected. I have this in 3 colors and would say it's definitely worth it. This brow pencil made my thin almost non-existent brows look lovely. Tip: use a shade lighter on the inner part of the brows for a more natural finish.,1
Great stuff.,1
Terrible product. Made my hair flat and greasy. Should have read the reviews more closely. Waste of  money.,0
"Too good , grate work ,",1
"Excellent fragrance, a more masculine scent than what I normally wear. Also, this isn't one where someone else will be wearing, so you will be unique!",1
"Not that great, streaked.my face broke out.",0
"I will update this review after a few more uses. I have had 3 sessions I believe, actually maybe it's been 4 with no noticeable result yet",0
very good product. I have been using this product since 2008 on my son. I am having it again for my coming baby. The product was delivered on time.,1
Love the way it cleans the make-up off with a small amount of cleanser.  Will buy again.,1
"Before using it, i put little bit of it o my eyes to see if it is burning or not. and when i do that my eyes just burned like a hell. be careful when you use it to your baby, they may cry a lot.",0
"Sebastian crude clay was awesome. Craft clay is average, and everyone agrees, why on earth did they swap a great product for a useless product???

Luckily, finally I have found something that works just the same as crude clay, stiff miracle mud, amazing!",0
"Great stuff. A little goes a long way, and it smells great.",1
No improvement whatsoever. None! I feel like I'm applying water to my lid. There is no smell no thickness to the substance of this supposed eyelash growth serum. Very disappointed. Money down the drain.,0
"Hair dryer works fine, but the handle gets so hot it will literally burn you like a hot iron. I can't believe this isn't mentioned more in the comments. I have burned my hand on it many times, causing me to yell out and drop it on the floor. Works great if your willing to dry your hair while wearing an oven mitt. It seemed to not heat up as fast the first few uses (I do have long thick hair), but now handle is hot enough to burn my hand in just seconds. I have never had a hair dryer that did this, even with all my past cheap drug store purchases. I thought I was upgrading with this purchase, but now drying my hair is a painful ordeal.",0
"This doesn't work! After a couple of years of using this laser and thinking that it's thinning my hair, I'm going to cut my losses and throw it out. Its slightly painful, especially on sensitive areas, and I really wished it would have done what it claims; remove hair permanently. But it doesn't. And it's expensive!! I've used it on areas of thin hair and where there were just a few hairs, but it doesn't matter. It just doesn't work. I'm disappointed.",0
"What's with all the hype? This stuff is ok for results, I guess, but the smell is waaay overpowering! Ew! You can't even breathe in the room after you spray it, and the smell lingers alllll day. You can't get away from it. So glad I spent a load on it and never ever use it. What a waste",0
I ordered the larger size after trying the travel size.  It does take off make-up and leaves your skin feeling fresh and soft.  It does not take off mascara easily - for that stick with Bi-Facil.,1
I found this product through Petit Vours sample box. I started breaking out randomly for the first time in years so I used the sample and was blown away with how fast it cleared up blemishes. Almost overnight for small pimples. If you can afford it use this 2x a week to keep your skin clear!,1
"When this item arrived the polish was separated and gloppy. After several minutes of shaking it came back together, but when I applied it it was very gloppy, streaky (like white out) and took 4 coats to look solid white. I don't know if it's the product or if the seller sold an old polish that was no longer good. Either way, beware!",0
Product received not as described.  The picture and description showed a pump bottle but the product I received did not include a pump.,0
"Love this product!!! So happy you carry it, it was less than when I purchased it in the past . So happy I can now purchase this product from you. Sincerely

  Cindy Patterson",1
Doesnt decrease dry time!,0
Love it! Works great and love that it fits in my purse when I need it on the go!,1
"I'm sure it is great, but it broke me out!!",0
"First off before I tried this product my skin and beard were in perfect condition, no flaking, no redness and no itch. Now after using this starter kit for just two days my face is a complete mess, so much redness and itching. And the so called boars hair brush is a joke, I didn't even use it. If a brush hurts the palm of your hand what do you think it's gonna do to your face!",0
"Surprised see ratings close to 5 stars, by so many people!

It was the first time that I ordered Argan Oil products. Based on reviews, I ordered this (spray) and (oil) both by Agadir. I also ordered couple bottles of ""pure"" Argan oil from another brand.

Luckily that I ordered the pure one, along with this Argan by Agadir. So I can say, with certainty, that Agadir products have nothing to do with any Argan oil. And if they do contain Argan, probably no more than 5-10% of the ingredients!

I used the 'pure' Argan product, and my hair was transformed from dry, brittle texture into smooth, no frizz, mane of hair. And I only needed to apply 2 or 3 small drops, that's all. That's how strong and effective the pure stuff is.

After a week, I put the pure one aside, and started using Agadir spray. What a huge disappointment. This total waste of money, product is not only useless for hair, wish it was!, but actually made my hair look as if damaged. Dry and so brittle. Why? No idea. May be it contains many industrial chemicals! I wonder if the manufacturer can produce certificate showing how much natural ingredients in this spray. Bet you very little, or close to none. Not looking for organic, but anything that is natural, not chemical!

Major brands like Garnier, L'Oreal, etc, one finds in any good supermarket, drug store, works wonders on problem hair at fraction of the price. And won't damage your hair. Trusted source!

Recommend: buy Pure Argan Oil. Anything else is waste of time/money.",0
This is my new favorite mascara and the only one I use. Love the skinny brush and how well it goes on. Does not clump and never smears or rubs off. Cost is a bit much but I don't mind paying more for a mascara that stays on and works so well.,1
Love it so much. it's easy to apply and make your skin brighter. Received earlier than expected.,1
Excellent,1
Cannot use on fact or chest. Makes me break out.,0
Mother favorite.,1
Very satisfied and plan to order more in the future.,1
Perfect nude color for my olive skin I love it.,1
Too dark!!!,0
"Bought this for my husband it's truly incredible. It completely covers up the thinning patch. It's so natural, it's simply amazing",1
"As a lover of beauty products, I just had to try this for my crows feet and frown lines! I diligently used 2 tubes for months day & and night and the results are: it smoothes the skin on application. However, I did more harm in applying it to the sensitive eye areas, thus causing MORE wrinkles than were there originally. Too pricey for me with negative results. I'll spend my money on a permanent solution rather than keep giving demos for products that are not successful for me.",0
Not what i expected,0
"Our water softener isn't working so we needed this godsend for our hair!  It definitely helps, we do recommend to get the grease out of your hair.",1
Darker than expected,0
Some might say it bus expensive but you use so little and with a good badger hair shaving brush it provides a fantastic gel like lather that results in the best and closest shaved ever and this one container will last for an interminable period. Smells great. Love the Art of Shaving!,1
"A little oilier than I was expecting, but it dries fast, works pretty efficiently and is easy to use.",1
"Smells wonderful!  It is very hard to find a fragrance for my husband, and he likes it alot.  It seems to last a long time after you put it on.",1
I bought this hair dryer thinking it was the best for this price. I used it twice and really liked it. The third time it stopped working. I am returning it.,0
Even small rollers are too big for short hair.,0
"Had the opposite effect of what I wanted, made my hair curlier than ever before.",0
"I really like the adjustable heat settings, but my power switch quit working after about a year. The curling iron itself still works great, I just can't turn it off and have to unplug it.",1
Basically You pay money for a smelly water! I couldn't stand the smell and didn't like the product,0
This product was a waste of money and time.  I followed the directions and had no results whatsoever.  I do not recommend it.,0
"I have only used one body wash before this one which is the Truefitt India lime.  Truefitt washed fine, great later... but short on fragrance and what little fragrance it had only lasted maybe less than a half hour.  MB has a stronger fragrance, but not over powering.  It also lasts most of the day
up to 8 hours or so.  Nice manly scent but of course it is a matter of taste.  I would definitely consider buying this one again.",1
"Got these for my 12 year old daughter.  They were too flimsy to hold back her wild curls, but she loves wearing all three of them as bracelets together.  Go figure.",1
Good curling iron. Not sure it gets as hot as I would like it to.,1
"I love the Shampoo and conditioner that felt great on my scalp. However the thickening foam tangled my hair and made it get stuck together on the ends and break off instead of softening. I have considerable breakage from the volumising foam. They need to improve the foam, it feels like buildup on the hair. It does add body but makes it frizzy not soft body. Dissappointed!",0
Not worth the price at all. You can buy a toothbrush for $20 that vibrates and works just as good if not better. I wasted a lot of money and tried it for two weeks but it's just not worth it at all and doesn't do a better job than other toothbrushes. I also can't see myself actually using this for a year (which they claim it lasts that long). It would feel gross. Save your money,0
"I LOVE this lotion--it is worth the money!  It smells great, and feels even better.  However, the bottle came bent, and the lotion was leaking everywhere!  :-(",1
"Very good cream, I have seen improvement in the texture and elasticity of my skin",1
This is the best curling iron I have ever owned!  I love that the heat is adjustable so I can put it at the perfect heat to curl my hair.,1
"Doesn't work as well as head and shoulders on dandruff, but doesn't strip hair color and keeps my hair soft.",1
"I love oils, and couldn't resist getting this one from Jouer. It's really is a great one.
It's light, but packs a powerful punch. The oil sinks in quickly, leaving my skin soft but not shiny. It has a barely there scent that is pretty much undetectable. Only when I first apply, and if I'm smelling for it, do I notice any smell at all.
Best of all it can be used underneath my makeup without any meltdowns! I often use it by itself, but it works underneath my moisturizer at night, or spf during the day.
It feels nice, moisturizes well, and the price is on par with both it's quality and other brands.",1
"This product arrived completely opened. The shipping box had no damage, but when I opened the box, the box from the product was opened. Kinda weird.",0
All's good,1
"My skin was struggling with mild acne and left over acne scars from picking (yikes!) but after getting and using the PMD CONSISTENTLY I saw huge results! My skin is SO much smoother, and my left over scars have been fading tremendously. Not to mention, my skin has NEVER felt softer. Seriously. Life changer. Life. Changer.",1
"Fast delivery, Great Product!  Recommend to all!",1
I have sensitive skin and I had some issues with this product and had to return it. I'm sure it's not a widespread problem but if your skin easily breaks out you might have issues.,0
"i was looking for something that was very gentle (i have VERY sensitive and fair skin) yet effective - after all, you're not washing your face for the fun of it ...you want a facial cleanser that works but doesn't tax your skin.
this is it.  it has just a hint of clean smelling aroma.
this is my new, go to company for face products.",1
goodddddddd,1
I love this color. Its a true brown and not taupe.,1
"I've bought this product before and loved it, but for some reason this time around it really messed with my skin, I had to stop using.",0
"A new favorite, great moisture too!
Rosa Alonso",1
It does seem to help retain my color,1
"I've been using this cream for existing stretch marks for almost 3 months now, I don't see any improvement. I hoped that the price should be that high for some miracle product. But I was mistaken. No effect at all, wasted money. The smell did not bother me, though.",0
"There is no tint, and this is slightly oily, even though it says matte. I never use it... would not buy again",0
Different color what I expecting in the picture,0
"While this probably deserves a 5 star rating for how cool and sharp they are, I just can't imagine any pair of nail clippers being worth this much money. This is super small and folds completely flat. It also has a small, leather case for storage (a little tight to get into but it will soften). The clippers are super sharp and do a great job. The engineering in the design is really neat and I love how it folds out and becomes a tension spring. Very cool. But really, I'm not sure my nails are worth it.",1
wouldn't buy it again.  leaves hair really stiff.,0
Doesn't remove makeup better than Cetaphil wash and stings my eyes so badly (!!) without even removing makeup well. Makes me sad to see this waste of money in my shower. (MB products are usually outstanding),0
"I ordered 2 of these and think the product works well. The problem was when I went to unpack them, one of the bottles completely disintegrated after taking off the plastic wrapping and serum went everywhere. On top of that, shards of glass fell into the serum meaning its unsalvagable.",0
Great product!,1
"This item is mislabeled. It is not an eau de parfum as labeled by Amazon, but an eau parfume (scent spray) which is much lighter.",0
This must be a fake.  Spray it on several times and girlfriend can't smell it.  Its so faint and expensive.  Not worth the money AT ALL.,0
smells amazing,1
works well and has a good price. the smell is a bit much but goes away quickly. make sure to hold your breath while you spray.,1
have used PHYTO products for many years and they always are high quality and deliver. Phytorhum reminds me of being on an island with a tropical drink. This is a great shampoo for everyday. A little goes a very long way. Highly recommend.,1
Too many coats have to be applied to get the color. I was disappointed when I had to keep reappling. Polish is very thin.,0
The sponge is ok-but EXTREMELY small especially for the money. I would not buy it again.,0
very good,1
"Perfect ""just got back from vacation"" bronzer. & I love how light it feels on my skin not cakey or matted.",1
very disappointed that when I received my spray half of it had spilled out into the bag because the top was not screwed on properly,0
Ordered a ceramic curling iron after my metal one burnt my hair! I feel much safer using the tourmaline. My only complaint is the cord keeps getting tangled; it's very annoying.,1
It made me stop biting my nails.. but my nails are still weak.. I've been using it for almost 2 months.... But it doesn't really work..,0
"I've bought other sparkly nail polishes before and have not been thrilled with them. You have to use many coats to get the desired look you want.
I was very impressed with this polish when I only had to use TWO coats and it's PERFECT! It's pink, it's sparkly, its absolutely stunning! It's worth every penny! I will definiately be buying more polishes from Smith and Cult.",1
This is a review of the packaging which was awful. Just recieved and this conditioner was spilled all over the place. Severly disappointed.,0
"Make sure you read the size label.  They should call this a TRIAL or TRAVEL size.  It is about 1.5"" tall, if that.
The package it came in was ridiculous (that's an Amazon thing).  The dark brown is nearly black.  It's a little too dark for me, even though my hair is ""dark brown"".  It might work great, but I have to play with it a little more.",0
Writes review earlier,1
Didn't work well at all and snapped in half after very little use.,0
good,1
I bought two of these for gifts. They were greatly appreciated as it is a favorite of both of the recipients.,1
"SAVE YOUR MONEY! PIECE OF CRAP! DOES NOT DO IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM WHAT IT IS ADVERTISED TO DO!! LIVE AND LEARN, I SHOULD KNOW BETTER THEN TO PURCHASE ANY PRODUCT OFF A TV INFOMERCIAL! AMAZON IN NO WAY HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS EXPIERENCE, I BOUGHT IT OFF THE INFOMERCIAL! SHAME ON ME! I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO ATTEMPT TO GET MY MONEY BACK AFTER WHAT I HAVE READ FROM OTHER CONSUMERS, I TRASHED IT! BYE BYE $100.00!!!!!",0
"Terrible shampoo for the price, was very disappointed.",0
Bought 2 and both pumps don't work!,0
I had to throw it out as it provided no moisture for my hair,0
"The skincare specialist I see for facials recommended this product.  It is amazing.  I have always had very dry skin and thought I was doing what I should for it, but I wasn't.  My skin is 100% better after using this and the moisturizer.",1
Unbelievable hold but a bit too shiny for my taste.,1
"Waste of money,  doesn't look natural.",0
"Purchased from SkinCareRX. I took photos for myself before using this product and again after. They were closeups at multiple angles. I took new ones yesterday and since using this product, fine lines have TRIPLED. Literally, there are 3 deep lines under my eye, where there used to be 1.

I don't know why it didn't work for me or why my skin reacted this way, but I'm very disappointed. I would request a refund if it had been within 30 days, but I started using it in February (seven months of continuous use).",0
"I tried to use this to style a pomp but it doesn't have a strong hold and my hair kept waving and folding over (I have thick wavy hair). What's worse, the more I fussed with it, it started clumping into little flakes that took a while to smooth out. Maybe it works for other people with different hair types but sadly the Cement didn't work for me. I prefer Layrite's Original Hi Hold Hi Sheen Pomade (comes in the brown tub and is orange) but my favorite pomade is by Reuzel, works like a charm every time all the time.",0
Love it!  Easy!  Just wish somehow it could magically do my hair a bit quicker.... but it's super easy.,1
Does as promised. Works well hides the spots easy to apply. Only issue for me is sometimes it rubs off or powder falls on forehead.,1
I thought I would try the gloss because I love the Stay All Day Lipstain but this product was just wet and very sticky. I couldn't really tell you if it lasts all day because I wiped it off immediately.,0
"Very dry clay pomade that works best for very short hair. I have stubborn hair that's just over an inch long on top and the pomade was difficult to work down towards the root. A very strong product, albeit a little sticky, but not right for me.",1
"I didn't find this to be very helpful at evening out the tanning lotion, as the ad claimed. My lotion still appeared streaky after application.",0
I've used this product for quite a while... recommended to me by my aesthetion . She recommends all the Jurlique products. Great product.,1
"Not impressed by this product, I used to be able to buy the natural coola sports sunscreen, very nice, but they done away with that, bumped up the SPF from 30 to 50, added chemicals, and joined the rank of just so so sunscreens.",0
Great perfume. The smell lasts a pretty long time. The price was also very good so I cannot complain. Overall great product.,1
"I had high hopes for this product, but after using it for several months I did not notice any tightening of the neck area.",0
It's supposed to be Patinum - but it's yellow!,0
"I really tried to match my skin tone with the swatch but it ended up not even close. Color aside the coverage is excellent. I have a deep boxcar acne scar on my back. It is very different in color from my normal skin tone. This product completely flattened out the discoloration. If it had been a good color match, this would have met my needs 100%.

I'd have to see the colors in person to make a better match. I was way off.",1
"Interesting.. my first post was removed... I have worn Sugar for YEARS and this is NOT the correct perfume. DO NOT BUY! You cannot dispense the product without removing the ball, the contents inside was of dark liquid, not sure exactly what it was. Read the reviews",0
Was cake and difficult to remove from hair... I threw it out!!,0
Didn't do anything!,0
Smudged on first try and every try after. I just want an eyeliner that will stay put and not transfer to to top of my eye! Ugh!,0
"No stars for this product , it's 100 percent fake ,the brush is cheap and poor quality , don't buy this product ,waste of your money",0
This product dispenser came defective I am unable to make cream come out pumped it like 100 times...nothing. I am reordering glad its prime and quick delivery. Giving it 1 because it came fast and this would not be posted otherwise.,0
"It is pricey, so one star down for that. But it is very, very good. AND it is packaged properly in a darkened container. So many Vitamin C's are sold in clear containers which damages the anti-oxidant chemicals.",1
I feel this product made absloutely no difference in the appearance of my hair.  Much less as it states to make my hair thicker.,0
really dissapointed.  i bought the shaving cream which is great but felt let down after this purchase first of all when first opened all the soap spilled right out because like water not visous enough. then with what remained did not kkep bumps or pimples awa and did not improve my shaving experience.  not the quality i expected.,0
"I loved the Stila all day brush brow applicator and thought that was what I was buying. The color is great, but it actually HURTS to apply it and it leaves my eyebrows red.",0
"The best silky smooth hair serum out there.  Just use a small little pump for even long hair.  Everytime I use this product and my straightener after, I get so many compliments on my hair.  They think it feels so soft and looks so shiny.",1
First and foremost this cream burns my whole eye area and is no age control crme....didn't send it back because it took 4 weeks to arrive and came from Israel.  Amazon should not support this product.,0
I have been using this product for years. Whatever is in these bottles is not the same product I receive when purchased direct from manufacture. This stuff that is in this bottle is thick and has a completely different smell from the product I received direct from manufacture. The formula has not been changed either. I'll let you decide what happened.,0
"For the many of us who truly enjoy shaving, these products are the next step up.",1
Refreshing. ,1
"Really like this and the sponge that came with. I have sensitive to combination skin. First time I used it felt amazing. Afterwards, it burns a little at first but then it goes away. Perhaps because my skin is sensitive and feels dry after I wash it (directions say to apply to clean skin). I've used it on my family and they feel a little burning sensation at first as well.

After washing my face off, it is a little red and sensitive but goes away. My skin feels very clean and refresh, smooth and soft afterwards. Don't know when I'll use it all though. There's SO much! and i don't believe it expires so it's fine. the sponge that comes with is a great exfoliator and scrubs anything dead or dirt on my skin away.",1
"Very good for coarse, dry hair. It makes it makes it feel soft and makes it smell very nice.",1
Expensive and little or no tanning results.,0
Solo venan dos botesitos en la caja y supuestamente son tres que tendran que venir,0
"It was exactly what I ordered and it's wonderful, it just came a day later than I was told it would,",1
Covers wonderfully and saves me embarrassment of my thin hair,1
"I have really nice skin. It's one of the things I admire and pride myself about my body. One day during finals week (I'm guessing excessive stress made this happen) but I got a pimple. It hurt so bad and was huge. When I do (rarely) get a pimple, you can barely see them because I treat them before and during its early emergence on my face. Somehow, I came across (Please don't publicly shame me when I say this) an Instagram post on Yahoo of a Kylie Jenner snapchat of how she treats her face for acne. Due to that snapchat and my desperation, I forked over $16 on this drying lotion. Why did I do that? This stuff just chemically burns the crap out of my face, left the area peeling, and left behind a dark case of hyper-pigmentation. My skin isn't even that sensitive. Never again will I buy something like this to put on my face. I'll stick to the basics that have always worked for me.

Here's what works for me if you're curious: I get almost all of this stuff on amazon
-A gentle cleanser (cetaphil or neutrogena)
-Oil cleansing every now and then (olive oil and castor oil with a few drops of Trader Joe's tea tree oil are my faves)
-ACV mixed with water as a toner or Burt's Bees tomato toner
-Tea tree oil and clean and clear's persa-gel ( to treat bumps and pimples )
**I've learned that if you really want to have nice skin, you have to protect it and keep it moisturized. Also keep your routine SIMPLE**
-Olay Total effects 7 in one SPF 30 or Olay Complete for Combination/Oily skin SPF 15 in the am (depends on the season)
-Olay Regenerist Night Cream in the pm or SR Luna Oil with SR Good Genes serum

(The only non-drug store things I use on my face are Sunday Riley's Luna Oil and Good Genes serum. They're pretty darn good!!! The Luna Oil also has certain antiseptic properties that help prevent acne! Crazy right?! It also makes my skin so soft! The serum is good for hyper-pigmentation and brightening skin. Both of them do many other things too! Sephora has a duo kit for $78. It was a birthday gift to myself! I work on campus! Don't judge! As a college student, I often times don't get as much sleep that I'm suppose to and I was afraid that it would start showing in my face even though the saying is ""Black don't crack"". I got this duo to help prevent premature aging. #wrinkles #bags #Crowsfeet #SayNoToFillers #SayNoToBotox #AgeGraciously)

***Side Note: I use to have really bad oily skin. In early high school, I would dry it out with acne astringents and skip out on moisturizer at night because I didn't want my face to be really oily. Eventually, I realized that my face was overproducing oils because of this behavior. The moment I started using gentle cleansers, oils, and moisturizers, the moment my skin realized it didn't need to drown itself in sebum. As I go through my day, I still do produce oil on my skin but it's not excessive. It's just a healthy amount to protect my face from the harsh environment and create a healthy glow. During the warmer months, I walk around with a pack of oil blotting sheets just in case.

I like this razor,1
"I bought this curling iron after reading reviews about how it produces long lasting curls in hair that doesn't hold curl very well. It came in the mail today and I whipped it out of the box and plugged it in, only to finishing curling my hair about half an hour later and being left with limp curls that fell out less than twenty minutes after that :[  Now I did notice right away while I was curling my hair that I could barely feel the heat on the iron itself, but I'm assuming that it is part of this curler's charm since I did burn my ear with it while styling and yes, it was indeed hot. I have very long hair, so I had to curl in sections, and I had the heat setting set high, I already had product in my hair to help keep it's shape AND sprayed hair spray afterwards. Now my hair is sort of wavy and there's small curls at the end, which is how my hair naturally looks as I have wavy hair. So, if you're hair doesn't hold curl, and isn't thin or fine, I'd recommend looking around else where before buying this curler.",0
I just started wet shaving with Proraso and a badger brush so i'm not sure what everything else is like. But so far I like the scent. It isn't overpowering. It's pleasant. You don't need much to produce a good lather with a badger brush. Though i'm still trying to figure out how to make the perfect lather. Goes on well. I've nicked myself a few times though. I don't think it's my technique. I never cut myself using the eucalyptus shaving cream from a different company. I find that it makes my skin feel slightly drier after the shave as compared to my last shaving cream. But maybe i'm doing something wrong. I'm still learning though.,1
Light spice scent which wears well though out the day.  The amount I paid through Amazon was $25 less than what I would pay elsewhere.  Very pleased with purchase.,1
I have been using this product everyday for 2 months now and will tell you it is a must have. It prevents sweat and odor after a day at work or the gym. It has became a part of my morning routine.,1
i like it it does what i need it to do,1
"Coverage isn't full enough unfortunately. I have some acne scars that still show with this foundation. It looks uneven and I've tried applying with my hands, beauty blender, and a foundation brush.",0
"I had bought a cheaper contour palette and wasn't happy with it. I decided to splurge and get this and it's much better.

The colors are good, probably best for medium to darker skin tones. I'm very pale right now and I use the light contour shade and it is plenty dark and pigmented. I will probably use the other two shades in the summer.

I like that one of the highlighters is shimmery and the other 2 are matte.

The contour is very pigmented and does not take a lot of product to show up. When I use too much, it is hard to blend and ends up looking dirty. A little goes a long way, which is a good thing since it will last a long time.

The 2 matte highlight shades could be a tad more pigmented... I don't see much difference between the 2 colors.

Overall a good product!",1
I really like this iron. the only problem is it is big which makes it hard to handle it. it doesn't make your hair curly. it gives nice loose curls. .love it!,1
"These products are reaaly perfect! it smells so good and after washing, my hair  shines  so bright like at the advertisement.
So i can say that i'm satisfied. Thanks",1
same product prescribed by my Derm,1
"It hasn't been too long since I started using this, but my upper eyelid got super swollen and irritated and I had to stop using for a week. I think after you sleep with it on in the morning you have to get ALL the residual formula off. I'm going to give it another try and will update.",0
Good product. The color is what the picture shows.,1
"My wife bought me one of these for Christmas. I like all of the other Art of Shaving products but can't put my stamp of approval on this one. After a month of use the hair started falling out. It's to the point where I have to pick hair off my face after I lather for a few minutes before I shave. Like I said, I don't have any problems with their other products but this one is definitely not worth spending the $60 on.",0
Makes my hair look FRIED and doesn't brighten or whiten my highlights at all. Beware!!! I think this is what we consumers of hair products are warned about...fake product in a real product bottle!,0
Nothing bad to say about the scent classic grown man fragrance I get shown a bunch of luv when I wear it,1
"probably my least liked Stilla product .  I love their lip stain - that stuff stays on forever but this stuff, vanishes instantly.  Had I bought it at a store with a return policy, it would have gone back.",0
"I read the reviews, and since they are mostly positive, I thought I'd give this lip stain a try. I bought ""Liquid Kiss,"" and though darker than the color as represented on the Vincent Longo website, at least as my monitor renders it, it is still lovely.

The Pros: lovely color, evenness of color easy to achieve, easy application, dries fast, does not get on teeth, no taste

The Cons: color gone very quickly (too quickly), makes lips very dry

I've worn this three different times, and all three times, the color was gone within an hour. No, I didn't eat or drink anything. Each time I wore it, I used different amounts of stain to achieve different depths of color, but how much I used did not matter: a little or a lot, it was gone in an hour. I also used lip gloss on top of it during one wearing (this lip stain really dries out the lips; it goes on cool, which suggests the presence of alcohol).

I want to love this lip stain; the ""Pros"" I listed above are the very things I'm looking for. But lasting so short a time just won't cut it for me. I'm a fix-up and go sort of person; I don't like high-maintenance make-up. I don't want to have to repeat applications throughout the day. Sure, after a meal, a touch-up is sometimes necessary, but this lip stain hardly makes it through the morning commute.

If you don't mind the need for possible hourly re-application, and if you have a gloss to help with the drying, then this might be the product for you. As I noted above, it's a great stain in many ways. It just doesn't last long enough to be practical for me.",0
"My order arrived very quickly, sooner than expected. This is the real deal and cheaper than buying at Macy's, Ulta, or even online on other fragrance websites. This is my favorite perfume!! It's a nice, playful, fresh, and mature smell!!",1
I have had nothing but problems with this polish. It's streaky no matter how many coats or how much Seche top coat I use. It's super pretty and makes me sad that the formula is so crappy.,0
Awesome I love it!!!! ,1
"PROS:  Great salon length cord and strong spring that holds hair very securely.

CONS:  The metal on this iron is NOT ceramic (though it comes up in a ceramic search...?)and not a ""smooth"" type metal.  It PULLS and TUGS at my hair as I pull it through to catch the very ends before I wrap it around the barrel.  It was actually painful to use.  :(",0
"Good price but fragrance is very weak, and does not smell the same as I got from younkers VERY disappointed in it -Paul Loitz",0
I did think that the product would be lighter.....I still like it very much!,1
love it ! cord gets in the way sometimes,1
"Very surprised that this water removed ALL of my makeup, even my mascara. It was soothing on my skin and I really liked the feel of it. I will never use regular water on my face again or eye makeup remover!!! If you see negative reviews, I do not understand why. I've been using skin products on my face for years, and this is one of the best ones I've ever used.",1
I won't be using this again because I hate the cloying odor.,0
So good for thin hair!,1
"I've been using this product for awhile now, and love it. But there was something wrong with the last bottle I got. It burned sometimes when I applied it (which I had before with other products but not this one) and it only lasted for 2 weeks. I'm ordering my next one elsewhere. I think this was a cheap imitation or something.",0
"Great color, always get complements.",1
"It seems as if it is working for me.  I notice a slight difference in the 2 weeks that I have been using it.  But on the bottle it says to use it for a month.  I have noticed, though that it makes my stretch marks more visible? I don't know if this could be caused by my tummy having more elasticity and firming because I am also working out, or from the product. However, it smells nice and is not sticky like I thought it would be.  Overall, it is a wonderful product and I would definately recommend it to anyone whose tummy was severly stretched during pregnancy!",1
This is the perfect eye shadow for anyone with allergies.  It's the only product I have found that does not irritate my eyes.,1
The product seem to work pretty well. I have noticed that my hair got thicker and grows very fast....I almost need a hair cut every 4 weeks now.,1
GREAT PRICE MUCH LOWER THAN RETAIL STORES,1
"I had high hopes for this shampoo - the reviews were good and it smelled wonderful when I first opened it.
However, this does nothing for my hair or scalp!

It doesn't clean my hair/scalp and leaves an odd, filmy-ness all over that almost feels like hardened oil.
I was very disappointed with this product and will not be purchasing again...",0
"This is amazing!!! it is so sparkly, i just love wearing it. you do have to wear some red polish underneath it and then apply the sparkle on top which is fine with me. It is beautiful, i just bought the green one as well.",1
VERY PRETTY COLOR! You do need a couple of coats to make it really have full opacity. its a pretty purple color.,1
"I didn't care for it.  Wanted to.  I still have found ""Shave Secret"", purchased at Walmart, to give me the best non-irritating shave.  That and shaving in a sauna after a good 15 minute sweat.",0
"The positive reviews must be paid for!! This stuff is atrocious, and turns to a very funny color on the scalp. It doesn't cover much at all, and the ""fibers"" become clumpy very easily... Im glad I got the smallest container, but still consider it 7$ down the drain. Big thumbs down.",0
"Upon first inspection, I'd say this is a well made razor. I've used it once so far and in comparison to my other razor (Parker 96R) using the same blade (Feather), doesn't give quite as close a shave. I'm not dissatisfied with it. I just won't be using it as my primary razor. I prefer the easy blade replacement of the butterfly mechanism than the three piece design of the Merkur. I've read the butterfly mechanism is prone to breakage, but since I've only had my Parker for a week, we'll see.

By the way, I didn't use the included blade (Merkur Super) because I suspect it isn't as sharp as the Feather blades. Most manufacturers don't include super sharp blades because I'd guess they don't want to scare their customers away with their first shave. Such was the case with my Parker. The included blade (Shark) didn't give me anywhere near as close a shave as the Feather! From what I've read, the Feather brand razors are the sharpest you can buy. You just have to be extra careful with them obviously.",1
Great product,1
Be careful this burned my face . Was horrible for days... Peeled and looked like chapped sunburn.. I used as directed but have sensitive skin,0
I looks like what I was hoping for; my trip is in September! Looks like good quality and good construction.,1
Great cream at about $20 a tube. Okay at best for $38!,0
"I like how the bottle says FREE TRIAL SAMPLE and I paid $$ for it... NOT... actually came highly recommended from a  friend, but i did not like how it made my hair feel, squeaky.. not for me",0
My first tube in the Diamond Dust.  Love it.,1
"I discovered the 48-hour Vichy deodorant for sensitive skin while traveling in Europe and it was terrific!  Unfortunately, it appears that product has been discontinued.  I tried this product instead but it's a very poor substitute.  It's sticky.  Vichy, if you're listening, please bring back the formulation in the 48-hour version!",0
"messy it gets all over the place, it ruined my carpet in dressing room.",0
"Typical L'Occitane high quality soap. Pleasant smell. Bar is smaller (l x w) thanmost L'Occitane products, but also thicker, so it is difficult to hold onto in the shower. Will not buy again (I drop it too often).",0
Jimmy Choo went very well with his chemistry. But it is  too hard to fine. It needs to be in some main department stores.,1
Came packaged perfectly and smells fresh. I share this scent with my boyfriend and I live the way it smells different on both of us,1
Best makeup setting spray ever. Blows UD's out of the water,1
This curler actually works on my hard to curl lashes. It also comes with lifetime replacement parts which I not as of yet needed.,1
Curls do not hold at all. I prefer Jose Eber's wand to this curling iron.,0
"On the first and second day I found no improvement but I thought I would just keep at it.  After the 5th day I was beginning to see results on my pores, they were beginning to shrink I also noticed that my skin felt smoother and brighter.  I really love this product and will probably reorder another one.  It is a little strong - if you have sensitive skin, use it gently for the first few days just to break it in to your skin.  It has done wonders for my skin!",1
Fast shipping and the conditioner did not weight down my hair. Love it!!. I will be ordering again.,1
"My friend uses this iron and her hair looks amazing and stays curled forever so I decided to order it because I wanted something with a bigger barrel. However, my hair wouldn't hold the curl for more than 30 mins :( I find that my curling wand is easier to use and holds the curl, so I've gone back to that.",0
In 2012 the price of this wonderful soap was $10 -- now it is $14!  So I've finally hit the wall and switched my brand.  Sorry to say but L'Occitane has become a rip-off.,0
Very pretty but the product was broken when I opened it.,0
"In a full size can the product is great, but the 1.3 oz size always arrives dried out.",0
"Has a weird, sweet, sneezy smell. if that makes any sense..",0
"THIS TOOTHPASTE IS VERY HARD TO GET OUT OF THE
TUBE AND HARD TO BRUSH BECAUSE IT CRUMBLES.
THE BEST IS THE MINT BECAUSE IT REALLY BUBBLES
AROUND YOUR TEETH AND MAKES THEM FEEL SO CLEAN.

CINNAMOIN IS TOO HARD. AND FOR THE MONEY, NOT WORTH
IT.",0
"The tobacco in this is quite nice, but it is overwhelmed by a bright, high pitched bergamot that induced headaches in me every time I burned it. The candle was lovely to look at and I wanted to enjoy it, but in the end I couldn't tolerate it and had to give it away. If you're sensitive to high pitched fragrances, you might want to skip this one.",0
Skin appears to be softer and has removed scaly spots in just a few weeks.  Lotion a bit sticky but not bad.,1
I have been using this product since 2006.. If you have sensitive skin this is for you.. I love Jane Iredale!!!!!!,1
"Meh. I don't think it is a waste of money but don't think I'd buy it again either. Just ""ok"" in my humble opinion. I think other shaving products are better and easier to apply in terms of staying power.",0
This is it - the best face sunscreen I have ever tried.,1
"I'd been wetshaving about a month and was ready to quit when I ordered this stuff as a last resort.  I'd been getting a lot of pulling and weepers with every blade I'd tried even though I swore my technique was acceptable for a beginner.  My face always ended up pretty smooth and there weren't any real cuts, it just always left my face feeling pretty beat up.  It turns out my lather from the hard soap I'd been using wasn't right.  Once I got the Proraso, it was super easy to whip up and it showed me what a proper lather was supposed to feel like.  Now I get way less irritation and weepers and shaving is much more enjoyable.  I can now use my hard soaps as well, now that I know what a proper lather looks and feels like.  I've still only found 2 blades so far really sharp enough to cut my tough but slow growing beard (Personna Lab and Gillette yellow pack) but I haven't quit yet and that's thank to Prorasso.

Onto the shaving cream itself, I followed the directions and use a 3/4"" long squeeze of the stuff either on the brush or into my bowl and a wet but shaken out brush and it whips up pretty quickly into enough cream for 3 passes and my beginner touch up passes.  The smell is pretty good, but kinda one-note to me.  Lubrication level is nice, it's not greasy at all but it's slick enough you can lightly retouch an area you just shaved.  Doesn't leave me dried out feeling afterwards and it washes of very easily.  Overall good stuff and hard to mess up.  All the shaving websites talk about this stuff and I think the reputation is well earned.  I'm sure it's not the best stuff in the world, but it is some of the cheapest and it's good enough that it could be the only thing you ever need.  When I'm done this tube I plan on trying one of the other flavors.",1
"I have struggled with moderate acne since I was a teenager, and even now in my 30s I still struggle with it. I am always on the lookout for products that can help control it. For the last six months, I've been using these toner pads, and I just have to say that I am incredibly pleased with them. My skin has never been so balanced and clear. I used to have a really pronounced oily T-zone, contrasted against dry cheeks, but with consistent use of this product, my oily T-zone and dry cheeks have both moved toward the balanced middle of the spectrum. My acne is also under control. I still have sporadic breakouts, but nothing like I used to experience. I purchase these faithfully every 30 days. Love this product!",1
I should have listened more closely to the negative reviews.  This hair dryer quit working on the hot setting after a few weeks.  Hot and Medium were the same temp. Amazon was a gem to work with.  But cannot recommend as others had same problem.  Obviously a switch thing.,0
Love this stuff!! Gotta be careful when buying online products could be fake or altered but this stuff is the real deal! Love Oribe!,1
not enough heat returned for credit,0
Great bronzer but shattered day 2,0
Son loved it!,1
Very hydrating without being greasy......it sinks right in.....can apply make up over it without it feeling heavy & layered,1
"Very very disappointed. The product must be good, I can't tell coz I used it just once and because the bottle was defective. It leaked in my purse and by the end of the day when I reached out in my purse to use it. It was empty . The whole bottle leaked and got emptied in my purse. Very very disappointed. What's the use of the product if the bottle itself is defective. I didn't even get a chance to use it. And yes it had the cap on when I put it in my purse.",0
"This is my first review ever on amazon and I felt like writing it just because this product is probably the worst product I've purchased in my life. I'm a regular user of Loreal Techni Art and I love it! One time when I was out of my regular gel/wax and I thought I should give a new brand a try. So I picked up this piece of **** at a supercuts store. I'll summarize the reasons I hated this product so much:
1) Super greasy.. Not only it won't go out the next day you wash your hair, but you also have to spend 5 minutes washing your hands after you use it. Ain't nobody got time for that (esp when you are running late to the office in the morning).
2) Makes your hair look like you have dandruff. Like a severe case. A couple friends actually went as far as saying ""Looks like you haven't washed your hair in a month.""
3) Expensive. You can get a lot of very good options for this price. I would not have cursed it so much if it was like $3.

2 Cents: Don't buy it ever.",0
"Supposedly Antioxidants are a must to slow down the aging process of skin. This was the most reasonably priced that had the suggestion ingredients. Been using it for a couple of years. Didn't give it 5 because I have no idea if it will make a dramatic difference, just going off of what actual research has shown.",1
I was very disappointed upon receiving my nail polis as it was 2/3 full.  1/3had already been used out of the bottle!!!! Not happy at all!,0
"If you aren't a fan of the powder-y formula Urban Decay uses, you probably won't be a big fan of this one either.
I've had to give away my lorac palettes because of the terrible pigmentation. one small swipe and there's powder flying everywhere; doesn't blend well at all, ends up looking like a muddy mess",0
"I used this for years but had to stop due to the fact it started causing sores on my head.
My daughter had to stop using it because she has gluten intolerance , they add gluten and made her head very red and sore
It's a shame they don't use better ingredients .",0
Good color. Nice Smell. Feels nice.,1
"This is not the new paraben free formulation as stated, they shipped me the old version. I am very displeased that I will be having to send this back and order from somewhere else.",0
"I purchased this product from Amazon and it arrived in January 2017.  I have loved the BaBylissPro brand but the product has only lasted one year. It turns off and on during use and is not a reliable flat iron.  I have ordered another one from Amazon to be delivered today at full price and hope it does not disappoint.  If so, Ill have to order elsewhere.",0
Makes hair sticky,0
"Does not match the same quality of product I've bought before - very sticky, as if the can was stored improperly.",0
"MontBlancs StarWalker mens eau de toilette is attractively packaged - as one would expect from Mont Blanc - and it has a pleasant light woody spicy scent.

My husband and I both like it because its light and not overpowering (as many mens colognes tend to be).  We both like the orange/bergamot notes.  I also like that the scent doesn't announce itself from across the room.  I have to be close to get a whiff and my husband likes that.

The scent is a mix of mandarin orange, bamboo and bergamot, with sandalwood, cedar and white musk middle notes, and base notes of nutmeg, ginger, amber and fir resin.  No, Im not the owner of a really really good nose; I researched the composition of the scent. And I also learned that the scent was originally marketed in 2005.

I do like the scent, but my internet travels indicate that savvy shoppers may want to shop around a bit, perhaps sample StarWalker, and, as always, check out prices.",1
You mix this with the toothpaste before brushing. The combination cleans my teeth better than any I have used. I just wished that it whitened better than it does.,1
The product is more oily than I expected but removes makeup from the brushes better than elf or Mary Kay by far and dries quickly,1
"Not at all what I expected. It's heavy. It makes my hair look dried out.  I used it twice.  Once to try it and then once again to make sure that I had given it a chance.  It is living in the cupboard, unused.  I'm sorry that I bought it. I thought the ion thing was supposed to be good. (The one at my gym (different brand) seems good. The reviews I read on this hair dryer were good.)  I could wait for it to get here.  Now I have a reminder of a stupid purchase.",0
I have used this product a few years ago and thought is was ok. But this time I find it too expensive and not very effective. Won't buy again.,0
Very good. Freshens you up!,1
"I used to use this when it was a combination of L-ascorbic acid and ascorbyl 2-glucoside (AA2G). Ever since they changed it to 20% ascorbic acid, the product seems to contain gas inside and is frothy. Upon first opening the bottlle,  air or gas escpaed (making a burping sound) and of course some of the product also burps out of the little bottle and so you have just lost some product. It only happens the first time you open the product.  I complaind to Obagi but they seemed like they didn't own the issue and told me to speak to the vendor of the product. New bottle...same thing.",0
I have been using Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo for 8 years and this bottle seems to be different.  I don't know if Paul Mitchell changed the contents or this distributor.  I want the old formula back.,0
"I purchased a St. Tropez mitt from Sephora and it lasted a long time. It was cheaper on amazon by about $1 so I ordered two, and they were a waste of money, after three uses the mitts fell apart - they rip completely at the seams. I thought maybe one was defective but when it happened with the second mitt I realized these were just bad quality and now I'm reading other peoples reviews and there mitts ripped too. Don't waste your money.",0
good,1
"I'm normally a fan of the more solid concealers in stick or pot form since I can get heavy controlled coverage with those to hide the deep dark circles I've been getting under my eyes for the last year or two.  This was the first liquid concealer I've tried in a very long time that didn't become virtually translucent after patting it onto the spots I'm trying to hide.  It stayed nice and opaque and even after dabbing my liquid foundation over it, kept a nice bright base.  I was really pleasantly surprised by the results and since it is so smooth and creamy, I don't worry as much about tugging at that delicate under eye area to get coverage.",1
"Clear, runny, different texture, with no fragrance at all. Did not perform like the CHI I've been using for about 10 years. Very unhappy with this purchase, suspect it is fake.",0
"This product goes a long way, so it doesn't take much. I like the way it works. It was a little heavy on my hair and I don't care for the smell. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.",1
"I purchased this from my local salon; not from Amazon, and this is not the product that I remember. The fragrance is different; but more importantly the hold simply is no longer there. I began using this in the mid 1980's; and one round of spray held my hair all day, even in humid weather, it lived up to it's name, your style was frozen in place, no need to re-apply throughout the day. I just sprayed my hair, giving it time to dry, and I can run my fingers throughout, nothing ""Frozen"" in this product, it certainly doesn't live up to its name or reputation. Will not purchase again if doing so from a salon makes no difference, it's just good money wasted.",0
"Super disappointed with this iron. The clamp is so tight that it leaves indentions in your hair and you're unable to get a smooth curl. Also, it can't seem to curl the top of your hair - just the bottom (I have short hair so it shouldn't have a problem curling from top to bottom). I've had better luck with cheaper brands from the drugstore. Also beware when purchasing as they do not allow returns on this. Which is extra disappointing bc I bought it would be eligible for returns since it was a prime item.",0
It doesn't work on me at all,0
"I really don't like glitter nail polish. This nail polish doesn't look glitter at all in the pictures, both here at Amazon and OPI's website. I was disappointed when I got the nail polish. Way too glitter for me, AND it's much darker than in the picture too.",0
"I did order the wrong product.
But I  also sent back the box of my handheld as well as a cap so that I  could be given the opportunity  to read order.
There has been no response  what so ever and now I  cannot order the product I  need?",0
"I've been using the proraso line for a while now, they pretty much only make the one cream and a couple others similar to it but yeah, I really like how it makes my face feel after a shave and also how it is so quick to lather up with even a halfway decent brush.

I like the tubes of cream more because they just seem to lather faster than most of the tubs of cream, those tend to need a little more work.",1
I am a fan of bliss products but I had never tried the items in this set before. The face wash smells great and exfoliates while not being too harsh. The peel wipes ( 5 included) treat age spots and rough areas. The day cream is lovely and not too heavy. It also has a wonderful scent that lingers pleasantly. In combination this is a terrific treat for winter skin. Highly recommended.,1
"Philosophy for men ""Amen"" shower gel smells like cardamom, a fragrance I like and find comforting.  I would not describe it as particularly masculine, or feminine for that matter.  Some years back I had some bath products from Crabtree and Evelyn's Naturals line which had a cardamom scent, but  which, sadly, have been discontinued.  I liked them quite a lot. I gave this to my husband because it is described as a masculine fragrance.  He, however, does not typically use shower gel.  He has tried a couple of others whhich I have gotten for him, and in general has not been very happy with them.  He wants soap to lather, and smell clean, and that is about it.  He sees anything else as unnecessary fuss.  our son has used shower gel for years and though he acts like he is neither here not there about it, will drop hints as he is running out (which he does alarmingly fast).  He, however, is away at college, so this one went to Dad, who is less excited about the entire concept.

My husband said he found it slick, ""silky"" and thought it did not lather very well.  Shower gels, in general, lather better with a bath pouf, but he had no interest in using one, at all ;)  He tried it as a shampoo, and was not impressed.  It seems that his comments would apply to just about any shower gel which is glycerine based.  He does not care for how it feels and finds it less easy to use. I know he does not like glyerine-based soaps in general, having gotten him one which was made up for father's day at my favorite bath boutique.  (He did not care for that one at all). We both like the fragrance of the ""Amen"" shower gel (and he may actually continue using this one).

My star rating is the result of a mixed reaction.  My husband does not like shower gels a lot, but we both like the fragrance of this product.  For those unfamiliar with cardamom, it is not what most people would think of as a traditional spice, that is, is does not smell like cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves.  The scent is not very strong, and one I personally find comforting.  I t6hink this is one I would find relaxing at the end of a long day.

Up to this point I have only purchased Philosophy products for my children, since most of their women's fragrances smell like dessert: frosting, cookie dough... My daughter likes them quite a lot.  While I am something of a fiend for fragranced shower gel I have not yet found one from Philosophy that I like.  They are all too sweet.  I find this one nice, more subtle (and more adult).  For those who like shower gel, this could be a 5 star product, depending on how you feel about cardamom.  I did not notice any other scent (thought it is described as a citrus).  My husband, who generally goes for  very basic bath products.  He likes the fragrance but not the gel.  All that said, I would recommend this for those who like shower gels.  The fragrance is nice, and somewhat  subtle.  It does not lather like soap, and is (in my opinion) better used with a washcloth or sponge.  A sponge or bath pouf will produce more lather.  Our star rating is based on both of us liking the fragrance, but my husband not caring for shower gels in general.",1
"I seldom write reviews, but in this instance I feel it warranted.
I purchased this product based on previous reviews and the ""fact"" that it has sandalwood in it.. if it does you can not discern it.. all you smell is the overpowering odor of camphor and menthol.. it is so strong my eyes burn from it.. Truly this is a terrible product.. It gets 2 stars because it did allow a slick shave with my Parker razor.. but it has been 30 minutes and a shower and my eyes are still irritated from the oils..
Not what I thought I was purchasing!",0
"I was hesitant to purchase this item.  I have had laser hair removal on my bikini area, under-arms and some unwanted facial hair.  I paid $200 per session for the treatments performed at my doctor's office by an RN.  I have light Asian skin and am worried about scarring.  I have had friends who have had laser burns.  I am pleasantly surprised by the Tria.  I haven't noticed the dramatic hair fall out and burning smell that I did when I had the professional treatments.  However, after 3 treatments spaced 2 weeks apart, some new areas seem to be permanently slowed, and my touch up areas have been successful.  The laser surface is not as large as the doctor's so it does take some patience.  If you have had expensive laser treatments before and want to touch up or do some small areas, you will be happy.  If you don't want to pay high salon prices and and have patience, you will be happy.  If you expect salon results in the same amount of time, you may want to read all the reviews and consider your expectations.  I would re-purchase in a hot second.",1
"Love this scent. It starts out fruity then gradually fades into warm amber and a lingering of pineapple throughout the day. Like a warm, sunny vacation somewhere exotic.",1
"Big fan of Baxter's products.  Smell is masculine, but certainly not overwhelming.  Stop using your girl's dove body wash and pick up a bar of this (she'll start stealing it from you).  I use this soap daily along with their shampoo, face wash, and clay pomade.",1
"This is a great second razor or a starter if just testing out wet shaving and don't want to lay out for a fancier razor.  I got this for travel so I don't mind the shorter handle and lighter weight.  It has great grip, is easy to clean and change the blade on. The finish and plating on mine looks better that the picture here.  It is smooth but not quite as heavy or high quality chrome plating as the Muhle R109 that I have as my daily shaver.  But that didn't stop me from getting a great shave.  I do better with Feather blades rather than Merkur, but everyone has a different favorite.  If you are curious, this is a great value and gives a good shave. For the price you can't go wrong.  Paired up with a small travel steel bowl and travel brush, this makes a great compact travel kit for less than $50 and it will probably last a lifetime.  If this is your starter, you will eventually enjoy shaving so much you will soon be looking at other models and makers to get a personal favorite. This is one of three that I own.  Two are Merkur and I like each for different reasons.  This one I would call my best all-rounder!",1
"Eh, usually this stuff is a miracle product to me (when I buy it from Ulta).... this was my first time buying from Amazon since Ulta stopped carrying it and it didn't seem to have the same miracle power it had for the past 2 years I'd been religiously using it.....",0
"Have very dry skin. This cream didn't absorb well, and seemed to just leave a greasy cover over my skin. Also, experienced slight burning and itchy sensation after applying. I stopped using after a week.",0
"Best stuff ever.  I'm an older woman that spent years out in the sun.  My skin was ruff and bump.  I could notice a difference in my skin after 1 week of using this product.  When you get out of the shower in the morning all you need is one pump fun in your hand, run it up your legs and arms and then go back and start working it into the skin.  I would highly recommend it, in fact I will be buying some for my mom and my daughter.  Never to late to start taking care of the skin you're in.",1
"I was excited to receive this after reading all the great reviews about it. I tried it and my curls were gorgeous at first, but after an hour they were barely wavy. At first I only used the TreSemme heat protectant spray, and later I tried hairspray and a curling mousse while using this curling iron at the hottest setting and holding it for 30 seconds on each curl. Even with all of that the curls wouldn't last more than an hour. This is my first curling iron so I can't say that it's worse or better than other curling irons...or maybe there's something wrong with my hair. I hope the rest of you have better luck!",0
"I like the smell... but it don't last long at all, maybe 2 hours. I don't think I have had a cologne that faded so quickly. For this reason I don't wear it everyday, at work or an all day event. It is good though while it sticks around.",1
"It's clumpy.  It doesn't glide onto lashes like the regular Lorac mascara. And, it doesn't have any lengthening properties like other fiber mascara I've used.",0
it was pretty cool little box  of stuff.,1
Very cheap nail polish. It chips very easily.,0
These are not the real deal!! These are fake. Do not waste your money like I did. You will be more satisfied just going to the mall to purchase them. Yes you save money here but these are crap brushes.,0
"Curl does not hold, not what is was advertised to be!!!!!  Do not waste your money!!!!",0
I love the product but I got a 12 oz.bottle but got a pump for a 4oz bottle,0
I'm sorry to say but this product was too old...it is very thick that you can not just get a little out of the jar...it is clumped so much...I will probably end up throwing it out rather than to take the time nd money to send it back..I can't use it...the other product i ordered was the spray and it is awesome...thank you.,0
Moist and creamy lipstick in a well designed slim case. The colors are complimentary to everyone's complexion. Low gloss sheen. I love the Airdale lip colors.,1
Didn't really work on my hair.,0
I have a sensitive nose and could not get past the scent of this shampoo.,0
I have oily and sensitive skin and I'm so bummed it made me break out. Covers nothing,0
good,1
"It is a pricey pencil, BUT it lasts long and stays put. Doesn't rub off easily as most. Worth tbe price. Sign up for ipsy.com and you may receive one in your bag. You get to "" pick"" your items that you want to try, based on user input and info.",1
product as expected,1
"It was late which was unfortunate but I was so very excited for it cane perfectly in tact, brush was huge though I wouldn't use it for highlighter application more along the lines of a setting powder brush maybe but overall happy with my purchase",1
I could not tolerate the taste. I cant even review whether it works because it tastes so nasty. Yuck!,0
"I have been really happy with this conditioner-  I first thought it was too light and I was surprised by the minty (tee tree) scent.  It does a good job and my hair has been much better since i started using these products-
I did buy the deep conditioner and use it about 1/week too.",1
"I returned this because it left my brushes dirty and yet I had already hit pan after cleaning about 5 face brushes and a handful of smaller ones. Not impressed at all, and I also hated the fragrance.",0
Not so great,0
"This stuff is awesome post shave, I hate shaving when I don't have this product with me.  Very cooling, refreshing, leaves the skin feeling cool and tight.",1
"This may help keep your already white teeth.......white, but it has absolutely no flavor.  Not my favorite whitening gum.",0
"The reason for my two star rating is the smell. It is unbearably strong so I will not reorder again. My husband is using it, just to get rid of it since he doesn't have allergies and sinus issues. If it wasn't for that problem, the product goes on smooth and absorbs well in the skin.",0
"If you lather up with a badger brush you have no excuse not to buy some of this stuff.  It's cheap, it lathers like a house on fire, and it's extremely refreshing without being overly mentholated.  You may enjoy it more in the warmer months than in the winter, but you should definitely pick it up and give it a try.",1
A use only 2 days ago... But is perfect to it...,1
"Love it, works as expected .",1
"I received samples of these from the Nuxe company when I ordered their expressions lines cream and I in general love Nuxe products but this serum didn't work at all as the sample products did, when i used the sample serum i noticed the difference in my skin the next morning, but this ive used up 3/4 of the bottle and i don't think it is doing anything for my skin. It did not diminish my freckles, or brighten my skin, plus the product had a strange consistency and different smell, it was more thicker then the sample product, the sample was more fresher and liquid-y but this may be I got a defective product.",0
I love this product... You can see a difference within a couple days.,1
Boycott Ahava if you care about human rights! Their products come from stolen Palestinian natural resources in the Occupied Territory of the Palestinian West Bank. [...],0
Arrived promptly and in good condition. The hair treatment doesn't leave my hair silky soft but rather coarse. Don't like it. I use it after my conditioner and follow up by a grean tea hair mask. Won't buy again.,0
I was able to use and it distributed decently.,1
Didnt work only made my skin worse. I suggest being careful about buying Mario badescu products!,0
"Be careful with this stuff... start VERY slowly if you choose to use it. I have had a horrible allergic reactions and two weeks later now I still have a rash all around my eyes that is dry, cracking, and painful. This stuff killed maybe like 5 layers of skin in a day. I don't consider that I have particularly sensitive skin either - never had any kind of problem like this before - but this experience has just been terrible.

I suspect my case may be somewhat unique but given that I see other people having similar problems I felt the need to write the review. I'd give this one a pass if I were you.",0
The tube was gone very quickly and i saw no difference at all. Maybe it takes more time but I saw a huge change with Perricone products in a short time. So I will not be buying this again unless I just have money to burn and want to give it more time. although as pricey as it is I could probably get laser treatments with what this costs over time...,0
Love this lotion! Smells so good and natural,1
Waste of time,0
I am COMPLETELY  ANNOYED  that this product arrived  without  ANY  protective seals WHATSOEVER!!  It could be filled with ANYTHING and be going under the Vichy brand.  I will NOT be buying future skincare products from Amazon..cost to send back...WHERE IS PRODUCT CONTROLl??.......Actually read reiews that this was a problem with this product---Should have listened!!,0
Made my skin break out worse than before :(,0
"This paste gets stuck and dry through the opening and you have to wash it out with hot water to prevent the clog.  The paste makes your hair dry and crackly feeling.  It has a good hold and small shine, but I think you can get that from any regular paste you would get at a local grocery store.  I say pass on this product.",0
"I bought this thinking it would help - I have thin hair, but a lot of it. I was not aware that thick was synonymous with heavy and sticky. Honestly I may as well have just put some Elmer's Glue on my head. I tried to return it and was told that all sales are final, but if I wanted to receive some styling advice, I could try to wash my hair and make it less greasy before putting the lotion on. Such advice was insulting, and incorrect, as that is exactly what I did each time I tried it, following the directions exactly.",0
Like this product!,1
Great product,1
Came with the box opened and seal off and it had obviously been opened and handled as the bottle was covered in hand prints and more than a little of the cologne was missing from the bottle. Disappointing since it was purchased to be part of my husbands valentines gift.,0
met my expectations,1
"This product is amazing.  My high-end hair dresser uses it on my hair, after the luxury shampoo and conditioners.  It is shiny, healthy and soft afterward.  I found the product here on Amazon for much less than at the salon.  It checked out to be the real deal: my hair dresser and her coworkers smelled it and tested it and gave it a thumbs up.  It's legit!",1
I have 2 8 year old girls who hate to have their hair brushed before school. The have long hair which they don't want cut either. I spray this product in on top and underneath while they are eating breakfast. When they are done a brush it and works great. Haven't found any other product that works this well.,1
This feels like it does nothing. The brush that came with my mia scrubs better then this. Doesn't make sense when this is suppose to be deep cleaning. Not happy,0
I think I got an old one? It wasn't saturating evenly on the tip and was difficult to apply - very disappointed for the price.,0
yellow color is veryyy pretty and nice tho the bitch smothers and takes hella long to dry like clay on ur nails real heavy,0
"There is no stinging sensation or even a feeling like its working at all. It feels like it normally would just using a toner. I've had many professional facials and peels and this product is not anything like it. Very disappointed, especially for the price. Would really like a refund.",0
"I was shocked at the chalky, not sleek, feel of this product and will never waste my money again on this.
I will stay using the Fekkai ""Salon Glaze"" - Clear Shine Rinse.",0
I just received the order and my Clarisonic Deep Pore Cleansing Brush Heads were not in there.  There was a little sample of Mustelea Hydra-stick!  A sample for $36.  BEWARE!  I will say Amazon has been great in working with me to receive a refund.,0
"This is styled as a three-step skin care regimen, and overall it is pretty good, but has one particularly great component.

FACE SOAP ($15 individually):  This is a nice soap, cleanses, doesn't overly foam, but after the rinse, you feel clean.  Nothing truly spectacular, and a number of face soaps will do this, but it is a nice face soap.  Four Stars.

TONER ($18 individually):  Nothing special.  It's a decent astringent, but nothing other than the color and a slight fragrance, there is nothing distinguishing about the toner.  Essentially, it's water, witch hazel, and some color and fragrance.  Not worth the price of $18 for the separate item.  Three Stars.

MOISTURIZER ($20 individually):  This is the standout.  I've tried a number of moisturizers, from drug store to specialty items, and this is one of the best.  There is no greasy feel, and it sinks into the skin quickly.  My skin feels softer for having used it.  Five Stars.

All told, the quality of the package is four stars, but as a package, it is more expensive than I would want.  As noted, the individual components are more expensive if bought separately, but at the end of the day, only the moisturizer is worthy of that individual price, and competitors make a less expensive, comparable quality product for face soap and astringent.

If you are looking for a gift, this is a nice package.  If you are looking for yourself, get the moisturizer from Batxer and get the other items elsewhere.",1
Same thing. Leaves way too much r side in your hair,0
"I love this flat iron , wider which keeps me from
Making to many sweeps across my hair.  I have very naturally curly hair and have fried it in the past with other irons.  This one is so so so much better.",1
As described delivered on time.,1
"Great but overpriced, the bottle is so small...",1
"Is my first time using this product and actually i have not notice any changes yet, but i cant say it doesn't work at all. I'll keep using it and we'll see the results.",1
False advertisement. Picture shows a 11 oz big bottle. Received a very tiny 3 oz bottle. Priced for a big bottle. Very unhappy with my order,0
I have only used this a couple of times but this works very well and is very concentrated as most of the Pureology line so it may be expensive but it last and most importantly .. It works.,1
"When I received this eye shadow, it looked pretty in the container, but for me, it is extremely dark to use as an all-over eye shadow.  It looks fairly good if you continue to use a highlight color under the brow and this in the crease.  I thought it would be a good all over color, but the colors become muddy looking when used all over the eye.  I was pretty disappointed with this product.",0
What I was looking for at a good price.,1
Love this product.  Leaves face feeling and looking rejuvenated.,1
I would not recommend.  I was not impressed with the contents.,0
Great. Doesn't make my skin itch. YEAH!!!!,1
Smells good burns slow !  Thats all you want from a Candle !,1
Must be old product.  Doesn't have the same smell or lasting effect at all,0
Sturdy and effective. Why pay more? I had a brand name one just like it that cost three times more. Not even as sturdy as this one.,1
"I have two life palettes (work and love life). I've been fairly happy with them. The color payoff is fair. It helps to have a good eye primer, and fallout is minimal. What I really like is the blush. I get a decent color payoff. I've used other blushes from BH cosmetics and the color payoff is greater but I have to use a very light hand to avoid looking like a clown. So the lack of payoff compared to BH is a bonus. As for reviews comparing to drugstore makeup is fair in regards to quality, but I must say if you buy four blushes, four eyeshadow quads from Loreal that would cost you about $56 dollars total. And that's four shadows to a quad and you get six with em plus lip gloss.

So if you are unsure to purchase a life palette well just think what you'd need to by at the drug store to accomplish a similar look.",1
Didn't work for me,0
Don't let this polish fool you.  The CND Vinylux doesn't work.  It won't last a week.  I had clips on my nails within two days.  I couldn't believe it.,0
"I didn't care for this product. I found the texture to be thin yet synthetic feeling. It sits on the skin and doesn't absorb  therefor leaving the feeling of a ""layer"" on my skin, which personally makes my skin feel dirty. The product comes in one color which was too light for my skin tone.
This product might be good for a person with normal skin. Mine is dry and I need more moisture. I recommend Anthelios 15 daily moisturizer",0
"I got this along with the cream cleanser for my daughter who's been dealing with eczema for almost 4 months now. Based on good reviews I got this, desperate to find the right cream. This cream does not do a better job than any of the other fragrance free creams. It's simply labeled for eczema and its pricey, but nothing effective.",0
"Lasted only 6 months. Then the low setting, the only setting I use, quit! Worthless now.",0
this box is amazing plus i have a credit,1
My hair dresser uses this and loves it so I had to give it a try and really like it.,1
"This product arrived quick and did
The job.  At first it seemed it may have been opened already-but since I have ordered other good products decided to
Keep it.  The product was great.",1
Great Product. My fiancee will love it.,1
It's not as good as my rimmel stay matte powder,0
Not crazy about the spray dry wax. I don't feel like it really helps my style at all.,0
I didn't like the smell. Won't purchase again,0
Makes me break out. I was clear until I got this product now my acne is back in full force.. oh well,0
A little orange coming out of the tube but blends pretty well and looks natural.  Good for what it is and that is a temporary tanner.,1
I bought this Babyliss In march and by September it wasn't working. One side just completely stopped getting hot. Which I get happens BUT there is NO way to return it. It has only a 30 day warranty? When you spend $100 on a product they really should back up the quality!,0
Like the color very much a bit thick consistency need to be warmed up for thin layer. One week pass no chips.  Overall happy customer,1
"Expensive nice watch it it eats hair ouch if you use it wrong read instructions. You can use only very sm amounts of hair at a time. It gets heavy
After 20 minutes. Have to hold it with both hands used it on my client with shorter hair works well. Better then a curling iron as. It works in both directions",1
So yummy smelling and packaged well.  The lid must not have been tightly shut as it leaked slightly.,1
Great hand cream.  I actually use it on my feet and recommended it to a friend for use on his knees.,1
"I work in home health care, living in the desert it gets very hot , sweaty. Staying dry is important to me being confident I smell fresh when seeing patients. This product does that.",1
"Although it has a light fragrance, it does what it says on the label. Goes on evenly and blends quickly. One tube lasts about four months.",1
DEFECTIVE YELLOW GOO SHOWED UP AT MY DOOR & NOW I HAVE TO GO RETURN IT WHEN THEY SHOULD JUST REPLACE IT.  WHAT A TOTAL WASTE OF MY TIME!,0
It is exactly what it says it is: a super slick shave cream.  Gives a good close shave without any nicks.  You do need more than the quarter-sized amount to reasonably cover your face.  Only downside is it smells sort of like a furniture polish.  Wash your face when your done shaving and any residue easily comes off.,1
I would give it zero stars if I could! This is knock off perfume. It doesn't last long at all (just about 2 min) Don't waste your money!,0
Great blow dryer!  Really helps with frizzies.,1
Does nothing for my oily skin. The powder is also neon yellow. Like highlighter yellow. It is translucent on the face but I feel like it should be mentioned that the color of the powder is yellow.,0
This product is about half gone and it doesn't work anymore. I suspect all the propellant leaked out. The cap is NOT plugged. I already tried that. This is the second one I have ordered. The first worked fine. I love the product itself. I would like the product replaced with another one please.,0
"Reuzel Blue is a good water based pomade, but I still feel like there are some better ones out there. It honestly just might be the thickness of my hair, but I was really having to use a lot of the pomade just to get it to stay in place for a while. Unfortunately it will dry completely out of my hair within a few hours. All in all it's not a bad product, I would just recommend it for someone with thinner hair. Smells great and the shine is awesome.",1
"I got both the Eternity and Obsession colognes.  Of the two, this is the lighter, airier scent.  These smaller bottles are a good idea too, because that giant canister of cologne on the dresser might take several years to use, and it will be a different animal as it ages, and probably not in a good way.  Smaller spritzes from smaller bottles, just the ticket.",1
"The bonnet is very flimsy and doesn't last long.  Too bad as the dryer is very good and compact.  If they make one with a decent bonnet, I'm there but this lasted about 6 uses and the bonnet broke off.",0
"I didn't purchase my Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo through amazon, but I wanted to share my experience, since I find amazon reviews helpful. The shampoo comes in a dark green bottle with a black pump. I feel like the container is nice and is attractive sitting in the shower. I have a short bob haircut and I only need one full pump to properly shampoo my hair. If I leave it on my scalp for a minute it begins to tingle in an amazing way. This is my favorite part of the shampooing experience with Paul Mitchells tea tree shampoo. I also used the tea tree conditioner afterward. My hair feels clean and bouncy once dry. I only give it a four, because I find this shampoo very expensive.",1
Great product but two bottles so far have stopped spraying soon after starting using them. Not sure why this happened and they are not able to be returned.,0
"I love T3 products, and these are good rollers. However, they are really too heavy to be contained by the included clips, and they get so hot hey burn the scalp. I have to put pieces of foam rubber under each. A lighter roller would be better with a better clip.",1
Curled my hair for 5 minutes and then my hair fell flat. Not worth it. I have an old ConAir curling iron that still does the job and my curls last two days.,0
"Many years ago I learned from a makeup artist that the best way to apply most foundations, and to cover-up one's skin imperfections, it was to apply it in layers. Letting each layers fully air dry before applying the next. I found out that the best way to apply this one is using my fingers, to smooth the cream over my skin. So, following that method I applied three layers of this Dermablend foundation. And while I like the smooth look of my skin, I could still see my freckles. And hiding those it was the main reason I ordered this foundation.

Anyway, this makeup lasts all day, and it feels really silky on my face, and the most important part is that it doesn't look sticky, or grassy. Also, it didn't smear my clothes, which is another thing that is a deal breaker with me when it comes to makeup foundations. Because all of this, I think this it's a good foundation, but it won't hide skin's imperfections.",1
"I use this as a bake and a setting powder, it does it all for me! Very nice product and I will be buying it again when I run out !",1
"Very nice shave soap.  Great smell nice and slick, easy to lather.  I use it in a bowl but for travel I would face lather nicely.  This is a great soap for beginners.",1
My husband loves his Aramis. I hope we will continue to be able to find it. Thank you so much,1
"Somebody must be color blind.  This polish is not deep burgundy, it is blood red even after 3 coats. Big disappointment.",0
"The product is exactly as described. It is a tinted, non-oily sunscreen. Because of the friendly ingredients, the sunscreen came out very watery (a bit too watery for my taste), but does glide on smoothly over my face. I felt like I needed to put more on due to the sheer coverage; however, the tint is wayy too dark to slather on more product. The reason this is a four star rating is because for tanner skinned people, this product would be perfect, however, I don't think I will be purchasing this sunscreen again.",1
"I will admit a lot of the fault is mine because women are constantly told a lot of their beauty lies in their hair, and when you lose it it is pretty horrifying so, I tend to fall for a lot of the gimmicks that I will help my self-esteem some. This isn't one of them. It looked like I had dirt on my head, and it is dull and wipes right off. It is NOTHING they say it is, and it is NOT cheap. Just another company scamming people out of money based on insecurities and I fell for it.",0
"The product works perfectly.  I put it in my hair and excess on my arms usually.  The mint smell is very pleasant and not overpowering.  It is very refreshing when its in your hair.  It helps style hair without putting actual product in.  Through out the day my hair feels nice and soft.  My scalp also feels really nice.  I bought the product because with change in weather my scalp was getting dry and it helps a lot.  My only downfall of the product is that when the lotion dries, it sometimes appears that I have dandruff.  Not a big deal, I still use it, but would be nice If it didn't look like i had skin flakes everywhere.",1
"nothing sensational, but it is better than products i've used",1
"Its smooth and feels good and has a mild nice fragrance but it has done nothing and I'm not surprised. Nothing is going to fix creapy necks. Wishful thinking is so expensive. Things that work best for me are specific  neck exercise to create bloodflow, stay away from prolonged sunshine , watch your posture and eat healthy fats...We're all different and we all will age but let's do it slowly!",0
love it..a bit expensive,1
"For the past few weeks I have used Vichy Normaderm Beautifying Anti-Acne Care every morning after washing with my normal facial cleanser. I've substituted Vichy for my usual routine of day cream and moisturizer. I love how smoothly Vichy goes on. It makes my skin feels silky smooth and is a fabulous base for my foundation. It has successfully controlled shine even though I regularly have oily areas.

Though I don't usually have major acne, I occasionally experience an outbreak. Since using Vichy Normaderm, I haven't broken out at all. I'm very pleased with the product and will probably buy it again in the future.",1
"I read reviews prior to buying the system that included reviews of the 'old' formula [basically any review prior to September, 2013]. I had fantastic results with the 'old' formula clearing up the problems that had begun only months previous on this aging skin [age 66].  A friend told me about the system, that her mother [my age range] was also using it, and both had their skin clear up within a week.  My skin had the same results with the 'old' formula.  Then I had to order my first refreshing foaming gel cleanser of the new formula.  Foaming is an understatement.  The gel is a thinner formula so spreads on palm of hand instead of remaining in a nice rounded dollop! I am not sure what my face has reacted to in the new formula but not only am I breaking out with individual spots but also a very fine overall tiny bumps across entire face.  I had saved a little of the old formula so switched back and within 3 days all was better.  Returned to new formula and problems again.  If the 'old' formula is still available, I would hope that it is advertised as such.",0
"Loved it, just wish it was a little less expensive",1
"Its cute for kids...but didn't expect it to break by a toddler so easily as its emphasized on ""flexible"".",0
Bulky width doesn't work well,0
"It works and it has a nice scent, but. . .

I wear a minimal amount of makeup.  Some mineral powder on my face and eyelids. Some non-waterproof crayon eye liner and wee bit of eyebrow pencil. No mascara.

It took four totally soaked cotton pads to remove my eye makeup. I usually use olive oil to remove my eye makeup.  It works well, cleans up quickly, but well, it's olive oil. I wanted to try and like something else.

I wasn't even sure the stuff was working at first. It seems so mild at cleaning. In spite of the mildness, my eyes stung, though the feeling dissipated quickly.

I used one more pad to clean my face, just to see how it did. It easily removed the mineral powder. I'm glad I tried this, because I could really tell how drying it was to my skin.

I will not use this product again.  The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because it does remove makeup, however slowly, and it's got a lovely subtle smell.  If you have oily skin and wear the most minimal makeup, it might be right for you. For me it's a fail.",0
"Not bad, it holds a little but better than American Crew forming cream, and a little less than the fiber. It is pliable and workable, I would have given it a 5 star review if it was more reworkable, I feel like once it is dry and in there it is hard to reshape and move around.",1
"I'm not sure this is a true Moroccan Oil product (it's possibly a bootleg).  However, it doesn't really matter to me as long as it works, and it did.  I have a dry scalp all the time and this worked instantly. I saturated my scalp, let it sit 20 minutes, shampooed and conditioned my hair, and that was that.  It has an earthy smell, but it's really not that bad in my opinion.  You wash it out, and it does not leave any residual odors.",1
Dries out my hair!,0
This gave my face a white cast...no matter how long I rubbed it in...the same result...white....I can't wear this outside..looks ridiculous...Complete waste of money....,0
"It's really gives nice and good smooth feeling when I shave.
I first found out about the product from MYHABIT.
I bought it from Amazon as I didn't want to buy a set.
Fully satisfied and will likely buy again.",1
Works really good!  Keeps my hair soft and shiny all day.,1
"This is the 3rd tube I have bought - I really like it.  I have hereditary circles and puffiness and this is the product that perks them up the best.  Also, I have to use artificial eye tears throughout the day and since it is waterproof, it stays on.

Do yourself a favour and try it!",1
Very moisturizing which I loved but the scent is too strong especially for a little baby it gave me an instant headache also when I received the package the box that the lotion was in was open however the seal hadn't been broken so I kept it but I wouldn't buy it again due to the strong scent,0
Stuff is horrible. I followed the directions exactly and it took less than 24 hours to start chipping off. Amazon could not accept a return due to policies about shipping chemicals but they issued me a refund anyway.,0
"They discontinued this great product and replaced it with another ""intense nourishing oil"" which is cheaper (20% shea extract) to produce.  YOU WILL NOT GET THE OLD PRODUCT (pictured) if you order.
I have not yet tried the new one to see if it compares.",0
"I don't typically post reviews on products that I buy, but I figure I should since I had such a negative experience. Some background: I have had hormonal acne since my early teens and continue to have it at 24 yrs old...not so fun! I also have pretty oily skin. I had tried apple cider vinegar, Retin A, Proactiv, Clinique acne products, Mary Kay-- you name it, and I've likely tried it. After not having success with any of the aforementioned, I was looking forward to trying Mario Badescu's kit, as the esthetician at Ulta recommended it and I saw good reviews for it. At first, the kit did seem to dry my skin out and clear my acne a bit, but after 2 or so weeks passed by, all hell broke loose on my forehead. I hadn't broken out as badly for 10 years or so. It was AWFUL! I tried to use the sulfur mask as suggested and tried to get clear skin. Once the first breakout had started to heal, I got ANOTHER one on my forehead! (side note: it is not typical for me to break out during ovulation as I did with this kit...just around menstruation.) So, into the trash went this kit. It really took a hit on my self esteem, and I wish I had never tried it. It might work for you, but it was terrible for me!",0
Covers Great!! but the color is too dark for me... I will order again but in a lighter shade. If you brush your hair a couple of times it will wear off. I was under the impression it will only come off when you wash your hair.,1
Love this lotion!!  Smells so good and feels good on my hands!,1
Beautiful color. This reads way more orange on me than it does in the bottle. If you have fairer skin it will likely read more red. The formula is very sheer however. You will definitely need two generous coats or three thin ones for opacity.,1
Nice,1
"I like the way it dries my hair. It gets very hots and dries fast. However, the black covering is peeling off the dryer and every time I dry my hair I have black pieces all over. What mess!! It is heavy too.",0
I like this CHI product and the way it works for my hair.  I also really like the smell of it.,1
"Overall I find this body wash to be about what I expected. It's a satisfying treat but nothing to make it a new absolute favorite. The wash itself is fine; it lathers and cleans like any wash I'm used to. The scent (grapefruit variety) is nice: gender-neutral, not too fruity or sweet, and more complex than what you'd usually pick up at the drugstore. It's not a particular favorite, but should have broad appeal. I really don't notice it once I'm out of the shower, though.

The bottle is attractive, and gives the impression of something you'd find in a nice hotel. The pump isn't especially convenient, though. I need about five pumps to produce enough lather for a whole wash; each pump is small so I don't feel it's a large amount, just an inconvenient process. You'll also be bent over if you don't have a shower ledge at a comfortable height. It needs to be resting on something since you'll need one hand to hold a sponge and another to work the pump top. All that to say, the packaging seems luxe, but I don't actually like it better than an average squeeze bottle.

This might be a good choice if you want something that looks extra fancy, or happen to know you LOVE one of the scents. Otherwise, it's nice but not remarkable.",1
This did not work for me . Sorry ,0
Just received only half the amount of the bottle I don't very happy for that just too lazy to return and complaining,0
Not the exact same color and claimed. Very disappointed because I order the same color from dermablend and it not what I gott this time.,0
"This is something I saw on the Today show and I thought I'd give it a try.

PROS:  Smells yummy, only need a little, yellow color supposedly off-sets any redness.

CONS: Thick, yellow tint didn't exactly hide redness, dark circles or pimples, product has a weird thick/pasty texture that didn't blend in easily, was just ""OK"" when it came to smoothing out large pores, I still found that I needed foundation, and the product is overpriced and overhyped.

Wouldn't buy it again. I'll just use Baby Skin or Age Rewind from Maybelline. Both are priced right (well under $10 apiece) and work just fine. Lesson learned.",0
"Compliments on my hair keep coming. All I have to do now is wash, comb and leave it to air dry. Never been able to do this before, always had to blow dry to be able to leave the house looking decent. It makes the hair look healthy, smooth and styled. Bare in mind that you have to use it for a while to see the benefits. I noticed the difference after about half the bottle.",1
"I bought this as a gift for my mom, who dyes her hair. From what she has said, it makes her hair feel great and she notices that it is shinier. Though I don't speak from personal experience, she couldn't be happier.",1
"Yeah, this stuff is good.  I wish the quantities were in sync with how much I use of each one though (the bar is nearly gone and there's still pleanty of face wash etc..",1
"I have been using this for about 6 weeks.  It's okay, but I don't think it works much better than other thickening products I've used.
My hair is baby fine, so It needs all the help I can give it to have body and this does help. I gave it a four because it is worth trying, but don't expect ""body perm body"".",1
Excellent product,1
Very good product!,1
"Used for 4 years and then it would not charge or come on.  Found a second one on QVC for $179.00.  Still overpriced for as long as it lasts!  It does work and I can tell when I haven't been using it.  Now there is one for the body and they should upgrade the facial one with a longer than 1 year warranty!
!",1
Two uses of this product and my face is red and bumpy. It doesn't hurt or itch but I look like I have hives on my face. I won't be trying anymore Strivectin products - I was hoping it would work for me.,0
Not good,0
it seems cheaply made for paying over $80 for this product. Doesn't really do more good than a $15 iron from wal mart. I really am NOT HAPPY with this purchase.,0
it is light coverage as indiacated. I personally like a little fuller coverage.,1
"This doesn't hurt my hair, but it doesn't provide any hold at all.  My hair is touchable after using it, but mostly because the style hasn't held in place, so this isn't good as a hairspray.  Bummer.",0
"Lighter than my Solano, makes my hair really smooth and soft and drying time is less. XL cord is great.",1
This is like my 4 jar...my skin has alot of acne mark from teenage areas... its quick 5 min...but if u want to see noticeable result use it 3 times a week...i get compliments of having glowing skin without using any makeup or moisturizer...,1
"I think this is counterfeit.  The label is completely different than any other OPI bottle I've seen, but, more importantly, the color is not ""bubble bath"".  It is much pinker and I've compared it to fresh, unopened bottles at other retailers as well as opened bottles at salons.  Buyer beware!!!",0
"I have blond hair that is very thin, and if I do not wash it everyday, it gets GREASY. I use this shampoo as a quick fix if I am headed off to the gym or errands but I don't want to wash my hair beforehand. While it does not substitute against an actual shampoo and blow dry, it definitely makes my hair look better then nothing at all. I would recommend it as long as you aren't expecting this to take the place of real hair washing.",1
Wife loves it!,1
"Works very well. The color is a little off, but if I blend it in with a fingertip, it works.",1
"Purchased this model based on the ""Low EMF"" claims, but upon testing, the output exceeding a regular hair dryer.  When the company was approached about the incorrect ""Low EMF"" claims, it was shrugged off and reported that the claim was in comparison to a professional hair dryer. If you are considering this based on the ""Low EMF"" sales point, keep looking elsewhere....",0
I really wanted to love this for my curly/wavy but fine hair. I love their moisture cream but this made my hair flat and puffy. Killed the definition of my curls completely. It does smell nice though,0
"I first heard of this product when my hair stylist used it on me during a hair cut and hi-light. I noticed that it really made my hair behave well without giving it that greased down look which is hard to do with my hair. The fact that my stylist uses it impressed me too, they deal with hair all day and they know their products. I went and bought some and have been very happy with it ever since. It smells great, although it does have a ""man's cologne"" essence. My hair feels soft and smooth and never greasy and weighed down like with other things I have bought. It also gives my hair a nice shine.",1
"When I received this product, it was cracked into a bunch of pieces. I ended up getting a Sephora brand nail file instead and it feels much sturdier.",0
"Not what I thought it would be at all.  I was hoping for something I could spray into wet hair and go, which you can, but it leaves it stiff and crunchy, like a gel.  I was hoping for a product more like Oribe's curl gloss, but cheaper.  This is not it.",0
It came damage,0
"This product is very good just like all the Morocconoil products, if there was just one observation, it is that
you have to put very, very Little, if not you hair will go flat, however, it will always look shinny.
Like this very much. Just be careful.",1
This medium is lighter than what I purchased at Macys,0
"This is a good way to sample several different scents.  They all have tiny plastic stoppers, which are pretty tricky to remove, under the caps.  Since the stoppers are so aggravating, I thought/hoped maybe I could just leave the stoppers off and just put the caps on without it evaporating.  But you CAN'T!  It started evaporating pretty quickly.  So, I'm back to removing a stopper each time I wear any of them.  No real big deal.  Overall, they're really nice, and the little bottles are cute!!",1
I previously had bought this product at my salon for almost 3 times what I paid for on Amazon...product is wonderful for my hair.,1
Out look is good but I didn't like it's smell,0
It only lasted three days on me. I thought it was going to last a week but it didn't. Will not be buying it again. Not worth the price.,0
"I feel like I'm wearing a peacock on my nails and I LOVE IT!  The polish dries super hard and a little rough due to the glitter.  You can leave it as is for a textured look, or top it off with a nice thick clear coat for a beautiful glossy finish.  I always use a minimum of 2 coats of color, but you could almost get away with one coat on this one if you were in a hurry.  Zoya makes great products.  love LOVE love!!",1
Exactly what I wanted,1
"Wanted to love these but actually glad I hate them because they are pricey. Granted, I have a pretty sensitive nose, but the smell of these is just awful and I can't wait until I run out of these. Way too strong-scented.",0
I used it up quickly but overall it was good.,1
nice feel,1
"Smelled odd, cap came cracked so did not stay on the bottom portion, not very moisturizing (much more waxy than oily if that makes sense). WOuld not recommend.",0
"First one I received, the blue inner portion was not secured and fell out while blowdrying. Hot!!
I reported to amazon and they sent me a replacement that works well. Really dries my wavy hair quickly and with controlled curl (with a combo of my aveda products).",1
"I thought I was purchasing the 1.06 oz powder, but it was the aerosol. It works well though.",1
"Great neutral, every day color for a professional.",1
"Really great quality, easy to apply (so long as you have the right brush for brows) fast shipping, and the color is pretty good... I read another review saying the colors show up much darker so I ordered light brown for my dark hair color- don't trust that!  The colors are pretty accurate, so I'm ordering a dark brown to match my eyebrow color.",1
"Exactly what I was looking for.  The color is fantastic.
Wish they would continue to produce this shade.",1
"the first time something like this happened to me. This is not what I ordered. I know very well Lacoste Pour Femme fragrance. is any water and alcohol! additional problem that I can not give up. I would like to get what I paid for it or the original perfume or your money back.
jerzy",0
"Great form factor, wonderful applicator tip, but formula is watery with horrible coverage. I would not buy this product again.",0
"This shade is so gorgeous! It's the perfect champagne gold. I always use this one my inner corners as a highlight topper.
I would recommend this for any skin tones!",1
"Pretty, stylish color. I like Essie polish, but it does chip a little bit. Very good price.",1
Watch the return policy with Crabtree and Evelyn. They don't back up their products. Worst customer service for a defective product in years for me.,0
CND glacial mist is a pretty wintery light blue with big pieces of glitter!! It's a little thick because of the glitter so I recommend sitting the bottle in a dish of hot water so it spreads easier.,1
"Did not do anything, no change what so ever. And the bottle pump stopped working",0
The best product ever for kids! Easy to use bottle & dispenser.,1
This product was great  it got rid of my babies really bad cradle cap after only one washing.,1
"Anytime I purchase an item online I read its reviews first. The thing I hate the most is that some product/service reviews are not written by its actual consumers. I'm here to tell you I am 110% the buyer of this product and Love It! I have fine flat hair and have never come across a product that actually lasts all day. It is amazing. I will say this, once you put it in your hair, it has a really strange feel to the touch, but by looking you cannot even tell you have product in. Hope this review helps you!",1
I got this for my sister and she absolutely loves it! The colors are just plain amazing! I gave it a four star rating because she was kinda upset that we received the palette kind of dirty.,1
I've seen no difference between this product and Revlon's top coat. Plus Revlon is half the cost.,0
It really helps oil control through out the day!,1
"This is the only face cream I use. For the price, it's worth it as the jar will last up to 6 -7 months. you only need to use it sparingly. I do like the light scent of fresh ""balsam""... that s probebly not the scent but its a soothing spa fragrance.",1
"My son loved this cologne  it sat perfectly
On his skin , loved it will purchase  again and again... Thank you",1
As described.,1
Just a tad bit watery. It works pretty good but needs to be a tad thicker. The product does have a delightful smell.,1
"Doesn't work. Product constantly separates in container, yet instructions says not to shake.",0
"I've been a solid Cargo user for 5-6 years now. I switched from Clinique as I felt that base was too heavy. I couldn't be happier with this one it's light weight with excellent coverage, goes on smoothly, has SPF, and very gentle for my oily skin. I don't think I'll ever switch!",1
"I have fine, dry, somewhat frizzy hair, this was not the product for me. I got out of the shower and with my hair still damp, put in a small amount of product on my hands and worked it throughout my hair and ends, I blow dried it and then used the hair straightener.

My hair was so incredibly oily that it stuck together, it was horrible! I actually had to wash my hair again to get rid of the product.

I will NEVER use it again while Im wearing my hair down,  so it does not go to waste, I now use it only when Im going to be wearing a bun all day.

I rather have a bit of frizz than greasy looking hair, yuck!

Only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because it smells pretty good.",0
"I was really hoping to like this. It has great reviews, but it made me break out. My skin is normally very clear and problem free, but this isn't the sunscreen for me.",0
Been using this clay for awhile now.  Works great with a nice matte finish.,1
"For those with oily/combo skin this is the perfect moisturizer for NYC summers, or any hot and humid climate. This is literally the ONLY moisturizer I can use in the summer alone, or under foundation that doesn't make me look as though I've washed my face with bacon grease. I'm giving it 4 stars because I do experience a slight burning when wearing it, especially after washing my face with the La Roche- Posay Purifying Foam Cleanser. I also find that it's not the most effective for colder, dryer months. This past winter I've been added a little bit of vitamin E oil to the moisturizer and it's helped combat dryness and reduce redness/burning so perhaps this product just needs more vitamin e. Overall, because of the burning sensation I can't wholeheartedly recommend this to those with sensitive skin, but if you have oily skin I would definitely suggest giving this product a try. I'll definitely be re-purchasing since summer is right around the corner.

EDIT: after going two weeks without this moisturizer i noticed my skin has been going CRAZY. i never realized how much this controlled my oily skin until i stopped using it. like they say, you never miss it 'til it's gone... i'm still going to stand by my original 4 star rating because of the slight burning sensation but otherwise this moisturizer is going to be in my skincare arsenal forever!!!!!!",1
The only thing I didn't like is that they didn't tape down the actual pump to this bottle so the conditioner was all over the box and everything else in the box.,1
"Has helped a little, but how can you shake the product when the bottle is full?",0
"This was a referral from my stylist as he has had one for nine years that he uses daily.  So far, it's great and the idea of never having to buy another hair dryer is even better.",1
Nice feel but does not firm at all. I used the entire jar.,0
"I like that this product seems to last long and there is no weird taste; however, it is hard to get it out of the container.  How many times are you supposed to turn it?  Sometimes once, sometimes five times.  I have a nearly full tube right now that I can't get a significant amount out to apply enough to even see color, so I don't use it anymore.",0
works only for short hair and video is overrated.  I would not buy it again.  Length of hair makes it obvious,0
"I was a little worried about the color of this lip gloss, as I tend to wear more pinks than peaches, but this is a very wearable peach.  It goes on with a wash of color and shimmer, and adds a nice gloss.  I consider this more of a lip gloss than a lip treatment.  It's kind of sticky, like a gloss.  As a gloss, though, it's quite good, and quite wearable.  There's a fair bit in the tube, and I expect it will last for some time.",1
"This hairdryer gets hot, but doesn't have a powerful airflow at all. I have thick, wavy hair and it took forever to dry it even on the high heat setting. It came with everything it said it would, but when I tried to use a nozzle for styling, it popped off twice. Hair didn't straighten, ended up frizzier than normal. This is going back, not worth the money for me. Maybe it works better on thin straight hair.",0
"Beautiful color for summer or any time of year! I am very happy with purchase, I highly recommend the zoya brand because it wears well, Dillon and Thea  are both beautiful shades in this line!",1
Love it!!!!,1
"Smells really minty, strong smell but I like it, definitely stick with you, overall not that bad, as opposed to most tea tree products",0
This is not the real mod about you. i used it on my toes and used the gel on my fingers and the color from this polish is much darker than the actual color it should be. it's more of a pepto bismol pink than a pale pink. I ordered this about a month ago and just used it and am not happy about it.,0
"Upset!
 Got it and when i opened it as if someone had used it!!
 I know how full it should look an this was unacceptable!
 Will not but from this buyer again!",0
Used this for my sons baby acne and it cleared it up really fast!  Would recommend!,1
Tip didn't glide so well,0
"I am disappointed, I have the feeling it does not do anything, even though it is such a hyped product. Will not buy again.",0
Another excellent product that delivers from Paul Mitchell.,1
Love It!,1
So refreshing and it really moisturized my skin!,1
"I've used the super smooth shampoo in the past and was excited to see this in the larger size. It's not at all the same formula and even smells differently, like baby powder. I'm extremely disappointed and won't make the mistake of getting it again.",0
"I over plucked my eyebrows in High School and I've been trying to grow them in for over two years with no luck... until I discovered this product. Im on my third week using this every morning and night and my hair is finally growing back!! I really didn't expect this to work but I am very pleased. I will be buying a second one, its worth it. :)",1
"I was so excited when I got this yesterday, and I immediately plugged it in to try it out. I had the dial set at about 350ish. As soon as my hair touched it, it MELTED. Not singed. My hair literally melted to the iron. I changed the heat setting and the same thing happened. So I unplugged it, letting it cool down and then tried it again in half an hour or so. This time it didn't heat up at all. Wtf. So disappointed. I haven't decided yet if I'll try it again or get something completely different, I obviously got a faulty product.",0
"I don't know why all the reviews here are negative, but I am currently having a great experience with this product. I wear nail polish a lot so its really important that I use a base coat that protects my natural nails. The base coat is GREAT! It goes on as a matte finish and really hardens and protects my nails. Naturally, I do have long and hard nails so maybe thats my advantage, but still this product stands out. Also the top coat is just as amazing. Its been a week and my nails look like I got a gel manicure; its super shinny.",1
"It is not brand new, the product has gone rancid. It's scent is musty....very disappointing!!",0
"This product has Azeliac acid in it which is effective for rosacea. It is the first product I have been able to use in 6 months on my rashly face! After spending $400 in high-end skin care products, none of which my skin could tolerate, this goes on without any ill effects!
Unfortunately, I may need to send this back. The scent is overpowering for me and brings on sinus issues which signals the start of a migraine. If scents do not bother you, I feel you will be pleased with the results for your skin.
As soon as it arrived yesterday I tried a few drops on my face and it seemed to make a cystic zit disappear (WOW) and then it calmed the rash around my eyes and the rosacea red around nose.
I left the product on my face all night except for retin a area under eyes.
My ""acne area"" on chin actually feels somewhat oily this morning instead of scaly! (Did the Sesderma open up the pores?) This stuff is miraculous, I am thinking.
After a trip to my PCP yesterday for the red rash around my eyes, she has rx'd desonide cream ($240 which my insurance will not cover). So far, my doctors have simply prescribed cortisone cream. Cortisone has not solved my problem.
I will be using this serum each day regularly. I think this will solve my skin problems.",1
I used this after each shampoo for about two weeks. Didn't notice a difference. Smelled nice but otherwise a waste.,0
Leaves hair full and conditioned nicely. Love that it does not weigh down fine hair.,1
"I usually only purchase products with natural ingredients but I got a few free samples of this product and tried them out.  My skin visibly looked better after using this product.  So much so that I just had to buy it even if it's not completely natural.  I use it once per week and I can definitely see my skin is brighter, firmer and softer.  Highly recommend!",1
"This Scrub was simply horrible. I have a little bit of bumpy skin on my hips and butt, I bought this because of the rave reviews and I tried it out for an entire month. First, It did a great job of getting dead skin off. I liked the feeling of being super fresh. HOWEVER, I started to get KP all over my body! Suddenly I had KP going down to my legs and even arms. Visible large bumps that look like what you would get when you are cold. I never got that on my legs. Just my upper arms when cold. Using this scrub made it even worse. I decided to discontinue and slowly the bumps disappeared. I don't know if this is a personal way my body reacted or this scrub gives you more of the problem. I have a full tub just sitting in my apartment and I am going to have to throw it away. I cannot believe how expensive it was but all it did was give me KP. I would suggest not buying this product at all or simply trying it on a small area and seeing how your body reacts first. Keep those return labels handy.

PS. It came with some lotion, I dared not use it. I don't trust this company with my skin care at all.",0
"I read all the reviews I could find before purchasing this product and carefully watched the DVD before using for the first time.  I only tried it for a few minutes, but as it was actually painful I stopped.  Unfortunately I did not stop soon enough (once the PMD actually gets suction it's quite hard to control), and my face looked as if it had been attacked by an angry cat, with long scratches and welts on both sides of my face.  I'm returning this asap - buyer beware...",0
"This mascara does what I need it to. I was having no success in preventing ""raccoon eyes"" by mid-day despite using waterproof mascara, powder under my eyes, etc. This product does as it promises and does not smudge under the eye. I even fell asleep with it on once and still no smudges the next day. It comes off easily as advertised too. My only problem with it is it is difficult to apply without getting it on the lid at the base of the lashes. It is by design a very wet product meant to coat the lashes. Others may have no trouble with this but my lashes not very thick and I have to be really careful. I ordered the white primer so will see if this helps. In any case I will stick with this product due to its ability not to smudge under the eye.",1
Not what I expefted at all.,0
"Works well, no problems.",1
Love,1
I went to the salon and they used this styling cream and fell in love with it . when i went back they discontinued it.. i was like geesh. but the vendor has it . very light and manages the hair great.,1
My newborn has started breaking out with milia in his 3rd week and I bought this product to give it a try. It seems like it made it worse on his face. He doesn't seem bothered by it. Sometimes things get worse before they get better so I'll try it a little while longer and see. I hope to get the same results as the mothers who shared their photos!,0
"I realize that these are samples, however, the tiny packages are just for one use. I cannot determine if I like a product with just one use. This was a waste of money.",0
Good price and nicely packaged to insure  no leaks,1
I love this product. The only reason I've deducted a star is that it's rather pricey for the size. The full sized product is more like a travel sized sample.,1
"I agree with the other reviewers who state this is thick and not as good as other CND Shellac polishes.  Where I'm a huge fan of the whole Shellac system, this color is really thick, hard to apply thinly and shows the brush strokes after curing.  It still holds the great shine and long lasting benefits of Shellac but I'm just not a fan.  Also, the color doesn't seem to suit my skin tone very well.  I'm pretty fair and the color seems to blend into my skin, so it looks kinda funky.  I'll be giving this to a friend...",0
Works to brighten my teeth.  This product has shown to be beneficial for my yellowing teeth. I have been using this product for over 5 years and I am happy with the results.,1
I have been very happy with the iS skin serums  and so am expanding out with this complex.  Great packaging.  As I travel and take lots of little of bottles.  This is perfect.,1
This product did nothing to improve the look of my skin. I used it twice a day without any noticeably difference. The AVON products I have been using work so much better. Suzy L,0
"I bought this product because my best friend recommended it since it gave her hair great volume.  It took a few tries and some youtube videos to figure out how best to utilize this curling iron.  First and foremost, if you're looking for great big cascading fall down curls, get that notion out of your head.  I have fine, thin hair but I have a lot of it.  I use this as a volumizer rather than a curling to ""curl"" iron.  I start from the end tip of my hair turn the curling iron parallel to the floor then slowly curl up to the root of my hair.  Its basically like curling your hair from the bottom to the top as if putting in a hot roller.  For me, thats the best method to use this iron.  And I get the most beautiful bouncy voluminous hair because of it.  This iron does minimal damage to your hair, it doesn't snag, stays hot at the temperature you set it on, and its got a swivel cord bottom so it will rotate as you rotate the curler around your head.  If you're looking for nice natural curls, buy a curling iron with a smaller diameter.  I have the 1 1/4"" and I have this and I love them both.",1
I can't get it close enough to the base of the lashes to get the curl right.  I trashed it.,0
not as pigmented but it still does the trick,0
Smells bad.. too much effort to return,0
"I thought that buying the cheaper 1 oz. spray would help me decide if I liked the product enough to buy the more expensive 5 oz. option.  Unfortunately, I could not get enough out of it to be able to tell.  I probably used it about 4 times (I have pretty short hair, so not as much coverage needed) before it was completely empty, and of those 4 times, it really didn't seem like much of the product was actually spraying out.  I couldn't tell if it was an issue with the spray can or if that's just the way the product was intended to be.  Because I love my other Amika hair products, I decided that I would give it another shot and try the 5 oz. in the hopes that it was just an issue with the smaller spray can.  Other reviews have stated the same thing, but I'll say it again - Don't waste your money on this!",0
The Lip Balm has a pleasant smell. It is a great way to moisturize and protect lips from the sun. I recommend this product to family and friends.,1
"Great product, I feel like my skin has definitely improved since using them.  I do cut them in half because they are rather large wipes.",1
I love this color but the consistency is very watery.. My nail girl commented on that.  I don't know if it's because it's a vegan product or what but my nail girl had to put three coats on that dried very quickly upon application.  Drying quickly is basically good.  There was also no shine when it dried.  One or Two coats didn't give the color in the bottle.. I have mixed emotions about this product.  I highly doubt I'll purchase again at that price tag!,0
"Good sunscreen, great sent, but a little greasy.",1
I have been using this thing for a few months now. It certainly feels good but I can't say that it has helped improve my skin at all. I wish I had not spent the money. It does hold its charge for quite awhile.,0
"This has great color, but the color is gone in 10 or 15 minutes.",1
"I think this is a great product and the smell is amazing, but when I got the bottle I ordered from amazon it had a crack in it and it all leaked out. I would suggest buying it in store...",0
they break very easily and they burned my fingers and scalp.,0
"I think I have been using it for 2 months or so. Definitely my lashes have become longer. Unfortunately, I wish they also become thicker. If they did then not tremendously.",1
"i love this pomade, strong hold. not so shiny.
but shipping was terrible. in side box there was no shock prevention packing.",0
"Not for curly, wavy hair.  Maybe if you have fine hair??  I didn't like it as it caused my hair to become frizzy- uhhh yuck!
so my search continues.",0
"I didn't use it right away. Instead of it spraying, it sort of shots a tiny stream. Cant return it because window closed already due to the fact that I didn't use it right away.",0
"Total waste of money, you can not sharpen it!! breaks off total rip off",0
"Cool name. Nice handle. That's about it.

I wanted to try this (after my Conair BC171NCS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush's heating element stopped working after a year) since it was the highest rated product of its kind on Amazon but I was REALLY DISAPPOINTED.

I didn't really consider wattage when purchasing this but its ""Powerful 250 Watt"" is actually laughably puny next to the 1000 Watt Conair Hot Air Brush.

I also didn't like how easily it got stuck when I rolled it up in my hair. I think it's due to the unforgiving hard plastic bristles, compared to the Conair's flexible bristles.

Sending it back and going to try another Conair brush, which comes with THREE attachments and the Helen of Troy came with none.",0
great color and lasts fairly well.,1
Excellent. I've tried a lot of different ones out there and look forward to running out of those so I can only use this one in the future.,1
I love Coola.  I did not like the matte finish on this particular one. I prefer a dewy finish.,0
haven't received proper item,0
I have tried a few others but this cream style lather is the best of its kind. there is a competitor which gets many 5 star reviews on this site but I've tried both an my face is always smother after using Jack Black's.,1
"Difficult to say how this smells, kind of earthy and woodsy, but my understanding is it smells different on everyone. Have yet to have anyone comment on it, so I'm unsure of it's effect.",1
"This is a REALLY oily, thick face cream.  Unless this is what you want, order the balancing day cream.  I made a mistake and ordered this instead.",0
"Terrible, doesnt work
Bought the medium and used it at night, saw no results, then i started using twice a day and still no results
Only thing that turned color a little was my cuticles and dead skin around my nails
Cant even return, what a waste of $$
Maybe its my skin type or something, im very fair skinned, so i was even scared to get too dark, but again, no results!!!",0
"Nice the best hair gel,  my hair does not move no matter how windy",1
"It was good
Thank you.",1
"It's always good to have it, have been using Li long time",1
"I purchased this product because of the good reviews. It was fine in the beginning but I did notice it soaked in a lot of the lotion but provided me with a more even application.

Unfortunately after using it a few time it began to fall apart. I don't self tan regularly but I was expecting it to last longer than it did. I will be buying from another company next time.",0
"Bought Alpine Snow and I am very unhappy with this purchase because I wasted my money as though I flash it in the drain.
This nail polish is very difficult to put on, its dry and gluey. Do not buy it -not worth!",0
"I like it, a bit too sparkly for me as a bronzer.  I will try and use along my chest bone and on my shoulders.  It will be fine for these areas.",1
"it is bad, it burns the hair when you use high heat and when I use low heat it does not dry the hair. I waste my money in this product!",0
"Worked perfectly with the stellatopia moisturizing balm. My 20 month old son's scalp was so dry and itchy but after one use, he has reduced scratching substantially!",1
"I expected a heavier cream. With most moisture creams that promise extra help and protection, the cream is thick and sometimes greasy.  Mario Badescu's Moisture Magnet is not.  It goes on easily, I did not feel coated with cream and it blended with makeup.  I also mixed it with a self-tanner which helped smooth out the color and gave it a more natural look.

I would buy this product and believe the price is reasonable.  You don't need to use much to get the full benefit of its moisture value.  SPF is an added bonus - always. The sun protection is moderate, however.",1
great lip balm,1
Top,1
"I was under the impression I was ordering a super fine tip liquid liner. When I first used it I was supprised how thick the liner was. I have been trying to work with it thinking I was using it wrong, Now I have already purchased a new liner at my local drug store and love it. I'd recommend spending 3 extra dollars and get it at a local store.",0
eh,0
"Very sheer coverage, but it does cover. If you don't want a heavy foundation you should try this. I use medium and it has warm undertones.
I spray a small amount into the palm of my hand, then use a foundation brush to apply the product to the face. In my opinion, sponges waste a lot of product.
I always wait until it's on sale because full price is about 40 dollars and I can find it @ Amazon for 25.",1
Ok I love this product but it came opened. I returned it because who knows if it has been used. For that price I will buy from now on from a brick and mortar retailer.,0
"This is my favorite detangler, conditioner in a leave-on.",1
"This is a very good concealer.  I use my make-up brush to apply and it cover very well.  Will continue ordering
this product from seller.  Thank you!!",1
Love the product from ABBA.  It is also in very large quanity plastic bottles which save you money over the smaller ones that every company is pushing so that they can make the same amount of money for smaller sizes.,1
Very effective at... turning my face to ash; likely the worst facial product I've ever used & threw it in trash after maybe 8-9 uses. Avoid!,0
Not good  product,0
"This Korres Lip Butter is really great - IT LASTS on my lips longer than anything I have ever used.  The color Jasmine, however, is not flattering on me.  Too brown for my complexion.  For that reason alone I only gave it four stars - had it been pinker or peachier I would have rated it FIVE STARS.  The shine is subtle - perfect for me, and it stays put.  No matter how warm my body gets it stays on my lips and doesn't slide around.  I will be purchasing this in other colors and I would recommend this to anyone who wants soft, shiny lips!",1
"I alternate with other shampoos as they say you should so the hair doesn't become so used to one it stops working. I always go back to Awapuhi. My hair is fine and dry. Awapuhi imparts moisture but never wieghs it down. It actually leaves my blond hair shiny and almost fluffy (like a child's not like a poodle's) but not frizzy. It's gentle but gets it clean, clean, clean in one softly lathering application. There is nothing detergently about it and it feels different than other shampoos, almost like a rich gel. It rinses out easily and can wash the body as well. I don't have a great head of hair but at least with this shampoo it behaves itself. The only other shampoo that measures up is Keratase but it is expensive and the little bottle doesn't go a long way. Keratase has a formula which strenthens the hair with a creamy lather and a great hair mask which I use now to give my hair a break. But the one I always return to is Awapuhi, my old favorite.",1
Disappointing ,0
The Babybliss Pro is everything I was looking for in a dryer and more. It dries my hair quickly and leaves my hair smooth when dried. I love the nice light weight. My arm does not feel tired anymore like it died with my previous dryer. I like the three heat settings as well as the air flow settings. The best dry I have experienced in a long time!,1
"I was having a hard time deciding if this should give a two or three star review so I settled on a 2.5+.  It is called a glaze for beautiful color but I am not sure it's also supposed to also be a conditioner.  When reading the instructions, it reads as both.  I certainly noticed my hair shinier after applying the glaze (I have used it 3 times) but the conditioning was just not there.  The last time I used it I added my normal conditioner and it looked much better.  When I get my hair colored and cut I also get a 'glaze' at the salon for 20.00.  It immediately super shines my hair and super conditions it.  If this glaze did both it would be completely worth the price, but it doesn't.  The 2.5 stars is because it does make your hair shinier but you can buy shine sprays for 1/3 of the price which will do the same.  This is not a product I would recommend to anyone because of the price and the lack of a softening conditioner.",0
"My new favorite hair care products.  Clean smelling  work great,  I think the price is a bit high, but as stated, it love the way this product smelled and feels",1
fake product,0
The package was empty when I received it- just a cardboard box with no product inside.,0
"didnt last a day in my hair, didn't covere the gray",0
"To be fair I thought I ordered, still fairly sure I order the express tan. This doesn't spread as easily, its streaky. I don't know if its expired, or just a s***ty formula compared to the express tan, BUT NO THANK YOU. This is only for someone with a middle eastern or Hispanic background.",0
"My major reason to order this product was dark circles and blemishes. I used it couple times and honestly I felt no difference  when I used the product. It looked the same with and without eye correcter When applied the concelar. And I have used different concelar at least 3 different. n it a bit of creamy powder consistency but it goes on very smooth when applied. I wish it was a bit better consistency because it creases later even when use powder to set it. So, far not happy with the product. I wish i had not wasted my $ on this product n instead looked for higher ends correcter.",0
"nope, didn't work. i'm sticking with Organic Tumeric powder for whitening",0
"I bought this in place of the serum because the serum just made my skin sticky and eventually oily. Unfortunately this product was no better. I used the tiniest amount and it just felt like the serum, it made my skin greasy and it just felt like I had a film on my face. I returned it. Definitely worth the money I paid. I'm going to just stick with Este Lauder.",0
"As advertised, this is a gentle foaming cleanser that does leave behind softer skin.  It contains some excellent ingredients that I look for in skin care products, Taurine, Niacinamide, and Cucumber Extract.  The Taurine part is an amino acid that supposedly and hopefully over time produces antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and moisturizing benefits.

The feel of the cleanser is very pleasant.  It's extremely light and airy and rinses off easily.  There was a faint but pleasant fragrance, not at all objectionable.",1
Great product! Except I ordered 3 AC11 and only 2 were delivered plus one Replenish that I didn't order.,1
"This shampoo is hard to find.  One Big Boix Store sells it once a year, maybe not in all locations.  Been using for many years at the suggestion of my hairstylist.  Used to purchase from an online beauty supply, which is no longer.  Now buying here at a new low price!  With Prime and S&S benefits I think this is the best deal on this product I've found.",1
I had a esthetician at my day spa recommend this stuff. She's very good at what she does and has proven to be quite knowledgeable...until this. She was sooooo wrong about this. I don't find it any different from the Almay facewash. Waste of money,0
"i bought this product before from amazon & it was AWESOME.
i just ordered another one since mine was about to finish. & to my surprise its so different than the first one. its so GREASY like.
& its weighing the hair down like u just put baby oil on it. Disappointed as i really liked the first one.
maybe this was a defective one. but definitely not the agadir argan oil!!",0
This is the best hats off to the maker and to Amazon for this fine product.,0
"Was really discouraged to find out it was clear. I couldn't tell where it is on and how much. I had no Idea this product was clear, be ware, it makes shaving diicult",0
"Would live to say that this was the best hair dryer diffuser I have ever used... the problem?  The ""universal"" diffuser would not fit either of my blow dryers, which are your basic brands and sizes. The diffuser must be used with a dryer that is either narrow or tapered. It appears to be a quality product, but doesn't meet my needs and is destined for the charity bin.",0
This product smells amazing!,1
what I expected,1
"The smell of this product is so overpowering, I actually had to rinse it out of my hair. It is also very drying, so my curly frizzy hair got more frizzy with this product. The only way I can use up the bottle that I can't return is to use my old product Redken 01 Outshine Anti-Frizz Polishing Milk Styling Hair Styling Serums, then apply a little bit of this Morracan oil product to add extra hold. I would NOT buy this again, the smell is so strong.",0
still my go to dry shampoo - though the can does leak and lose it's aerosol after 5 or so uses.,1
"Smells awful! This came in a set with other Mitch hair products.  They smell strongly but okay - this smells like magarita mix or gold tequilla with the lime.  There is a hint of bug spray when it starts to dry.  Maybe this is a good product to use before a pool party, Jimmy Buffet concert or going on a long night of wild drinking.",0
"My wife loves this stuff, the only problem was that the box was just the right size to barely fit in my standard mailbox, so the lazy postman jammed the box into my mailbox and once it got in past the inward rolled edge, it was really hard to get out, took 30 minutes - meanwhile it was over 100 outside and the stuff melted. a fifteen minute stay in the fridge fixed that and I called the Post Office and complained.",1
"I bought this mascara because I got a sample in a gift pack and loved it.  The regular sized mascara is disappointing.  The wand is very flimsy and cheap-looking, the brush is slim, and the mascara comes out really thick so separation with a brush is required.  I won't buy this mascara again.  My Almay $6 mascara is much better.",0
Love this! It's a staple in my daily routine. Shiny touchable waves!,1
Defiantly thought this was going to be a game changer with All the reviews... but i was disappointed.,0
"I love theBalm products and this liquid lipstick is pretty great, the color is gorgeous-but I find it wears strangely on me, kind of disappears in the center of my mouth, leaving a ring of color that looks really weird.  It doesn't do this to my daughters so I believe it's just the way my mouth is.  Bummer.  It's not horribly drying, the packaging is great, shipping was quick and it's so, so pretty!",1
"I really like this product.  Due to weight loss surgery, my hair has been thinning. This product does what it says and helps to thicken up my hair in preparation for Toppik hair building fibers.  Love it.",1
"Disappointed, not like it used to be. The colors were odd and did not cover as well as it used to. Also, learned my lesson from buying from outside vendor. I will never buy anything I cannot return, I only ordered because I was desperate and could not find it locally.",0
"You can keep this liner for a long while but unfortunately this is not waterproof and is fairly easy to rub off. Color is lighter than expected and somehow gets lighter throughout the day, Not horrible but not great. Not worth the money for those with mono lids or oily eyelids.",0
I'm a smoker and this toothpaste did not whiten my teeth...my mouth feels clean and fresh but the whitening power fails.,0
Works really well and get very hot!,1
"I'm not completely sure what all the positive stars are about. Maybe I got a bad bottle? No idea, but I saw this on a beauty youtube video, highly recommended---so I splurged and bought it. However, like a lot of other 1 stars reviews, I didn't like the smell. To me it also smelled like rancid grease, and was really off-putting. I didn't think it left my skin particularly soft either. Either way, I'm going to see if I can return it, I wasn't happy at all, smelled terrible. To each is own I guess.",0
"I had always wanted to try this product, but through the years was always disappointed with other products, I noticed one day in salon hairdresser using this on customer, it was a different brand.  I still thought about it and one day my sister mentioned to me she was going to try this product, she did and well happy happy.  I decided to check online at Amazon, not only was the price far superior, but the product was even better...I am a happy happy girl, you could  see my scalp through my hairline, now you can't.  Thank you everyone Amazon for pricing and the product itself.  FABULOUS!!!",1
I was introduced to this line by a spa and just love the feel and the results;  its a keeper.,1
"I love this sunscreen... disappointed that it expires on three months :/
Just received it in the mail today",0
"Be prepared to use half the pencil on just one eyebrow... even the slightest pressure to your brow causes the color lead to break off....
Also a muddy brown green color.... find another pencil girls!!",0
Terrible product. I have up use 5-6 cotton pads of the eye makeup remover to remove the product. And then when you wash your face it becomes clear that the eye makeup remover has not removed everything so you have to use the product again. Very frustrating!,0
Product made my skin feel sucked dry of moisture. Returned it.,0
"I'm new to the world of manly man shaving, but I'm pretty excited about it. I've had some the closest shaves so far from this and razor burn is fading out of my personal lexicon.  I'm still getting used to the smooth touch required for an old school blade and have cut myself a few times.  I was using disposables for way too long.  I am glad I got the long handle though because the long handle is about as long as a regular disposable handle.  I did do a lot of research and Merkur has the best name around.",1
I've used this before and I knew it would work. I highly recommend it to people who need to to cover their hair loss.,1
I love the color. Only needs 2 coats.,1
The product smelled like an old. Even though it was within the expiration date I was affraid of using it.,0
"The product description says 'lightly scented' but there is nothing light about this scent.  It's like putting paint thinner on your face.  If you are a person with allergies or asthma, and especially if you are sensitive to chemical smells like lysol or other people's perfume, be ready for this stuff to cause you endless irritation.  I didn't even get finished putting it on my forehead before I realized I couldn't get it anywhere near my nose.  I had to go wash it off.",0
Love to try all these beauties,1
"The picture was deceptive, it looked like a normal size bottle and container.  Shame on me for not examining the weight.",0
"I love this shade of pink. It's so subtle and soft in appearance. Yet when applied your nails look so striking and pretty. This will be my new ""go to"" soft shade when a bright color won't do. It wears so well it's awesome that it lasts so long. That's why I only purchase OPI nail lacquers because of how resilient they are.",1
"I bought this and started using it and halfway through the bottle it won't spray anymore.  Going back to my order, there isn't a spot to contact the seller, so all I can do is rate the products bad... :(

Waste of money since I can't access the product.",0
"I bought replacement heads for my Clarisonic, but decided to buy a generic version to save money and they stripped my skin raw leaving my face flakey and blotchy from irritation.

After seeing a dermatologist, she recommended the sensitive facial heads and it made a significant difference! Now I can exfoliate once a week and my skin is looking brighter and smoother than ever.",1
Refreshing,1
FAKE PRODUCT. Do not buy.,0
I wouldn't have ordered if I knew it came from Hong Kong.  It took almost a month to arrive and then had to be signed for.  The polish was thinner than it should have been and chipped after a few days.  It doesn't seem to be authentic OPI.,0
"I am relatively new to wet shaving, and got this soap mainly because it had high reviews and was well priced. While I can get a good lather from this soap there are several things I dislike about it:

- It leaves a filmy residue behind on my razor, so I can only imagine what's left on my face.
- While some enjoy the tingly feel, I found doing several passes with this soap to be uncomfortable.
- It doesn't seem to offer much protection. I almost always end up bleeding from either pulled hairs or nicks when using this soap - I have had much more success with products form ""The Art Of Shaving.""
- Once you remove the soap from your face your skin is left dry, not slick, making touch up passes more difficult.

I have gotten a lot of use out of this soap, as it has lasted me several months, but I would recommend avoiding this if at all possible.",0
Horrible product. Don't buy it.,0
Very pleased,1
Great packaging. Smells nice. Filmy. I felt like a residue was left on my face after cleansing. Won't buy again.,0
"Really like this brush, works great on many types of hair. DO NOT attempt to use it in any country with different current. Even through a transformer, it blew out this brush and I have to buy a new one.",1
Breaks easy.,1
Smells great only issue the cover was broken and some of the oil leaked out!,0
I had very high hopes for this organic cleanser but was kind of disappointed it didn't work for my oily acne prone skin. I struggle with a few hormonal cystic breakouts around that time of the month and some pimples here and there. My skin routine i was doing at the time worked for me for like a year in a half and then all of sudden my skin started to break out and I knew I needed to find an acne kit. I was trying to not use anything to harsh on my face so I thought I'd try the organic route. I red a couple positive reviews on juice beauty so I went to my local ulta and pick this up for $39.00. I knew that when you start a new skin routine your skin may break out a little because all the dirt and oil's being pulled to the surface and then It should start getting better. I used the whole kit twice a day like it says. This worked the 1st couple of times i used then my skin started to become more oily and I started to get a few cystic bumps nooooo nightmare! I stopped using this on my oily acne skin bought clean and clear advantage and have almost fully cleared my acne thank god! I gave this cleanser to my boyfriend and it works amazing for his normal skin type not fair! The organic route just didn't work for my skin type. Would recommend the juice beauty vitamin c serum though!,0
The color you can see in pictures are a little different from actual,0
"The color is pretty true to the bottle, which was good since I had trouble finding good swatches for this color online.  The first coat went on kind of pink, but once I applied the second coat it got much darker and more red.  I applied three coats, just to make it a little darker, but I could have gotten away with just two.  I was trying to match my Sally Hansen Brilliant Bourdeaux nail polish.  This color came pretty close, but is slightly more pink, whereas the Brilliant Bourdeaux is more of a blood red.  In the sun, you can also see a lot of shimmer in the color.  It applied easily and finished smooth and shiny.  I definitely love this color for fall and winter.  The 0.25ml bottle is smaller than most nail polish bottles, but you apply such thin coats that I can't imagine running out of it anytime soon.  Highly recommend this color!",1
"I been using this cream since may 2013 it had wonderful Reviews but as of today it those not do what it said , I will not buy or recomend this at all.",0
Way more transparent than I thought. Pretty color with fine glitter. It's nice as a tint of color. Need 3-4 coats for opaqueness,1
"The smell of this product is great, coupled with the Lemon + Sage lotion you will smell fresh and clean all day.",1
"Awesome product. Smells so amazing and leaves skin refreshed. I use it multiple times a day, especially over powder foundation when it starts looking dry. Will be re-purchasing ASAP.",1
"I wish this had a light that said when the iron was heated up, instead a red light is constant. Sometimes the barrel seems to be stiff and stick to my hair even with no product in it. Overall it's a great value and a better price here than at beauty stores.",1
"I'm 50, so I've got some wrinkles around my eyes. I also still get occasional blemishes (so frustrating!). The skin around my eyes has always been very thin looking, and hardly ever appears ""right"" with concealer, even though I do have minor dark circles that I would like to cover up.

I was willing to give this liquid concealer a try, and I'm very glad I did! It goes on very lightly, almost like foundation, but it covers better. I was able to use it easily to cover my under-eye circles and a few blemishes elsewhere on my face. It looks natural, and feels light as a feather.

It stayed looking good for nearly 8 hours, but after that did begin to settle into my wrinkles. Still much better than the regular under-eye treatment I had used before that settled into wrinkles right after I'd applied it.",1
A+A+,1
good product. worth the money.,1
"This is a nice set for both men and women. The finished nail color is crisp and clean; nails look natural and healthy. The satin topcoat is not glossy but rather produces a matte, natural finsh. I love the look, but the only issue I have is that it chips within 3-4 days.",1
I wash my hands a lot - this skin oil keeps them from getting dry and cracked. It's easy to spritz on and not too greasy.,1
Love this product!,1
"It's just ok. I got the lightest and it still has an orange undertone. If you're looking to cover up a tattoo realistically, I'd go with another product.",0
Not exactly what I was expecting. It didn't glide through my hair...more like pulled it out. it did heat up fast! Probably the only good thing about it.,0
"Great product! I was wondering if the angle would be worth it, and while I can't say that it's *much* better than using your typical brush, it was definitely helpful. The brush applies eyeliner beautifully and I love the bristles. I've never used a brush for eyeliner like this (instead of a flat angled one) and it turns out that the way this brush works was better than my other ones of a different shape.",1
My wife loves chi in all the products and purchased all it does great with her hair. She has long thick curly hair also so she says it's hard to manage but this is great for that.,1
It's a pretty color but it's sheer and takes too many coats to build up. I will have to combine it with another color to get solid coverage. Would not have bought if I'd have known this.,0
this product was not as advertised! the picture of the color amore was soft pink..When I got it (color amore) it was a deep purple!! threw it away. what a waste of money...,0
Used this product for years. The results Do Not Last More than a few hours and at DOUBLE THE PRICE ITS NOT WORTH IT. Save your money!,0
I tried it for about 2 weeks and found it not to be helpful.  I'm using another product which works better for my dark circles.,0
"I don't like this.  i wanted to use it in between washes, but it just makes my hair sticky and i need to wash it sooner than normal wear.",0
excelente,1
I will definitely not use this product again.  I have very sensitive skin and this over-priced product caused red bumps to appear on my face within seconds of applying it.  It took several days for my skin to completely heal.  I'll stick to Neutrogena's oil free moisturizer for sensitive skin.  This has been my go-to moisturizer for years.  It's never irritated my skin or caused acne.,0
"Works well, but you go through a bottle pretty fast, as you need more than you would with an acetone based remover.",1
it wasn't package as advertised. The product works well however.,1
"I have been a Toppik user for many years now and have enjoyed the use of their products. I was upset though when I received my purchase that it was not at all as it was shown in their advertisement.
They had a picture of a larger size of the Toppik, 25gm, yet I was sent the small one, 10.3gm?
I was not very pleased to say the least when I open the package..
Besides being mislead, the product itself is fine..",0
"The one thing that irritates me is this diffuser is said to fit MOST blow dryers, it took my the longest time to figure out how to get it to fit my blow dryer. I wish they would have had a directions in it.
The product itself is a great product. I have no complaints it does a wonderful job with my hair, I use it all the time. I recommend to everyone. The shipping and delivery are very efficent also!",1
Excellent transaction and good product!,1
"This is really dry, more like a paint than a gloss. It immediately settles in the cracks of my lips. Maybe used best as a base under another gloss. I ordered the praline color.",0
Great to disguise small areas that are thinning and just don't overdo it. I am quite happy with this product.,1
"I thought this curling iron would really be salon quality since most salons use this brand but it didn't compare to my cheap Conair curling iron.  I don't have very course hair and I had it on the highest setting and it didn't hold a curl very long at all.  Needless to say, I had to return it for the price.",0
Did not state it was for chemically treated hair. Was expecting regular and suspect the chemically treated is hard to unload thus the misrepresentation.,0
I've been using it on my face after morning face wash and don't really see any difference on my skin. I also use it after doing my makeup some days as a setting spray but feels like it makes my makeup feel heavy.,1
I love this gel primer because it does live up to it's advertising and helps your skin be revitalized.  Thanks for making a product that is trustworthy and helps aging skin look better when used with the NuFace microcurrent technology device.,1
I bought this for a trip to France and I used it with a plug converter and it worked great!,1
"makes my hair greasy and limb. not a fan....my solution is hair fiber, that powder stuff that attaches to your hair, comes in different colors. that does the trick for me... its just an illusion but it makes me feel better",0
"I look younger, all my friends and family say. That's good enough to say about this product. It makes you look and feel younger.",1
Worth the money if you have bonded teeth! I could tell a difference after 2 applications! I get my teeth whitened and was surprised on how well it whitened the fake tooth.,1
"Pleasantly surprised by this product.

I'm 37, and I have just a hint of fine lines beginning to show under my left eye (from driving), which I'm not going to let happen if I can help it.  And I know there is no miracle cream and such, but I do expect results when I shell out good money for beauty products.

The cream is light and relatively scent free.  I like that it doesn't absorb right into my skin, and that is leaves a little bit of a barrier at night when I go to sleep.  I notice that the lines are staying exactly the same, which means they aren't getting any worse.  This is my first tube, so hopefully after the second one the lines will be less noticeable.  It doesn't make me break out, isn't greasy or heavy and the price isn't extravagant (considering some of the other stuff I use on my face) so I'm happy with this for now.",1
"I admit I'm a flat iron novice, but this did not work well for my hair. I have thin hair, but a lot of it and it is long.  It is naturally straight, so I wanted to use this for curling spirals and under.  I couldn't get it to work right, probably because I needed very, very small sections and had to go over the same strands multiple times. The iron heated up but not to what the temp read. I had it on 400 and it felt much cooler. I returned it.",0
Only lasted 8 months...the strength of the turbine diminishes overtime and eventually becomes unusable.,0
"This is a very thin, clear oil.  It isn't as thick as baby oil and runs almost like water.  I would never put oil or an oil-based product on my skin because it clogs the pores.  Some people might be able to get away with it, but even though I have dry skin, my skin will break out if I put oil on it, so I have skipped that test.  I did rub it into my hands and it dries fast without leaving an oily slick.

What I did use this for is my hair, which is very thick and very dry.  After shampooing, I poured a little bit of the oil into my hand and rubbed my hands together.  Then I ran my hands through my hair, keeping the oil away from the scalp area.  Afterwards, I blew my hair dry then applied more oil.  Usually, I apply a gel in the same manner that calms the frizz and leaves my hair with a nice shine to it.  However, the oil did not produce the same results.  My hair still had flyaway ends with no gloss to it.  My newly washed and dried hair always looks better the next morning after the hair product has had a chance to calm the frizzy hair shafts, but the morning after I used the oil, the results were no different than the night before.

Ill stick to my gel product to end the frizziness of dry hair.",0
"Beautiful bright pink nail polish! I bought the Zoya kit to go with it (top, base coat, polish remover). If you use the kit, the polish will last at least a week on your fingernails, and at least two weeks on your toenails.",1
"I got the 3oz bottle and have had it for less than 3 months. I use it sparingly, MAYBE 1-2 times a week so that's 15 uses. It is already empty. It was expensive to last a handful of times.",0
"smeells good but its just not an antiperspirant, didn't work for me. surprised since ck has good products maybe I got a defective one",0
This is a very nice hairdryer.  It works quickly and my hair isn't frizzy.  It is too early to give it five stars.  That will only be if it lasts more than 2 or 3 years.,1
"This is absolutely a knock off, it is not the normal color or scent.",0
I was not all that impressed with this shampoo for the price I paid for it. I like Crew better for the quality and price.,0
I love the way this makes my skin feel and look and no parabens.,1
"I had purchased this product for the sole purpose of lip exfoliation, but was disappointed to find that it is not as effective in lip exfoliation as I thought it would be. I love the smell and the feeling of the sugar on my lips, but when I all is said and done, I still have dead skin that was not removed from the process. I was disappointed with this product, especially since I feel like it is overpriced for the size/amount offered. I don't believe I will be purchasing this again.",0
"i have ordered this perfume before frrom amazon.. and was always very happy with it

 this time... it is a different color... less of the original scent and was  disappointed...

sorry.. wish  i could say more positive things.. as it is a beautiful fragrance",0
Get Philips 5300 instead.,0
Makes hair fall out  after using for a month. I never realized it was this shampoo/ so sad because I wanted to like it.,0
Does seem as to last as long  As department store,0
"This is my favorite bath soap for my 6 month old. It's very gentle on his skin and scalp, and we love the scent.",1
"This sunscreen is gritty. I even tried shaking it up, but it was still gritty upon application. Either there's a defect in the formulation or this product is old.",0
It heats up super fast and does a great job on my curly hair! Love the different temperature settings and the mat it comes with!,1
buying these to give at baby showers coming up.  all three bottles leaking when i opened wet box.  post office will not allow me to return wet box and i just rinsed all the bottles off.  only missing about an ounce in each.  will not buy online again. sad,1
Nail polish peeled right off within hours this was a waste of money,0
did not work when i opened the box to use it for the first time.,0
"I used up an entire container of this stuff a year ago after buying it from a salon supplier. I LOVED it. When I ordered this replacement, I was incredibly disappointed by the consistency of the product and the lack of any hold whatsoever. It didn't have the same effect at all as it did when I bought it at a legit store.",0
I have one and they are great. Bought another as a gift. You won't regret.,1
Does not work that well for me. I'll stick with coconut oil,0
"I like the product - Toppik; however, this dispenser was useless.  I was looking forward to using this to get the Toppik precisely where & how much I wanted it.  The Toppik clogged the dispenser and NONE would come out.  I am back to sprinkling it out of the bottle.",0
It was perfect and did not pull my hair when wet!,1
Natural moroccan argan oil (much cheaper) works better than the Surface Bassu Gold oil shine.  I will stick with the argan oil.,0
I LOVE this concealer! Although they make much bigger sizes for less money. I wouldnt mind paying $30 if it was twice as big!,0
"Very greasy. When I would apply it to my neck, it would make my hair greasy as well. So disgusting.",0
Really love this product!  I have mild-moderate hair loss on the top of my head.  I use it after I have styled my hair to fill in where my scalp shows through. It covers the spots and looks very natural.,1
Well made razor. The handle is a good length.,1
Dryed out my skin!,0
Very thick and hard to spread,0
Works great. I have thick wavy hair and it worked great and made my hair soft and shiny.,1
Very good quality! Love it!,1
"I have not bought this product, so ignore the 2 stars. I had to click something.  I only want to state the ingredients list is wrong. This is a SOAP-FREE bar, and I see 2 surfactant listed in the ingredient list. I also see Cetearyl Alcohol listed twice. Whoever wrote this ingredient list needs to contact the company who makes the product and ask for the correct one. I highly doubt a large company like Avene would screw up their ingredient list so bad as to list something twice.",0
I like this product. It moisturizers my ends and gives my hair texture. It has a nice smell too. It smells similar to Davines this is a sea salt spray.,1
This is terrible! Stopped blowing warm air after 8 weeks. I bought another one thinking it must have been a fluke but the same thing happened.,0
"Great product for moisturizing.  Also, unlike other masks it doesn't matter if you leave it on.  I just put it on thinly if I plan  to leave it on.  I wake up with my skin glowing and less little wrinkles.",1
I tried this one as my first matte polish and I was dissapointed. Even with a matte top coat it chipped almost immediatly. It was also very difficult to apply evenly. The color was nice I guess but I would go with a more traditional finish one next time.,0
This moisturizer is my favorite. I use it on my own skin because I have such sensitive skin and it smells fantastic! It's cheaper than the target and wal mart price too!!! If you're looking for a high quality moisturizer that won't break the bank every time this is it!,1
"NO oxybenzone, NO parabens, NO aluminum.
Stablized avobenzone with Polyester-8.
Goes on clear, not greasy.
No flakiness or pilling.
SPF 30, PA+++
Try finding those qualities in another sunscreen.",1
"This shampoo does not lather. It's like conditioner except it doesn't leave hair greasy. Smells good but not an overpowering smell. Supposedly this cleanser does not strip hair of color or natural oils. I don't know if that's true. I am satisfied but it takes time to get used to the fact that you're using a non lathering cleanser. The Amazon price is excellent, in my opinion. I've purchased again and will probably continue to do so. Will probably try some of the other UNwash products.",1
"This moisturizer may be expensive, but you get what you pay for in this case! First of all, it's very thick. You don't need a lot to cover your entire face. The fact that it has sunscreen in it is really nice because it eliminates a step in your makeup routine. It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth. Because I have oily skin, I use this as a winter moisturizer when my skin needs a little additional help. In the summer, I use it on my neck only. It does have a smell, as other reviewers noted, but I didn't find it overwhelmingly unpleasant, and it dissipated quickly. The important question: Does it firm skin? I really do think I've seen a difference since I've been using this. I'm really happy with this moisturizer.",1
This is an excellent and thorough makeup remover.  Definitely the most effective I've ever tried.  My only gripe is that you need to use it with cotton pads and therefore have to remember to do it before you get in the shower. Which I frequently forget to do.  I also don't like that it doesn't come with a tamper proof seal...it's just open.  Seems like anyone could mess with it...,1
"It took me a while to switch to this.

Without too much facial hair, I never gave shaving much thought. I needed something simple that just got the job done. I started with Mach 3, then went to the Fusion which are both pretty decent. The price of cartridges always seemed ridiculous though.

I had held back on Merkur's because I had thought you needed the full setup  badger brush, shaving creams and soaps, razor stand, etc. etc. I thought I had to take more time in the morning so that I wouldn't cut myself in a rush.

Nope. You can keep it simple still. Just shower, shaving cream, and water is all that's needed. Fast as any other method for me.",1
"This is not a quick fix. ""Training"" your face will take weeks if not months to see results and you will need to continue using it to keep those results (whatever they maybe). I started using the NuFace for only a few weeks ago but I have seen some improvement in the ""tone"" of my face. Keep in mind that I'm 40 and only have a few fine lines around my eyes, forehead and only very minor sagging around the jaw line.  But I believe in being proactive so I gave NuFace a try.

First of all I urge anyone to watch as many of the youtube videos you can on how to use this product; thats what I did and they were extremely helpful.  Second don't start on the recommended highest setting (it may really hurt as it did for me) but instead start on the lowest and gradually work your way up. Third, work in small sections. The gel primer they provide dries really, really fast and you need it for the NuFace to work.  You don't want to ""pull"" the skin upward but ""slide"" on the gel upward.  The best tip I got was to keep a spray bottle of water handy and spry between treatments to keep the skin moist, otherwise you have to stop and apply the gel all over again.  Finally, after you've used up all your gel buy something cheaper i.e. aloe vera will work just as well.

***Best tip I can give anyone is to purchase from a place with a great return policy because it will take a while to see (if any) results and this is a major investment.",1
Great hand cream!,1
The bottle is not the size I expected. It's very tiny for the money. I'm not sure I like the loose powder but it does give your hair some body and lift on top. I felt like I had to wash my hair that evening. Concerned now with its safety rating on the cosmetic database. I didn't see that rating before I bought it. It's ranked as a 7 for hazards. That makes it in the red for safety which is not good. It's my fault for not checking it out before I bought it. I'm sure it does a good job but it's just not for me.,0
"I love this lip gloss. I had previously bought it in the tub & had dropped it & broke it (because it is glass). I liked it so much that I reordered it & when I saw that it also came in a tube I also ordered it so it would be easy to carry in my purse. I recd it about the first of May & all was great until 4 days ago when I opened it to use it & it smelled soured! Very strong odor. I have no idea how it happened. I have not left it in the heat which is the only way I can see that this could happen on my part. I am really bummed considering that I have only used 15%-20% of the tube. I am going to contact the manufacturer for a replacement. Ill update this post to let yall know if I was able to do that.
Addressing the issue of the gloss being too sticky...I have discovered that it only takes a very tiny bit on your lips. If you put on too much, it will be too sticky. This is the best gloss I have used. Im addicted now! Fortunately I still have the tub that I kept at home. Wish me luck on getting a replacement!",0
"I have no idea why this product received 5 stars from anyone. I've used a lot of good hair products in the past and this is not one of them. It does nothing to enhance your hair. You'd be better off just brushing your hair. Trust me, save your money and do not purchase.",0

"This is my favorite self tanner ever. It's not a spray, so it doesn't get all over the place like others I've used. And it's actually very moisturizing, so your legs and body don't feel tan but flaky! It goes on evenly, and is subtle, but you can add more later if you like it a little darker. It's a very natural color, and does not smell bad, amazingly. I apply with my hands - not a mitt, so I can tell how much I'm applying. Just wash hands after & you're good to go! I love it. Buy it, so they don't stop making it! :-)",1

"l have been using the Nioxin system for 7 weeks now.  And am well pleased with how it has increased the amount of hair I have now 7 weeks later.  Nothing extreme but I had thinning hair due to my age.  I can tell more hair is growing in because of the part in the middle of my head, on top of my head has narrowed, meaning more hair.  Now if I can only find a good face cr&egrave;me to tighten my skin. Would recommend for someone else to use.",1

This is a good leave-in conditioner to help with damaged ends. I have natural curly hair and I have to blow dry it when I wash it in order to style it  Also the winter mornings are cold so you really don't want wet hair going out the door.,1

That being said, this sensitive skin cream is not my favorite.  I enjoy their classic scent much more than this one, and I can't say as though I noticed any additional protection from the sensitive skin cream vs. classic.

Still a great product, just not my favorite from theirs.",1
I didn't notice any difference.  Save your money.,0
"Do not buy from this company. This is not pureology shampoo in this pureology bottle. I don't even think it is shampoo at all. The bottle came with the lid taped shut.

I have had great success with the St Tropez gradual tan but not with this one. I am very pale and barely notice any results with this. I follow all the directions and the first time I waited 3 hours and saw nothing and the next time I waited 6 hours and I barely see any tan. Very disappointed,0

This is a great product but a bit more expensive than like products purchased at Walmart or anywhere else.  However, I can tell the difference after using the first bottle purchased earlier this year at a salon.  My hair is fine and thin but it looks great using this product and I have actually, even at my old age, gotten a few compliments on how well my hair looks.  It has to be the product as I do not curl my hair and only blow dry and finger comb in place.  This is my product of choice now.",1

"I received this free through the Amazon Vine program. I wouldn't have purchased it at this price (especially for such a small quantity).

I do not have a problem with adult acne, just redness and uneven skin tone and was inform that this would help.  I then added it to my morning routine, and did not see any improvement in my results.  To be honest, I have gotten more results with my apple cider vinegar and water toner than this.  At the time, I was dropping my toner and using this instead (did not want to dry my skin out).  My skin tone got more uneven, so I stopped this and added my toner back in.  Needless to say I am returning this!",0
"This shampoo used to work better, just a few months ago. I have extremely hard water. The shampoo the first time bottles- worked great. The conditioner never worked good for me.

"I use shaving soap and a brush/mug when I'm home.  This is a high quality, inexpensive system, but it doesn't travel well.  On the road, I generally use a can of gel, which is more expensive, messier, and slower than a brush and soap.  This stuff is more expensive than gel, doesn't lubricate as well, and is more difficult to apply because it doesn't ""stick"" as easily to wet skin.  I give it two stars because I'm going to use the rest of the can, but I sure won't be buying any more.",0
"I'm a big fan of Art of Shaving products.  Their shaving soaps are the finest I've ever used. That said, this lemon-scented shaving cream is the worst shaving product I've used since becoming a dedicated DE shaver.

First impression?  The lemon scent is offensively, cloyingly sweet.  It made me fear I'd just used a very nice badger-tail brush to apply a thick coat of lemon merengue pie to my face.  And that is no way to start your morning.

Second impression? It offers the same lubrication as applying wet sand to Scotch tape.  Seriously. I use top-grade Feather DE blades, and they would literally skid to a stop across even the smoothest, flattest planes of my face.  Imagine a 14-year-old boy trying to figure out how to drive a stick shift on wet oavement and without any instruction -- my shave was that choppy.

I tried this product for precisely two reasons.  I love AOS stuff, and I wanted to save myself the minute or two it takes to whip a shaving soap into a proper cream. Two weeks later, my poor beard is still paying for my mistake.

I can only hope that someday my beard will forgive me.",0

Aargh! Still love the product when it works, but too expensive to keep buying.

ORIGINAL REVIEW 5/16/17:  For years, I quit wearing mascara because no matter what brand I tried, I had smudges and looked like raccoon eyes. Finally, my daughter introduced me to Blinc and I love it. I give the product and effectiveness 5 stars, but I give the dispenser and customer service 1 star.

I was surprised the first time I used it. It stayed on and did not get under my eyes. If it gets on your skin by mistake, it's best to let it dry and then remove it with a damp towel or tissue. It removes easily with water. If you try to remove it while it is still fresh (wet), it spreads a lot, so best to let it dry, then remove it. At the end of the day, it easily washes off with water and the little black tubes of mascara rinse away; no makeup remover needed.

The negative I have is that the portion of the tube that the brush goes through sometimes comes loose. It gets stuck in the cap, so there is no resistance to clean the brush off before it is pulled out of the tube. Therefore, it is just a blob of mascara (see photos) and absolutely impossible to apply. When it happens, there is absolutely no way to fix it, so unless you have another tube, your stuck. Once in a while, if lucky, it goes back in and you can use it until it does it again.

I called Blinc Customer Service, who was less than helpful or concerned. In my experience, most cosmetic companies willingly replace items that have a problem with the package, product or color, but Blinc representatives were not helpful. According to them, I could return to store and if it meets store return policy they will exchange it. Or, I could mail back to them and they would access if I had done something wrong in opening and using the product and then determine if they will replace it. They also said, I must have screwed the lid on too tight, so the inside seal got stuck the lid. Basically, they tried to think of every reason to blame the customer. They said they will look at the code numbers too, to determine how old it is and they want a receipt. Seems like a lot of work when they already know they have a problem with the applicators. Other cosmetic companies are much more accommodating with defective containers.

I like the product so much and it's the first time in my life, I like wearing mascara without the smudge look under my eyes. So far, I have bought 2 more tubes (total of 3), one of which has the same problem. This is expensive mascara and I cannot afford to just have bad tubes sitting around and keep buying more. So, I'm frustrated and unsure how to handle it. I still like it and wear it, but only use it about once weekly, due to the problem with the tube applicator and the negative, unhelpful customer service.",0
It appears to have strengthened my nails.,1
This didn't blend as easily as when I had purchased at Sephora. change ingredients?,0
this stuff does nothing for me other than condition me. i'm a natural red head who has faded to a sort of reddish brown. it doesn't pick up my highlights or anything. maybe i need the shampoo or maybe it's really for people with dyed hair. it stains your hands and fingernails. i guess i should have seen that coming.,0
Long wearing!,1
"Doesn't get very hot, but good airflow.  The plastic broke after a few months of use and I had to tape it together to hold the plastic in place.",0
NOT smudge proof at all. That is a major MISREPRESENTATION. This eye liner is comparable to Revlon Color Stay. No matter what they claim you're still wiping the smudge off from under your eye after just a couple hours. But at 20 bucks I expected this stuff to actually be better. You pay a lot of money for something you expect it to do what it claims! Do not waste your cash people. I don't think there really is such a thing as smudge proof!,0
"Yikes! Very Coarse Salt! Not for those with skin Issues!
Like bathing with shards of glass!",0
"Goes on smoothly, and has good bristles but the color wasn't exactly how I had pictures. I will still use it, especially since I am trying to get my boyfriend to buy my engagement ring ",1
Love it! Finally something that will help my baby fine hair hold its shape! The only drawback is that it does dry out my hair.,1
"I don't think it does much for the thickness of my hair (based on comparisons over time), but I'm allergic to cocomide products (used to make shampoos sudsy) and this either has none of it, or such a small amount that it doesn't affect me. I'll keep using it as long as they make it.",1
This soap is pricey but it's very refreshing and energizing...the wife loves it. I only gave it 4 stars because they didn't package it well enough and it arrived leaking...but it wasn't too bad.,1
"I love this tool however it is my third one. The last one had broken bristles, wish they had extra bristles to replace.",1
"The best eyelash curler ever. I love love love it.  Works quickly so I don't have to do it again and run the risk of pulling lashes or breaking them. The reason for the 4 stars is it isn't very durable and I have to buy a new one once a year, even if I replace the little white rubber strip.  I thought maybe I was being too rough, but it didn't last long even when I started using kid gloves with it",1
"This color is gorgeous. Like any matte nail polish, it dries extremely quickly - which is a definite plus if you are crunched for time. You MUST try this color with a glossy top coat, though - it really brings out how beautiful this polish is.",1
Completely satisfied,1
I do not like this product. My hair was flat and didn't hold it's shape. I really want my money back. Expensive and doesn't give the results it promised.,0
I give NeoCutis Bio-restorative Eye cream four stars because I like SkinMedica TNS eye repair a bit more. This is less expensive than Skin Medica and it works almost as well. I don't think it helps with under-eye puffiness but it does help diminish the fine lines around my eyes. I had been using this eye cream for the past four years.,1
"Beware of purchasing this product on Amazon. It is likely either counterfeit or very old. I went to a salon and purchased a legitimate bottle. It cost $45 for two 1 liter bottles which is much less expensive than this product on Amazon. The differences were immediately apparent. In the attached image, the real product is on the left, and the product purchased from HFB Store on Amazon is on the right.

Product from Amazon:
- More expensive
- Caused very dry scalp and itching
- No tea tree tingling feeling
- No suds
- Runny
- Transparent green color

Product from Salon:
- No dry scalp or itching
- Strong tea tree tingling
- Very sudsy
- Pearly green color

The bottle clearly warns about counterfeiting and that the product is only guaranteed if purchased from a professional salon. See the attached image. As for online authorized sellers, the only ones listed on Paul Mitchell's website are PaulMitchell, Ulta, JCPenney and LoxaBeauty.",0
"At first it was working well, my hair was soft so I was hmm ok. But while using this, I noticed that my hair was falling out more than usual. The only new thing in my routine was this. Almost a month later my hair is now thinning and I have a bald spot. This product is TERRIBLE. Also the smell is nasty, its like a minty but yet stinky smell.. cant explain",0
"An excellent scent for a reasonable price, particularly for a young professional man in his mid-twenties. This sample will give you a pretty good idea whether or not you will like the larger bottles. The fragrance is made out of Indian fig leaf, fig fruit, coriander, clary sage, leather, lime and plum. It is also spiced with cinnamon, pepper, along with wooden accords of cedar and sandalwood.",1
"I got this from reading all the reviews.  When I tried it for the first time, one side did not heat up, so obviously it was not working correctly.  However, I didn't like the design because it pinches like tweezers instead of the plates being flat against each other.  I went to Ulta to see if this was how it was supposed to be, and it is designed this way.  My hair kept falling out of the plates when I tried to straighten it.  While I was at Ulta, I ended up getting a Hot Tools one and I love it.  The plates are flat against each other and it's really quick to straighten my hair.",0
"Have been using this dry shampoo for months and it works fantastic. However, received my shipment 4 days ago and have used it once. The sprayer no longer works, and the can is leaking product all over and the can is over half empty. Requesting replacement. Too expensive to waste!!",0
My hair is dry so leave in conditioner is a big part of my life.  This is an all around good product.,1
The tube was split when it arrived and lost about 30% of the product into the plastic covering it.,0
I also question the authenticity of this product -- it had no smell - did nothing for volume - and the bottle is so thin that it collapses when spraying onto hair.,0
I like this product very much. I have use it for years,1
"I bought this in March of 2014, it is now December 2014 and it has completely died, after sputtering with a burning smell for the last month.  I have very short, fine hair so it gets used appx. 10 minutes a day and I clean the filters weekly.  Don't waste your money.  I've had $20 dryers last for years.  During the few short months it did work, it didn't make any noticeable change in my hair or drying time.",0
"This sunscreen protects incredibly well.  I found it through researching sunblocks, as my skin is very pale and very prone to sunburn. I don't tan. I simply get burned after relatively little time exposed to the sun. I have rosacea and this sunscreen keeps my skin a little more tolerant to breaking out.  I do prefer the gel that MDSolarSciences used to make - please bring it back!

I've been using MDSolarSciences products for several years for day-to-day use, outdoor activities, and traveling.  This product has protected me in areas with higher UV exposure (East Asia, New Zealand, Costa Rica, northern Argentina) and I live in an area with dry high heat in the summer.

This product is very expensive, but I'm willing to shell out for it because it works so well.  Brands like BananaBoat or Coppertone are a waste of money because they don't protect as well and are really hard on my skin. The high price tag is the only reason I've given the product 4 stars. I don't know that everyone needs a product like this one. For example, my partner has nicer skin that more naturally tans and never breaks out.  Aveeno sunscreen seems to be just fine for his needs.",1
"Love this dryer overall. I have hair down to shoulder blades that's straight with minimal waves. Hair is shiny and dries in less time. Wish there was another step between high and low, but still happy with it. I got a supersolano first, hated it, and am MUCH MORE pleased with this brand and model!",1
I am sending back.  Brush jas no movement.  Just noise,0
Not great for contact wearers. It smudged on the lenses and wouldn't come off.,0
Gift for some one unknown,1
"Great color! Perfectly matched my bridesmaid dress and just a gorgeous blue! I bought this to use for a wedding while pregnant and it was excellent. There was very little smell and I felt very comfortable using it. After trying it, I purchased several other colors and happily painted my nails for the rest of the pregnancy and beyond. The polish lasts well compared to other brands.",1
This was very thin and did not give any color to my nails. I actually think this product damaged my nails as they all started splitting a few days after.,0
Pevonia  Dry Skin Cleanser is a excellent product . I would recommend it to any one with dry skin.,1
"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1
"Loved the bottle, but the fragrance is so diluted that you can't smell much.
Nobody noticed or commented.
it's not bad, it's just no very good.

I loved the bottle shape, but I should have ordered the smaller one.
I'm pouring this stuff out and filling it with something else.",0
"This works pretty well on fine hair.  I initially purchased at Walgreens, but found it a bit cheaper at Amazon.",0
"I found this product to be exceptional.  Contrary to many other comments, this moisturizer does NOT become more greasy throughout the day.  This is the only foundation I have ever used that doesn't become greasy.  The tint is lighter than a regular foundation, but it is actually labeled as ""tinted moisturizer"", so that's to be expected.  I use it on a daily basis because I don't always want to look like I'm wearing a lot of makeup.  Also, this product is sheer enough to forego the obligatory blush and lipstick if you want, since it lets your natural color come through a bit.",1
Warning do not buy from this vendor. I have purchased this product for years from my hair dresser so I know what to expect. This  product is obviously watered down and diluted. Leaves hair like wire.,0
"Heard a lot about this mascara and was excited to get it from Haute Look. The narrow brush sounded perfect for precision to my sparse, short, falling out lashes. Ive been using this for over 2 mos now and have grown to really like it. If I wouldve reviewed it initially I wouldve expressed completely different feedback. It took a bit of getting used to. I had to completely change my application process. With fatter, fuller mascara brushes I always, after curling, apply to the top of my upper lashes, then underneath the top lashes while wiggling the brush to ensure they are fully coated. Then do my lower lashes lightly. I found following these steps using Eyeko LS brush resulted in a LOT of unattractive clumping. However, after some experimenting, I discovered that if I just lightly brushed only the underneath of my top lashes and lightly did the bottom lashes, I got a very nice, feathery lash while shortening my routine. You do have to be extra careful while applying bc since the bristles are further apart compared to many brushes, I do think its easy for excess to collect in between and wind up on your lashes. Overall, I really like this mascara and would repurchase. Coupled with daily use of Rapid Lash, my lashes haven't ever looked this good. Loreal Telescopic is a good alternative tho.",1
"I read the other reviews about how small this thing is, but decided to give it a try as I'm a petite woman with small hands. When it arrived I almost laughed. Indeed they are tiny, like they're made for kids. There's no way any man's hands can fit in these. I barely fit into these. That's not the only problem though. After one use, these started unraveling. After the second time, there were big gaping holes between the fingers. This product is pure junk!  What a waste of money!",0
"I'm a huge believer in the MD product used at night to grow lashes but I was very disappointed in the mascara.  Made my lashes flat immediately after curling, it flaked off really easy which hurt because I wear contacts and was definitely not even water resistant.  I work out so this was super inconvenient.",0
"This is a lightweight balm that is more like a highly hydrating cream. One small drop is all I needed to easily spread on my neck. It absorbs quickly and smells fantastic too. I don't think I have been using it long enough to see a big difference in my fine lines or maybe it is too hard to take before and after pictures of my neck close-up, but my neck does feel somewhat smoother after I use it, so I will keep using it.",1
The Paul Mitchell brand of hair brushes are no longer quality. I have switched to another brand.,0
"Honestly, I thought this was a self-tanner when I ordered it (so much for my paying close attention).  Nevertheless, I was happy that it was sunscreen.  I've not tested it's SPF, but have used it to test the smell and feel.  It smells wonderful, and I almost consider using it as perfume!  The oil sprays nicely and is not to oily.  Can't wait to use it on my upcoming river trip.",1
"Glides through hair without snagging, gets nice and hot and stays that way.  It's also nice to get two replacement springs with the iron - that is always the first thing to go on these things and then they lose all effectiveness because the jaws won't stay closed.

Swivel cord is nice too.",1
I bought this dryer several months ago and now noticed one side of the handle getting so hot it's hard to hold the handle. The warranty makes you pay for shipping to return it and include $10.00 to pay for return shipping. Not worth is since I paid between 30-40 dollars for it. Throwing it out before it catches fire!  Won't buy this brand again.,0
"I bought this to use with my dry bar hair dryer. It did not work well with that dryer...or maybe it just doesn't work well. It would get jammed on my dryer so I would feel like I was going to break the attachment to get it off. The inside of the attachment melted. Finally, it just kept smelling like burning plastic every time i used it and the blue part kept falling off so i tossed it.",0
"The results were great...initially. Once completely dry, it flakes. I scratch my scalp and it begins to snow! It does define curls, but it is not good for all hair types, such as mine. The PM leave in conditioner on the other hand is wonderful.",0
My hair some natural wave in it.  When summer comes I need something to help with the frizz.  This is PERFECT!  A little goes a long way.  Just 2 drops and I can cover my med past shoulder length hair.,1
Excellent product,1
"I have almost black hair, and shy away from white products but tried this due to others' reviews..  this one's okay but honestly, I'm back to using cornstarch instead of it.  I feel safer using it, it has no funky smell, it's a lot easier to apply (my fingertips - and then I rub it around and use a damp cloth to get some of the whiteness out) and it's much cheaper!",0
One of the  jars was glued shut and when I finally got it open it was half used!  Since I received three jars I first used the two that opened easily. Since the final one was hard to open I just got to it because it was actually glued was super glue! My husband had to use a razor to cut it open and when we opened it we found out it had already been have used. What cheaters!,0
"there is no after care customer service. the phone service at tria beauty is out, no email responses.

i would not recommend this product until their phone service is back.",0
"Unfortunately I had to return this.  The moisturizer itself felt a little thin as compared to other creamier moisturizers.  The first moment I put it on I felt something ""off.""  My skin got very red from the product, which means I was reacting to one or more of the ingredients.  The product smells like hot lather that you would smell in a barber shop when they go to shave your neck.  It is not overpowering and it does go away.  In addition to the reaction, it didn't do anything to make my pores smaller.  So, I returned it and went back to Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair.",0
i think this attachment is not necessary --- the mini NuFace can easily be used for the same purpose,0
"When I used the Clarisonic Mia for the first few times, my skin felt amazing, however, once I started using it regularly, the benefits started to diminish and I actually started to break out...really bad. Every time I use the Clarisonic I break out really bad along my chin area and various other spots...like bad, deep seemingly cystic-type blemishes that take forever to heal. I just used it for the last time last week and I've finally almost recovered from the aftermath. I see a dermatologist and have various prescriptions both orally and topically and when I break out from using the Clarisonic, the medications are rendered useless due to the severity. I just have to wait until it clears up on its own. I would not recommend this product to anyone who has any issues with acne. I don't think it diminishes the size of wrinkles or pores anymore than a baking soda exfoliation. It's way overpriced for what it does. I really, really tried to like it, but alas, our relationship is officially over.",0
"I like the compact and lightweight design. Ordered purple received turquoise.. no big deal, but if it had been Id have to have returned it. The color is on the outside of the box so Im not sure how it was mispacked. Good thing the color was essential to this order. Four star review because of the wrong color.",1
I just didn't like this as a body wash. It doesn't smell as good as the lotion. Something is lost in body wash form. I prefer their soaps -- like the new lime glycerine soap; that stuff smells wonderful.,0
Product was not a new product. Had old labeling half. Product was outside of container. Inner seal was not intact. Want money back.,0
did not buy,0
Package arrived damaged and some had leaked out. Given the cost of this item it is of significant concern.,0
This oil is simply wonderful. At the first time I used I saw the diference in my hair and my skin.,1
"As someone with adult hormonal acne, I have to say I liked this product.  It neither stung nor dried out my skin as many clearing masks tend to do to me.  It left me feeling clean and refreshed, but he jury is still out on whether or not it actually clears skin.  I think that as part of a regimen it might be beneficial, but on its own perhaps not.  The bottle is small and therefore there is not that many applications; expensive for what your getting.  But if someone is looking for an all natural mask, I think this one is worth a try.",1
"Love this color. Soft feminine. I usually use OPI, but wanted a change. I really like the Zoya nail polish. Goes on very easy and doesn't PEEL OFF!",1
"Love this spray! It really refreshes your skin! I use it all day long, anywhere i may be! I bought one for my car, my house and my gym bag! The only thing I am not a fan of is the rose petal smell. Being a guy its a little to sweet. I think a formula with more eucalyptus, chamomile or Euchinacea would smell better.",1
"Very poorly designed. The peg that holds the brush head to the base BROKE OFF. A useless, overpriced device. The customer service is as worthless as the defective, over-priced garbage toothbrush. Save your money & buy something else!",0
"I purchased this product blindly after reviewing you tube. I am very satisfied with the product! I will try some of their other products!!! Great Fragrance for Winter, Spring and Fall or in open spaces where air circulates well!",1
Love the way it feels and makes my skin look. Does not cause me to break out which I usually have an issue with other sunscreen.  My complexion is darker so the tint helps me not to have that pasty white look.  Love it!!!,1
"My son had no luck with Proactive - only worked for a a few months then right back to 'big' breakouts.  And he hated the '3 step' routine - typical teenage boy.  This is a basic wash in AM - apply the Acne Med, then wash PM and apply acne med.  This, coupled with a antibiotic prescribed by our family physician has worked wonders.  Took about 3 months, but his skin is clear and he only has an occasion breakout (nothing big) whihc is expected since he is an athlete and always sweating.  Would recommend.",1
Did nothing for my fine hair. Waste of money,0
"Like others, I was expecting a green apple scent; however, I was pleasantly surprised that the cream actually smells like lemon verbena, which is one of my favorites.
This time of year is very rough on skin so I was eager to try this. The cream is nongreasy and moisturizes my hands. I put it on at night and my hands felt very soft the next morning. And of course, the smell was lovely and not at all overpowering. The size is perfect for storing in a purse, car console or just tucked in a drawer at work.
The ingredients look very impressive (and yummy): aloe juice, apple juice, lemon juice, white grape juice. sunflower seed oil, jojoba, among others.",1
"This facial lotion is actually very thick on the face, with a strong scent and application of sun screen. Burns my eyes really badly that I need to wash them out, due to the high concentration of sun screen. I love all of their other products except this one.",0
"Bought this from Costco , eyes got more wrinkle after using it few month. I then now switch to Vine Vera age defying eye serum gel together with dark circle eye cream , wrinkle has gone after few month . It cost 170 after discount but it wort he'd it.",0
"Proraso shaving soap is a quality product that has an established name in the business. The soap loads in the brush with ease, and build a generous lather quickly. I lays a slick surface for shaving. The fragrance is that of a turn of the century Italian barber shop. I highly recommend you give it a shot. The green tub is the original formula, and will leave you feeling fresh for the morning.",1
"This is the most terrible moisturizer I've ever used. It does not rub in at all. It cakes all over your face and does not get absorbed by the skin at all - even after an 8 hour day! I don't prefer going to work looking like a ghost. Plus, my skin is breaking out more and looks more dull and tired. My skin did not like this product at all. For $45, it's definitely not worth the steep price at all. Very disappointed.",0
"I received this product promptly and was excited to try it. As you can see there are actually 4 products in this box. I have only had the products for a few weeks and have not seen a marked improvement yet but am willing to give 3 of the items a full trial and use them up before giving up. However, the jar of of COLD PLASMA is beyond using. It smells rancid and disgusting! I tried it twice thinking once it was rubbed in and the Photo Plasma placed over it that the smell would dissipate or at the very least be less noticeable. Unfortunately, the stink was all I could smell, even hours later. I will not continue using it because I cannot stomach the odor. I have no way of knowing if I just received a bad batch or if the COLD PLASMA formula just smells horrible to begin with. Whenever possible I purchase unscented facial products but I will try products that are scented if they are not grossly disagreeable. But this one just is intolerable. I will try to remember to post an update after I have used up the remainder of the other 3 items. At least they don't STINK.",0
"This foundation STINKS and I mean it smells really bad. I have used Lorac for many, many years. I always used natural performance foundation and was very happy with it. I typically get it from ULTA but they had quit selling because the Porefection was taking its place.  The Porefection covers well but doesn't stay on as good and truly smells bad! I will order the natural performance online for as long as it's available. If they ever quit making it I will just have to find a new brand because the smell of this makeup is unbearable.",0
Great smoothing serum but pills a bit under makeup!,1
love it.. really feels so nice on the skin.,1
Works great and smells good!,1
after reading all info.sounds scary and a big pain. sending back,0
Unfortunately this item was defective and I had to return it.  The on/off switch didn't work right.  It kept siwtching itself back and forth.  I am disappointed since the features looked promising.,0
Just makes my hair feel greasy.,0
not really good it doesn't last long just about 4-5 hours,1
This is the most disappointing product I've ever bought in Amazon. It does nothing to acne but made my skin scratchy and red ..... I seldom give other negative reviews. This one makes everything worse,0
Great price!!!,1
Great product !!! Been using this product for awhile and it's fatastic!!!,1
Makes my hair feel heavy... Even if I use a very small amount ...,0
"I must say I am so very disappointed in the Supersmile Whitening System Set - 3.6 & 4.2 Oz each.  I have used both faithfully, exactly as stated in the directions. I just completed using the entire contents.  I took a before & after picture, and see no difference after completion of products.  Not only did I use exactly as directed, I also brushed my teeth for twice as long as recommended, and at times, 3 times a day.  My husband & son said they see no difference what-so-ever.  For the price of these 'toothpaste'. I expected at least some good results.  I'll return to my dentists' whitening gel.  Wish I had something better to say.",0
Seems to work fine.,1
Love love love Mary Lou Manizer!  A very shimmery highlight!,1
"It seems to be working, along with the shampoo and conditioner. I have Lupus, and thinning hair is one of my symptoms, and I feel like this is one of the only thing that works thus far. Others have noticed a difference in my hair, but it did take some time. So just be willing to stick with it. It's not an overnight fix. And make sure to shade the scalp treatment bottle very well!",1
High is too high! Low is too low! Needs an in between setting!,1
"Could t get rid of my daughters cradle cap, this was magic. Plus the smell is great. My oldest has curly hair and works awesome on her.",1
I didn't like this palette. The colors were nice but didn't apply smoothly. I threw mine away.,0
"I used this color today to do my first ever at-home Shellac manicure.  I'm not a professional, but prefer doing my own nails, so I recently purchased the CND 6-bottle starter kit, a UV lamp, and an assortment of polish colors.  This color is so pretty!  I had to use 3 coats to get the coverage I wanted, but it turned out awesome.  It's a deep purplish-silver shimmer color.  I'm sure this will definately be one of my top 5 favorite colors.",1
The product is great. I didn't read/realize the size. Disappointed that I paid so much for a small bottle. This is my own fault but reviewing to warn others- this is not a full size bottle!,0
This 6.7 oz bottle of shampoo that I paid $26 for is no better than the 32 oz bottle of shampoo I pay $10 for.,0
Really really good product. I highly recommend.,1
I'm a 59 year old African American with fair skin that has darkened on my elbows. I use this exclusively for that area. This lotion has made a visible difference.,1
"I have only used it for a week.  I have noticed a difference, but not as much as I had hoped for.
I will continue to use it because I do see my crowns getting whiter.",1
The hold formulation of Eye Spackle that came in a small pot was creamier and gave far better and much longer-lasting coverage.,0
"Don't waste your time with this product, it doesn't work! I returned it for a full refund.",0
"This product is great but like the other reviewers said, it does have an oily/petroleum jelly feel to it so I would NOT reccomend this to anyone with naturally oily skin. I have used this steadily (day/night) for about 2 months and I decided to switch products and broke out within a week- needless to say I am back to this moisturizer and couldn't be happier! Its great for sensitive, dry skin and the price is perfect!",1
Have not tried it.  Too expensive.  But sounds just like J&J Lavender cornstarch that is awesome and costs just $4 for 15 oz.,0
"This perfume spray offers a fruity floral scent that is not overpowering.  A little bit goes a long way and I can still smell the remnants of it in the morning (it smells light and refreshing).  If you like Calvin Kline scents - I think you'll also like this one.  Amazon also offers a better price than most department stores.

The 4 star rating rather than the 5 is simply due to comparison to my all-time favorite scent which is no longer on the market (Fendi).  Whereas I really like Eternity Now, it hasn't surpassed by favorite perfume and for that reason I view it as a 4 star - still a wonderful scent but not my all-time favorite.",1
The cord on my previous Sam Villa straightener  broke but I found this one on Amazon & I absolutely love it!,1
Another product on the market that doesn't work.  Oh what tangled webs we weave,0
Like all cosmetics...just promises...,0
good,1
"Okay, so the reason why I didn't give a full five stars is because when I wear it, it does feel sticky, but the god news it goes away after a while. I love that it is SHEER with just a hint of colour. I sometimes want when I'm feeling sick and have to face the world that I am not the plague of death so the hint of colour is amazing. Gives just enough to add some colour to your face but not so overbearing. It smells wonderful, even though my boyfriend isn't fond of it, I love it.",1
LOVE the lightweight texture. Need to get a bigger bottle and the body sunscreen with my next order.,1
THIS A KNOCK OFF!!!! Just got it and immediately knew off the first spray it wasn't it. Went to Macy's directly after work that day and I sprayed both. The one from amazon is very musky and only lasts a couple hours. The real one is very clean and usually lasts majority of the day. First and last time I'm buying cologne online since it can't be returned.,0
"This is probably my all-time favorite mascara.  I got it as a sample through Ipsy, and fell in love with it.  It doesn't clump, it makes my lashes look big and long.  I will put on a coat or two in the morning, and then at night if I want my eyes to be more dramatic then I will apply another coat or two, without getting the spider leg eyelashes.  It washes off really easily, and if I forget at night, I do not look like a raccoon in the morning.  So win win!",1
It's a great Mascara and it last all day --  and easy to remove,1
"The ONLY reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I hate the small size.  I wish this spray wasn't so expensive for the size I want.  However, it does work great.  I have very thin stringy hair, and this is the ONLY product that allows my hair to look thicker and have added volume after blow drying.  I recommend this to everyone I know!",1
"I was extremely disappointed in this item.  It was quite small in size, unlike the previous item that I ordered, which was the shower gel. I was expecting more.  Now I know what a 1.5 oz item really looks like. TOO SMALL EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!.",0
"Love this product; however, when it arrived I placed it in my travel kit. When I went to use it, the pump is not working. Went to see if could place a return, but the window for return has recently closed. Would want to replace it as I regularly order and use this product, but defective pump is a recurring issue and have had to have replacements sent several times.",0
"The packaging that shows on the internet is the large eshampoo cream, however I received the small ones, I was disappointed",0
"I think this smells like authentic sandalwood, but I don't think that's what I want.  I think I want a pleasant smell like sandalwood.  This is very harsh, like fresh cut wood treated with lacquer or something.  The soap itself is great, but the smell is awful.  I should have believed the other reviews, but thought it was just personal taste.  I'll finish it off, as it's not a big deal to me, but i would never buy this scent again.  Previously I used Taylor of Old Bond Street, and it was much better.",0
"Works every time and great price too
Use once and you're done for the day!
Would recommended to everyone looking for a great eyelash curler",1
"Use it all the time, very peased with results for aging skin",1
Not happy . Its thick and clumpy.,0
"A really nice deep color, somewhere between dark grey and dark brown. I love it. Applies easily, dries quickly and lasts a few days,",1
Waste of money. Did not help ay all,0
"I bought this after reading stellar reviews elsewhere. It does initially leave my face with a nice matte finish, and the sun block protection is nice. The smell is nothing strong  or offensive in my opinion. However after several hours of wear this ends up making my face more oily in comparison to when I do not use it. It is not the miracle face lotion some people claim it is, atleast not with my skin type. Couple that with the steep price tag and I would say overall not a good product for the money. If this was about twenty dollars cheaper it would change my perspective a bit.",0
"It's still early but I like what I see and feel so far. A little bit goes a very long way. One little pump and it starts off as a gel and turns into a liquid that speads very easily. The fragrance is very mild and pleasant and it aborbs instantly into the skin. What I notice the most, and I wasn't expecting much, is the firmness it gave my skin from the first application. I do apply my moisturizer with SPF aftwards always and so far I like the results but as far as skin brightening or reducing fine lines and wrinkles (which I do have) I haven't noticed a significant difference yet. Maybe longer use is necessary so we'll see.",1
"Feels just like a minty Chapstick, only Chapstick is a lot less expensive. Not very emollient, wears off fast.",0
I'm not that crazy about this product. I'm really not seeing any difference with my eyes. Not sure if I would order it again,0
Great stuff but really smells like an old lady rather than a nice smell,0
"not greasy, high quality sun protection. I love it",1
"other than being a bit lighter in shade than expected, this BB Cream is great",1
"I love this oil, conveniently in a bottle with a brush, fast shipping, have seen improvement on my cuticles even after short term, will purchase again.",1
ok,1
"Omg! Im an Esthetician and I have been using Elta MD spf Tinted for the past 2 year.
Today I received my regular order for the month and I cant believe how ugly and different from all the others Ive used this is.
It leaves a very flacky look and I cant apply it.
Is this a fake???? Very disappointing",0
"It does the job, I just wish the awesome smell would stick around a little longer though!",1
"Product was not the quality I expected it to be, especially for the price!",0
I hate applying sunscreen to my face and frequently wear foundation. This is perfect to mist on my face and over my makeup. Its a very fine mist that doesnt disturb my makeup or feel heavy or sticky. Not the cheapest thing but I do feel like the bottle is large and will last me some time.,1
"I was recommended to try this curling Iron as it actually does work. I have pin straight hair and for me, curling my hair is not an option. My hair is always straight unless I get it done by the professionals. I used it for the first time this past weekend and loved the beach wave curls it gave me. Only down fall is the rotation of it can get annoying as you always need to try and find the ""go"" button, however that would not deter me from recommending it.

Great product for a reasonable price!",1
"I bought this accidentally thinking it was the replenishing mist and didn't realize until 2 days later. The mist I spray very liberally in my hair so that's what I did when using this product. I knew something was amiss because my hair felt very crunchy although it didn't look it.  All day at work people commented on how voluminous and lovely my hair looked. Now, I have naturally curly hair that is poofy and unruly. I love it but I usually don't get compliments on it. I think the key with this product is to use sparingly or perhaps on wet hair. Either way I will keep it because it does have a nice effect.",1
There is not enough scrub material in this product,0
Great price.  I will keep buying as I run out.,1
Im a hard core advocate for Grande Cosmetics love this stuff. Started using it when I got a few samples. Only reason i didn't give 5 stars is because the 1 tiny sample lasted me 3x longer than the actual tube.,1
"This is not authentic , counterfeit & watered down will damage hair. Buy only from a salon...",0
What I love about this blow dryer as a stylist is the fact that it can get really hot. And I love the concentrator attachment too. It's narrow and it stays put...it never falls off. I also like the on/off and heat setting buttons because they never get in the way. My only two complaints is that (1) it is too heavy and (2) it doesn't come with a diffuser.,1
Dried the skin under my eyes. Returning it. Won't keep it. Didn't like. Not sure why I have to type a certain amt of words to describe what I didn't like!,0
Love it,1
"Huge disappointment.  This is not the deep purple displayed on the bottle.  After 3 coats, it was a pale, see through purple.",0
"I got a fake one.
1) Smell: There is a hint of mint scent. The original has an overpowering mint scent.
2) Color: Not as blue as the original.
3) On my scalp, it did not feel minty AT ALL. I was so confused I shampooed twice, trying to see if I was feeling things correctly. As soon as I put it on my scalp, my scalp got itchy. It's been about 12hrs since I used it, and my scalp is still itchy.",0
I had hoped it would be a good moisturizer but it is not for my skin. But I love the fragrance and it is fine to use on my arms and it gives that lovely perfume.,1
Same curling wand my hair stylist uses. Gets hot and works great,1
"I bought this moisturizer at ULTA, which was recommended by staff.  I returned it after a few weeks of use.  I found it to be very greasy and it took a long time to absorb.  I finally decided to return it after swimming a few times with my kids.  The moisturizer would run into my eyes and it really burns.  That was it for me.

I instead bought Neutrogena Visibly Even.  I really am happy w/this product.  Half of the price, absorbs quickly, non greasy and smells great.",0
I am obsessed with this hair oil. Best product I've ever purchased and the only thing that has ever managed to tame my mushroom hair.,1
"Not only did I not like the feel of this primer but after using it with the NuFace Toner, you have to wash it off.  An extra step!  Not good for sensitive skin.  So I bought the CVS oil-free moisturizer and I love the way it works with the NuFace Toner.  Plus, no breakouts!  You can also buy Neutrogena oil-free moisturizer but the CVS brand is cheaper and works just as good if not better.",0
Gave me a rash.,0
"I have color-treated hair, which requires a lot of product to style it. I unfortunately also have oily hair. I have tried shampoos from Kerastase to Aveda to drugstore brand in search of the best clarifier. Yes, I could use vinegar and smell like eau de vinegar or I could use this great product. Pureology is extremely strong- it cleans it all! Yet it's safe to use on my color-treated hair. As with any Pureology product, you only need a small amount. It has a fresh, herbal scent. And best of all- it's sulfate free! For me this is huge because my scalp itches like crazy with sulfates. I use this once per week, and it lasted me 6 mos. I'll never go without it. Pureology does things right.",1
"I've tried other dry shampoos, and they don't compare! No sticky residue, easy to apply and smells refreshing!",1
"This makeup brush is long, 6.5 inches, and just fits in my makeup kit. The bristles are soft, rounded and open, not dense. The brush picks up blush lightly for nuanced shading. I like the ergonomic handle. It's a wide grip made from silicon-like material that is ridged and comfortable in the hand. The only thing I would say is that you need to have powder in a good-sized compact, because the brush is wide, an inch across, and tapered, so that you'll only pick up powder at the tip if you have a small compact.",1
"This is a pretty nice concealer from my favorite skin care company. Although the dark beige is too dark for my skin, it goes on easily and smoothly, and looks pretty good if you buff out the edges. My skin is oily, so it doesn't last all day, but that's not really the fault of the concealer.

What I don't like is the brush. It works fine, and is actually convenient, but seems so unsanitary to me. Every time you use it, you'll be picking up bacteria from your skin. Even if you wash it, you can't do a thorough job without getting water up in the pen itself.  If I was going to continue using it (and I would, if it was the right color), I would dispense some onto my finger and use it from there. I wouldn't touch the brush to my face.",1
It will take consistent use to actually prove to be handy for any individual.,1
"sure it smells nice, but the smell doesn't last long.
for the price i paid, i would rather get something else.",0
"Cakey, doesn't doesn't blend into skin. It does stay on and not rub off
On clothes and people. Again it just sits on skin and it looks like you have foundation on.",0
"The product itself is great, but the nozzle top broke after the first week.  I now have a full can of product that I cannot use.",0
It was a great product and it had an even better price.,1
"My wavy, spirally hair is fairly fine. I've used other Ouidad products and liked them, but this spray really does nothing at all, not even de-tangle my hair.  If anything, my hair is unusually frizzy after using this product.",0
"I love this!  First off, the smell is not that bad.  I don't know if it depends on the bottle or what.  But, I have no issues with it.  It does smell lemony when I first put it on, but after 5 minutes, I don't smell it anymore.  I use it at night before bed and then do some touch ups in the AM with it.  So far, I can go a couple days without washing.  I only wash my hair on Saturdays and Wednesdays now.  I find the more product I use during the day, the better this works.  It also works better as the days go by.",1
"I like this bronzer. At first it was way too dark, especially, if you don't tap it on your hand first, but then I got a better brush and blending became super easy, and it looks good and natural. Great for contouring and it would fit most skin tones.",1
This is the best eyeshadow I have ever bought.  I have been wearing it for several years and it is a great color on blue eyed gals.  Good quality too.  I put Urban Decays eyeshadow base on first and then the eyeshadow and it has great staying power.,1
Barely any color,0
"Product is very good for exfoliating and giving your skin a renewed smooth look and feel.  It has helped over the years to make my keratosis pilaris disappear.  Doctors say that you can't get rid of KP, but this really is making it disappear.  It took a long time though to where there is basically very little KP on the skin on my legs below my knees.  I started out with the kit that contains the exfoliating shower gel.  Then I moved to this product only and the results for your skin overall even if you don't have KP will be noticeable if you stick with it.  One star missing because the pump is problematic.  It stops working mysteriously in all the bottles I've ordered.  Don't know why this product has gone up $20, a 60% increase, but I wouldn't buy again from this seller for that price or any seller for that price.  New products are coming out there that are better priced and I'll have to shop around now for a fair market price.",1
"I am going to start by saying, I love how soft & silky the hand cream & daily moisturizer made my skin feel the first time I tried it & it smells amazing. BUT the 2nd time I used the hand cream, I guess I touched my face before it soaked in & dried completely, and It broke me out with horrible rash all over my face! :( I'm not sure what ingredient within the product triggered the reaction because I have no known allergies & have never broken out from anything :/ I was completely shocked & kind of upset because one of the biggest claims of this product is that they are all ""approved for sensitive skin""... Now I am not saying this will happen to you, but it could, that's why I am sharing my personal experience with this product. After using the Hand cream and daily moisturizer, I decided not to even attempt to apply the mud mask or velvet cream wash to my skin, so I cannot truthfully give you a review about those specific products in this set, but I am sharing what I personally bought, tried, and my experience with it.... Ok, so to sum it up, this set has a very nice scent to it, it claims to have made all it's products with Dead Sea Minerals which has been proven to have healing effects to the skin, help with stress, etc. If you do your research you will find that the dead Sea is amazing & people travel all over the world to bathe in it's waters/ soak in it's muds, although I am not sure how much of these minerals are included in these products, the minerals have proved themselves pretty amazing :)  This travel size kit is pretty pricey as with all ""AHAVA"" products, these specific bottles in this set are really tiny, and there is a ingredient in these products that may trigger an allergic reaction. I had a horrible experience with these products and I will not be purchasing another AHAVA product so long as I live, nor would I ever suggest their products for anyone to buy. BUT I'm sure there are people out there who love their products and use them everyday, So I wouldn't solely judge their products on my review alone. You may have a totally different experience with AHAVA all together, this is just what happened to me & I felt the need to share. Thanks for reading & good luck! :)",0
If I could give it a zero I would! Worst iron I have ever purchased not to mention the most expensive! I have had it for 5 months and poof it does not work!,0
"I have been shaving with a single blade 'safety' razor for some time and have not been able to get the great shave people seem to claim such a razor gives, until l tried this magic shaving oil. The difference with/without this oil is amazing, your skin feels smooth and it does reduce irritation, especially under the chin where I used to get a lot of razor burn. I paired this with a shaving soap but I could see using just the oil to shave off a day's growth. Buy it, you will like it.",1
I use it as my nightly moisturizer and really like it.  It does not cause my skin  to break out as other products have.,1
I've owned this same model for ten years and it finally died.  This same curling iron doesn't heat up all the way even on max temperature.  I missed the return window so stuck now.,0
Fragrance lasts only as long as the spray coming out of the bottle. Not authentic/not same as the one I purchased in store/Barneys.,0
Highly recommend these products and cleared my face up in just a few days !,1
"I buy a product if I like the air as a male walks by.  Great. Not heavy, fresh and very manly.",1
Irritated my eyes.,0
My face and neck broke out in a rash after use.,0
"I found this a little too heavy for my purposes.  I have mild rosacea, but I'm past 50 so this looked a little to heavy for me.",0
"I am now ordering a second one of these curling irons because I never want to go back to the old, metal curling irons that burn or dry out my limp, fine, straight hair.  Since using this iron, I no longer find broken hairs on my bathroom counter.  I am buying this second one as a back up because I have to curl my hair dailly for work and can't take a chance on not having this iron when my first one finally burns out.",1
Always use the iron curler!,1
"I have been using this product since the late 70's when I was in Paris.  If you are looking for a 'fresh scent', this one is for you.",1
Does not have the original cap and seal was broken.  The cap is clear. The date on the back says 2012 and I don't know if that means anything.  Would not recommend.,0
"Hate hate hate!
Was told to buy this, works just like my 20 dollar Walmart one. Now I'm out money
Wish I could return this over priced junk",0
Not worth the ,0
Has a weird smell. It didn't work for back acne. I noticed better results with St Ives,0
"I'm in the process of returning this. It is like water. Serum to me is supposed to have some consistency.  This literally ran down my hand. I felt like I was going to waste more of the product than what was actually making it on to my skin. It seemed sticky too!? I also noticed after the second use that my skin seemed blotchy, like it was tinted or something. For the amount that I paid I expected way more than this.

On another note I did ask others that had purchased the product if this is what it was supposed to be like. The few people that answered were identical responses that I had already read when others asked about the quality of the serum...just seemed weird to me.",0
"Pictures taken 24 hours after doing my nails with this product.  My right hand (my dominant hand) is much worse, so I included both hands.  I love OPI, but save your money on this one!  You can have mine for free... My nail polish usually lasts much longer than a day!!  I'm surprised at how many positive reviews there are.  I read the instructions and followed them.  They suggest using this first, then a base coat, then polish (two coats), then top coat... That's what I did... Also, the brush is strangely small and ineffective as well.",0
I quit buying this product because it would stop working after using it about 10 times.  I would try to get it to work but it just would not come out.  I have ordered this product more times than I should have.  I liked the way it went on the first 5 or so times.,1
"I really like the adjustable heat settings, but my power switch quit working after about a year. The curling iron itself still works great, I just can't turn it off and have to unplug it.",1
Love this cleanser my face is very oiley but this cleanser cleans my face without over drying it..I use this along with the face cream and the primer all great products,1
too much $ and I didn't notice a difference.,0
Not worth it!  I received this and immediately returned it the next day without even using it.  My expectations for a $20 glove was that it was going to be more high tech than a piece of sheer fabric sewn into a glove.  I could have my mom sew me one of these for a lot cheaper,0
"I love the product.

The item did not arrive in it's original packaging, there was no box (and I have bought other products from this line brand new) instead it was just bubble wrapped.  Plus it did not have the white cover for the tip (in order to stop the product from spilling).  I'm guessing it was used.",0
"This bronzer has a silky feel and is pigmented, as I've come to expect from the Lorac brand. The powder is finely milled and does not feel dry to the touch.  The color is not too orange, but is quite light compared to other bronzers in my collection.  Also, while the bronzer is supposed to be matte, there is a slight sheen to it.  I'd call it more of a satin look rather than a true matte.  Personally I prefer the slight sheen because it looks more natural than a true matte. I have a medium skin tone and I am currently tan.  I am wearing Makeup Forever Mat Velvet + Foundation in #53 (perfect match) at the moment.  The bronzer doesn't really show up on my skin very well.  I can use it to slightly warm up my face, but it is not usable as a contour.

I have attached a picture of the bronzer swatched on the underside of my arm in comparison with two other bronzers in my collection.

Left: Too Faced Chocolate Soleil (Matte)
Middle: Lorac Tantalizer Baked Bronzer in Matte Tan
Right: Mac Refined Golden Bronzer (has some glitter particles)

As you can see,the bronzer is lighter than both of those.  Also you can pick up the slight sheen.  I didn't photograph it, but it is also significantly lighter than Too Faced Sun Bunny bronzer.  I will update this when I have a chance to compare to a few other popular bronzers.  I really can't comment on lasting power.  It doesn't really show up on my skin, beyond a slight warming effect.  That said, I got compliments on my nice tan when I wore it, so while I can't use it for contouring, the subtle effect is noticeable to others. :)

The packaging is very bulky.  The top is see through and it slides to the side to allow access to the bronzer.  Underneath, there is a compartment with a brush.  The brush is flat and good quality.  It is really good for applying the powder for contouring purposes.  I think you would still want a fluffy brush to blend if you are fair, but I think the brush is good for application.  In fact, I am taking it out of the compact to use with bronzers that are better suited to my skin tone for contouring.  There is a nice mirror at the bottom, although I don't love having to constantly flip between the bottom and the top to apply the bronzer while also using the mirror.  The packaging is also REALLY bulky.  Because of the brush compartment, it is very thick, so it isn't great for travel.  Also, I don't really love how both the top and brush compartment slide out.  I prefer more traditional compacts with the mirror inside the compact.",1
The microzeolite ingredient in this product is an aluminumsilicate even though the claim no aluminum... this is basically cat litter.  [...],0
good,1
"I have dry, processed hair that is curly. This conditioner made my hair feel heavy and course. The deepshine oil product was great so I expected more from this conditioner",0
I use with a brush and nice coverage. I do find that it doesn't last all day however. I normally apply mineral makeup after this concealer. Blends well.,1
I have rosacea with frequent flushing that can become very painful. This product often reduces the flushing and pain. I use it daily and have noticed a reduction in redness.,1
my favorite hair product of all time!,1
My sensitive skin drinks this up & glows! What a find!!,1
Slow drying.,0
Protects the hair!,1
I have psoriasis and I can live without cortisone creams since I discovered Avene Akerat smoothing exfoliating cream. I highly  recommend this cream to everybody with psoriasis.,1
"It works to create volume and enhance my daughters curls, but it won't stay on my Babyliss Nano Titanium Pro Portofino Hair Dryer. When it falls off my daughter gets burned. I wish it would stay on and it would be a 5/5 or 10/10...It's almost pointless if it doesn't stay on.",0
Could anyone one tell me what is the input voltage for this device,0
"I've been using this miracle product for over a year now, and it's amazing! They cut down the drying time drastically and have saved my manicures. One product lasts for around three months, so it's definitely worth it. It's also helpful for painting little girl's nails- I can paint their nails and have them dry quickly and not have to worry about nail polish getting all over. I highly recommend!",1
"Smells amazing. My hair may be a little too oily for the amount of moisture this conditioner has, but I love the smell!",1
this is really a very pale peachy color that looks like little kids pretend polish on my nails.  Thought it was more salmony-coral.,0
"I've always like this brand, and this product definitely met expectations. Some people seem to be surprised by the fact that it's travel sized but that information is clearly stated (plus if you know how much Ahava costs you would probably realize this isn't a full size product). Personally I liked buying the travel size first as a tester. I have oily/combination skin and am prone to breakouts, and this is a great winter moisturizer when I'm a little dryer than usual. Still feels relatively light and absorbs easily, doesn't leave any residue behind which my current Origins product does. Very happy with the product and will purchase again.",1
This just made my hair feel dirty and didn't add too much texture or help with anything.,0
It leaks around the applicator.,0
"This would be a fantastic oil for your face if it wasn't so heavily scented (or if it was fragrance free). When I tried to use it on my sensitive facial skin, I had a slight reaction (a burning sensation followed by redness) and had to wash it off. However, when I used it on my body, it was just fine. I enjoyed very soft, supple skin. It absorbs almost immediately, so you don't have to wait long to get dressed.  I have also used just a few drops on my hair ends to help manage fly-aways and prevent split ends. The fragrance itself isn't bad (it is a tropical floral with hints of neroli), it's just a bit too heavy for my taste. Wish it came in a lightly scented version.

It is a really nice dry oil, but if you do suffer from sensitive skin (as I do), keep in mind that the fragrance might cause a reaction, particularly on your face.",1
"My dermatologist recommended this brand of face wash. I actually usually order the exfoliating body wash, but decided to give this one a try. There isn't anything wrong with it, but giving one less star because it just doesn't make my face feel as clean as the exfoliating one. Facial products are so hard to rate as everyone reacts different to them but I recommend this brand overall.",1
"Product is old or counterfeit. It does not smell like it should, and it has the wrong consistency.",0
The bottle cap is broken when I receive it. everything else is perfectly fine.,1
Not true to color! Or even close! It's the same color as a concrete driveway.,0
Color nothing like what us shown. The picture showing the grannies nails are not the color that was sent. DISSATISFIED AND DISAPPOINTED.,0
WORKS SLOWLY.,1
Easy application with a foundation brush. Covers fairly well. I have multiple age spots and this foundation lightens them but not total coverage. It doesn't feel greasy or thick.,1
"Shade range is awful. Sand is very fair despite being the medium shade...I'm not even that tan my skin tone is a lighter-medium, but sand is much too light. I would consider purchasing Tan but I do not like the formulation. Im going to stick to my Jane Iredale Dream Tint. The product  doesn't seems to dry down and constantly slips around on my face. It smells like fruit loops which is nice and its not a complete miss just not for me hence the 3 stars. keep at juice beauty love yall lol",0
THIS SOAP SMELLS GOOD AND LEAVES YOUR SKIN SO SOFT. THE BAR OF SOAP IS REALLY BIG. GREAT PRICE TOO.,1
"Review based on comments from my wife.

She's quite happy with the product. Coverage is very good. Because it's really quite opaque instead of having a more natural translucence, it can have a tendency to look a little bit ""racoony"" when used around the eyes (it also tends to go on a bit thickly if you aren't careful with the application.)  The opaqueness can help, but it

It lasts well, benefiting perhaps from 1 ""refresh"" during a day (although you can tough it out, too!).",1
I was SO pumped to get this mascara based on all the reviews! I'm totally bummed. The mascara clumps some when putting it on and by midafternoon it's flaked all over my face! I can't even get a full days wear out of it. Not worth the 23 dollar price tag at all. Not buying it again and don't recommend.,0
Great price! Better than Sephora. Great product.  Will purchase again.,1
This is one of the only sunscreens that works and doesn't make my face break out.,1
My daughter has been using this foundation for a while and it covers well and makes her skin look flawless.  It was delivered in a timely manner.,1
"Just ok, doesn't seem to remove oil much, product is somewhat oily.",0
Ordered 3 cans - all three stopped spraying well before empty - THESE MUST BE SECONDS DON'T BUY THEM,0
Very nice,1
"These rollers are too heavy and get too hot, they burned my head!  I much prefer my Conair travel set of five rollers!",0
"Wonderful !  I bought this after having recieved a free sample and I have to say it's well worth the investment.  The color is so rich and long lasting, I am a STILA fan for life now.",1
"It works well, but it takes FOREVER to apply!  It only covers one tiny little 1/4 of an inch of space at a time.  If you need to touch up grey roots in your part, definitely get the spray-on color.  Plus, the spray is less expensive.",0
"Can't believe this over hyped product! It's actually the worst lip balm that I've ever tried. It does not moisturise AT ALL. I've used it as a nightly lip treatment and an everyday balm. IT DOES NOTHING. If anything, it leaves my lips drier than before.",0
"I don't know why anyone likes these. It is a lousy shave, dangerous to use, very irritating and takes forever. Anyone who says these are better than disposable cartridges is lying or has alligator skin. For any normal guy, these are outdated, obsolete, overpriced and I'm sorry I bought it.",0
"I've been using this for years and I will use this micellar lotion as long as they produce it. It does its job and smells lovely. A small amount is enough to clear the hardiest makeup residue. The only bad thing I can think off is that my skin is super oily and gross the morning after. To be fair, however, I could probably just use a toner to avoid that.",1
"This appears to be yet another product with a celebrity name that costs more than many products but doesn't deliver meaningful results.  I haven't really been able to notice any difference in the appearance of my face using this product, but it does feel extremely silky going on in a way that other products haven't felt on my skin. I'll probably use it if I run out of other products just to keep my skin treated and because it feels nice, but I certainly wouldn't purchase it.",0
"I so wanted to like this shampoo, but it just left my hair greasy each time. Tried it for a month, hoping that my hair just needed to get used to it. Washed every other day and still - blech. Doesn't work for me (fine, straight hair).",0
Good.,1
Ahava is an excellent and reliable brand.  This mud soap leaves oily skin clean and clear.  I definitely recommend it.,1
"Disappointed in the fact that it isn't actual OPI as you can tell by the difference in the appearance of the brand name. The constisydncy of the polish is very runny and watery. Unable to return or get a refund. Color is similar, but wasn't a fan of how it looked.",0
good,1
Smells good!,1
spent an extra 10 dollars and got this baby.. it is wonderful!  my hair dried so fast and I'm impressed!,1
"So I love essie and the color was rich and beautiful, though the picture is not really what it looks like in person. The color is more of a pink, then light coral. It took almost three weeks to be delivered.",1
"Until recently I didn't realize the skin ""irritation"" I have been experiencing for years on my legs and arms actually had a name and possible treatment! I've been using the Glytone KP kit for just under 3 weeks now and have started seeing results! My upper arms have a few small bumps but overall are completely smooth and free of redness. My upper right thigh is almost completely clear and smooth while my left one (the one that has been affected the most) has shown signs of improvement and I have high hopes that continued treatment will clear up that area as well. Some cons to the actual product - the scent of the wash is less than desirable but  it's not meant to be a fruity tooty wash so I can get past that but just something others may find helpful. The lotion is extremely thick and a little goes a long way once you can get it to spread.",1
"Thickest, non-greasy hair wax I could get my hands on. I was very satisfied. Worth the $22 because it is quality.",1
"So so so disappointed with this product. I read all the reviews about how insanely hot this tool gets, and figured I may have finally found a curling iron that can handle my thick hair. WRONG! This tool doesn't get nearly hot enough. I have thick dark hair, but it's not nearly as thick as some of my Asian friends (I'm white). This will give my hair a slight curl, which falls within the hour and leaves me with really limp and sad locks. I might look into the return policy because I wanted to give it a while to see if it got better but it hasn't. This was a waste of my money.",0
"After using this products, I start breaking out with small acne and reddness. I have combination skin. After using it, i felt my skin is very sticky.",0
"I don't know how good this is since I only used it once, but this product doesn't have a clear instructions for use. I had to go online and try to find a youtube video or try to read all the reviews to figure out how to use it properly. It says use it on the clean scalp, but should I dry my hair first or use it on damp scalp? It didn't say how to open the vial, I red one of the reviews to figured it out. After I applied the plastic part to the vial, I was afraid to break the glass, so I didn't press too hard, after 2 drops on my scalp the rest was on my face and neck. I wasted one vial just like that. I opened the second vial, and pressed harder this time, I heard ""click"". I thought it's secured on the vial, but only half way done, the glass vial fell from the plastic part and droped on my counter broke into pieces. I wasted another vial. I gave up!",0
"This is my first time to use Wen.  It works as well as other cleansing conditioners, but not worth the extra expense.",1

perfect!,1
"***UPDATE***
This is by far THE WORST product I have ever used on my nails. Here I thought Ill get a break from nail polish and go natural.. After 5 Days my nails started to split and break. I had long, strong, beautiful nails that are all now breaking. I am so upset and disappointed! Now I have to pay for a manicure to get them professionally cut down (they haven't been short in years!!!) and reshaped. Even my thumbnails broke which NEVER break. This zoya system softened and weakened my nails. I am so disappointed.


Takes a very long time to dry. It does last forever though. I do not use the white tip applicator and added the lavender base. I do not see a huge difference in nail health/appearance.",0
Works fine but not as good as my chi.,1
returned it,0
"I was not expecting miracles. I expected something along the lines of either longer, fuller, or darker lashes. I used this product strictly as directed and got none of the above results. My lashes are still blonde and sparse. At the least I imagined that for nearly $40 I might get SOME results.... Would not recommend.",0
"The soap burns the baby's eyes, also its not very moisturizing.",0
I tried this product for 90 days and did not see any difference whatsoever.  It actually left scratches on my face.  I do not recommend it at all.,0
This is NOT a cleanser... not even close.  I was looking for a cleanser.  This might be a toner but I did not want a toner and I do not use toner.,0
"Delivered 1/2 full, not 2.5 oz as purchased",0
Great,1
Broke after only a year of use...one of the buttons came off and I was not able to repair it.,1
this is my third  time buying this product. the only downside is that if you do not keep the filter clean  the  brush overheats and cuts out.. you have to wait for it to cool down.. I wish they made it with a  filter that pulls out so that you can clean it.. but still and excellant product.. this company are great .. the brush almost arrived before I ordered it they were so fast..,1
A bit short for my hands but one of my favorite DE razors,1
Fantastic bliss product.,1
"I first ordered this product from Sephora for $60 a bottle. I ordered it because I was getting a tingly, sore sensation on the top of my head and my hair was falling out very rapidly. Once I began taking the supplement, within a week the tingly sensation went away and after about a month, I could wash/brush my hair without any falling out. I couldn't have been happier - if it wasn't for the price. I did a little research and was excited to see that I could get the same product on Amazon for HALF the cost of getting it at Sephora. So I ordered it. When I received it, I was immediately suspicious because - get this - the batch ID was very neatly cut out of the label with a razor blade. I thought maybe it was due to a recall, so I did some research and couldn't find any recalls listed for this product. The cap seemed to be untampered with, though, so I reluctantly decided to give the supplement a try, regardless of the shady labeling. Within two weeks, the sensation started to return, and now a month later, my hair is falling back out. I don't want to have to go to the trouble of returning it, so I am out $30 and will have to start at square one on my hair.

Don't get me wrong with the one star review, Phyto Phytophanere DOES work, but I DO NOT RECOMMEND purchasing it on Amazon. If you're having the same trouble as I am, order it from a reputable dealer like Sephora or Ulta. Trust me, it's worth the extra money to KEEP YOUR HAIR.",0
Bogus product. This is not really Nectifirm and it does not work at all. I would recommend you not buy this product.,0
I was surprised to receive RED nailpolish. This picture is deceiving. I was expecting a pink color. It shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate.,0
"Not at all what I expected, for me does not work, my face looks worse than before. I will never order again this brand.",0
"I've tried dozens of curl creams and products and this is my favorite by far. It leaves my naturally curly hair feeling soft and controlled while really helping fight the frizz. When I first switched to this product, my coworkers all commented on how much more controlled my curls are, and how soft my hair has gotten. My curls are now nice spirals",1
Smells like it's gone bad.,0
"This is a great product, but I am both saddened and amazed at the reduced size of the bottle.  This container of ""cuticle-erasing-wonder-lotion"" has now been reduced to half its volume, and the size of the cap is now equal to the size of the actual product.  Sorry, Butter...not ordering again.  Your packaging is lovely, but I don't appreciate being scammed. I give Amazon 4 stars for their awesome service.  Butter, well, good luck.",1
"I know alot of people like this product. I purchased it because of its great reviews. I had high hopes for it but unfortunately it broke me out. I really wanted to love this serum i tried it so many ways with so many different products but it just didn't work for me. I have acne prone, sensitive & oily skin. I think it will work great for people with dry skin.",0
Unfortunately this item was defective and I had to return it.  The on/off switch didn't work right.  It kept siwtching itself back and forth.  I am disappointed since the features looked promising.,0
"I like this curling iron. I have owned several of them. The one complaint I have is that the spring/hinge wears out so fast. The curling iron comes with an extra hinge but after having mine for a few months it is squeaking. I can buy the springs for cheap at a hair store, so not a big deal. I just wish they made that part a little more durable.",1
"I mean see the picture; it's disgusting , product is half missing and completely ruined.",0
"The nail polish has a nice consistency and I appreciate that it is non-toxic, which was the main reason I purchased it. However, it has proven to be ineffective, as it chipped and peeled off within a day of use.",0
The color is nothing like what it shown. It's more of a light pixie pink color. Apparently the seller has no clue how the match up the correct colors with the correct pictures. When I have them one star they messaged me and asked me to remove my post. They even went as far as to offer me a free polish of my choice to remove it. I chose not to because i would more than likely not get the right color anyways.,0
"Love this cream!  I really started to see a difference about a week after I started using it.  My friends have even noticed the difference.  The skin on the back of my hands appear to be smoother and less ""wrinkly"".  I use it twice a day, and will continue to do so",1
"Update:

After doing 5 full treatments on level 5 with a significant amount of pain, even after numbing cream, it just didn't work that well. About 3 weeks after what I thought would be my final treatment the hair started growing back and at this point there's hardly any difference between the hair growth I had before and what I have now. At best I can say it's not as thick or dark... but it's still there and it's stubble-y after only day. :(

I'm giving it 3 stars because I'm not finished trying it yet.

The device says for best results use on level 5 every 2 weeks for 5 sessions for best results.

After 4 sessions on level 3 (the highest I was able to tolerate at first) and 2 sessions on level 4/5 I am starting to see a good reduction in growth, but not really what I was expecting. My underarms still appear stubbly even after 1 day, even though the hair is significantly slower to grow and definitely thinner.

My story: I'm light skinned, dark hair- Spanish & Italian.

I tried watching the instructional videos on Tria's website before I got started. The website, even though I created an account and logged my serial number from the device, would not allow me to watch - I kept getting an error message about only authorized users could view or something like that. So I went to youtube and found some videos there.

The women on youtube seemed to be able to handle level 5 on their underarms with a manageable amount of pain. I think it just comes down to personal pain tolerance. I happen to think I can actually handle a good amount of pain- but for some reason not this type of pain! I equate this feeling to an electric shock or being burned. It also gives me anxiety because each time I set the device down on my skin, the pain is different, set it down once, no pain, move over a quarter of an inch and I'm jumping up and down in pain. I was hoping that as the device started working I could up the levels. But even after 4 treatments on level 3, I couldn't up it without numbing cream.

I did some testing on my legs, arms, underams and face. The pain is bearable between my eyebrows and on my upper lip.

Since I wasn't seeing the hair growth reduction that I'd hoped for, I purchased prescription strength skin numbing cream called Numbskin. This has helped and I'm able to use the device on level 5 now- but it still hurts! It's still pretty hard to get through a full session on level 5 and in fact I did turn it down to 4 a couple of times.

Something else to note, I originally purchased this to remove facial hair but most of my facial hair is peach fuzz. This will not do a thing for peach fuzz. You have to have dark hair on light skin to get results. I also tried using this on my knees, not too painful at all, but I don't think the hair there is dark enough for it to work on. On my lower legs it's just too painful and I quit after one session. I'll try using the numbing cream- but covering that amount of skin with the small tubes of cream would be an investment in itself.

Big note and I'm super surprised I didn't hear more about this in the reviews. I have a 25 year old tattoo, my very first one, on my lower leg. I used the Tria on it, not thinking much about it and it burned and blistered me. I think it may be the old ink since I didn't hear any other complaints and I'm positive that others are using this on their tattoos. So, if you have older tattoos proceed with serious caution.",0
"If you have acne prone skin and its dry do not even bother with any kind of lotion oil free or not. I use every BOC product multiple times daily and they all work better for my skin then products my derm gives me. I had this sitting in a drawer not even opened yet since I bought it for the winter when I get dry skin and now its winter time. I pulled this out rubbed on my clean washed and acne free face, the next day BOOM! Small white-heads everywhere at least 10 or more, and a fair amount of blemishes. I will forgive baxter for this products since the only reason my face was clear to begin with was daily use of there skin toner, and facial scrub. If your like me acne prone and have dry skin I would recomend using aftershave, even if you do not shave. Of course my recomendation is Baxters after shave balm.",0
"The bottle arrived opened, not sealed. Returned immediately.",0

"OMG, this has been a lifesaver for my sparse eyebrows!!!!  Goes on so smooth, so perfect and it stays all day.  I bought the light color for my blonde hair and it's awesome.  Best product I own in my entire makeup bag... my favorite because it really allows me to transform my brows exactly how I want them to look.",1
What an amazing cologne!  The scent is unique and very masculine.  I have gotten so many compliments!,1
"i bought this for 2 months only and it already broke. what a piece of junk! it was pretty good in the beginning, really strong but then it just started getting weaker. I must say, it was pretty heavy to lift up. one day the thing just stopped working, and only a few wisps of smoke came out. i thought it had caught on fire. crappy! do not buy, it is a waste of your money!",0
"A good product. I tried to write a review on the Derma Doctor site. They wouldn't let me; so I am going to try to post a review on this site.  As I said above, the product is very good but here is the problem: The last time I received this, the jar was tiny! What use to last 3 months won't even last a month now. I have been using CCC for 7+ years. This last tiny jar had big air bubbles in it. I tried to write this on their site and they wouldn't post it. This makes me think they are only posting the reviews that give CCC a good rating.",0
Messy setting powder for the foundation. Very messy. Wear a robe.,0
"I am 36 years old and have a fair amount of uneven coloration on my face thanks to years of acne scars.  My forehead and upper cheeks are often dry, to the point of flaky in the winter, while my chin, jawline & lower cheeks are oily and prone to breaking out.

I had really hoped for some great results with this system - reduced flakiness and breakouts in the respectively prone areas, and perhaps a reduction in the acne scar coloration.  I used this machine 3x a week for a little over 2 months.

At first I thought I was noticing a change, as my skin did feel smoother with fewer breakouts.  However, that only lasted about 3 weeks.  The flakiness on my forehead actually worsened and I had to stop using the system in that area altogether.  I saw no visible change in wrinkles & expression lines.

The machine's tips wore down within 4-6 weeks (one of them was worn out within 3 weeks), which was very disappointing because they cost $15-20 each to replace.  For the cost of this system, I would have thought the tips would have been longer lasting.  Realizing the consumable cost made this system a money pit for me.

I also found it difficult to get adequate suction on quite a few areas of my face without the tip popping off the skin as I moved it along.  I don't know if it's the particular contours of my face structure or what, but even with trying the different tips and suction levels, I struggled to maintain suction while moving across my forehead, temples, nose, and jawline.  After several passes with continual suction releases, I would finally give up on these areas.

I experienced very little long lasting benefit from using this system.  I don't plan on continuing to use it, nor would I recommend it for those with skin issues like mine.",0
"The two browns were not quite what I expected, but it still looks great. I love theBalm products.",1
I have hard to curl lashes so I have been trying everything. This one did not work for me at all. The Japonusque pink curler is the best for me. I didn't realize how good it was until I tried this!@,0
"I've been using La Roche-Posay products for about the last 5 years, and its one of the most trusted brands I use daily. I started using this product about 2 months ago, and wanted to wait to give it a review to see the effects.

I am 25 years old, with combination skin. I was using Laneige water bank moisture cream previously for about a year, I had no major side effects from this product until I re-located to a warmer climate. I started noticing my face was becoming oily quickly, particularly my T-zone and began seeing tiny breakouts around my chin and mouth. I always do a ton of research on any new products I use on my face, I was looking for something hydrating, light and something that would not cause irritations.

I started using this product and within a week I noticed my skin was much softer, breakouts were less noticeable and less oily in my problem areas. Now I use several products along with this lotion plus facials 2x a week, my clarisonic, and exfoliating. No product is going to be an all-in-one and help all your concerns but finding the products that work together to help even out your skin tone, soothe irritations and control breakouts/oil is my main goal when looking for new products. I will continue to use this product. I've used one, sometimes 1 1/2 pumps every morning for the last two months and I still have another month of product left in the bottle. I highly recommend this product.",1
"Nice tan but turned my clothes orange or red, especially white clothes. It's hard to wash it off from clothing. Stays in for a while in skin but you need to apply everyday. After a while it will start to come off and you will look like there is something wrong with your skin",0
Came with conditioner all over it.  Turns the pump leaks!  Works okay on my hair.,0
Love the smell and the way it tames the fizzy ends of my hair,1
"I have owned both Solano and Elchin professional hairdryers for over 20 years.  They are still made well and very powerful.  My only minor complaint is that this hairdryer does not get as hot as I'd like.  I use the low speed and high heat setting but it is cooler that I'd like and than in previous models.  However, I'm still pleased in general.",1
"Same head design as 34c. Only difference is weight distribution and 2 piece (34c) vs 3 piece (this product).
Top with Astra blades.",1
Not as good as OPI,0
"Pros;
Curled great
Perfect size

Cons;
Spring kept coming off (put a new spring on, same thing)
Hair got caught in spring (a lot)
Smoked more often than not (and that was on low heat)
Sometimes heating element would stay on high even though I had it set on low

All in all, I won't be buying this product again. Talked to a friend, who is a hairdresser, she had the same problems. I don't know if its hot tools or just this size, but for that price, I don't want to find out. I paid over $40 for mine because all the reviews were positive. I was very disappointed.",0
As described.,1
"I enjoy the beard wash and the brush that came with this product. However, the beard wash comes in the dumbest container that leaks all over the place. It seemed that every time I closed the lid, more of the wash would leak out in to the cap.

I'm not a big fan of their beard control product. Before receiving it, I thought that it would be more comparable to a oil or balm. In my opinion, it has nutrients like an oil or a balm, but it acts as more of a gel for your beard. It leaves your beard with a harder consistency like if  you would apply gel to your hair. Once again, my opinion.",0
"smells really good, is to expensive for my budget, but it definitely love hove the citrus smells stays with you for a long time.",1
This Natura Bisse cleans the face well and is gentle and non-irritating.  It works well if you massage just a little onto a wet face with your fingers.  It works even better if you have one of those battery charged brush.  Its very gentle for the eye area which I always worry about.  Its almost fragrance free  just a little fresh background. When its rinsed off your skin feels clean with no oily residue.,1
Light refreshing mist. Purse size very handy. Cool to the face and moisturizing. Pricey.,1
good.,1
"The product is like a sampler, & such high price. I tried it and you can get the same result with Over the counter $3.00 product. I don't know the comments that they said it is so great and my hair is much thicker. I think they didn't check out the products that are easy available. I spent $33.00 dollars for 2 ounces of each shampoo, conditioner & hair setting lotion and did not see the different. It is a rip off.",0
"Last time I ordered this, it leaked all over the inside of the package.",1
After reading the reviews I really expected it  to clear up my skin more. It didn't. But it is very moisturizing and that is great for my skin.  But for the price I don't think I would get it again.,0
"I've had a number of Hot Tools curling irons so I didn't think this one would be any different.  This one gets too hot!  I can't even touch the little metal stand to lower it with my fingers before usage.... I have to use my comb.  Even though I have it on the lowest temperature setting I burned my hair the first few time using it, requiring me to go to my stylist to cut off the burnt ends.  I use two different heat protectant sprays, including CHI Iron Guard.  I finally have resolved to turning it on shortly before using it, turning it off, then only holding it in my hair for a second or so, then using a Velcro roller so the curl cools and hopefully holds it's shape.  Too much trouble.  May have to return it.  :(",0
Not a good idea to buy make up online unless you have seen the color and tried it in person,0
"I LOVE THE PRODUCT!  I TRIED A SAMPLE OF THE DRY SPRAY, AND IT ALMOST FIXED MY HAIR FOR ME.

Package was damaged when received; can't tell if product was opened.  Strange smell to product upon application.,0
"I've been on a desperate hunt to find a method to help my eye makeup stay where I put it.  I have hooded and oily eyelids. My eyeliner always transfers to my upper eyelid making me look a mess. This primer was recommended for my situation.
It is one of the best primers I've ever used. It helps my eyeliner to stay put. It also of course keeps my eyeshadow fresh all day. As with all primer make sure you don't apply too much. That will have opposite effect and your eye makeup will crease.
I also tried the Wet n Wild celebrity photofocus primer. It is far less expensive and does the job just as well.  I would gladly pay the price of the Pr primer if there wasn't a drugstore alternative. Try them both you won't be disappointed.",1
This hairdryer works well.  I can't say that I was blown away by it (no pun intended) but it is decent.  I was really hoping to love it based on the reviews.  I have lots of fine hair and was hoping this would cut down my drying time significantly which it did but not to the extent I was hoping.  Overall though a good dryer.  It is very lightweight and very quiet.  I appreciate how quiet it is when I need to use it while our 6 month old is napping.,1
All the other perfumes stunk!!!!!,0
"I rarely pinch my eyelashes using the standard drugstore curlers, but it happens.  Also, in cold weather the metal definitely gives the wrong wakeup. This is indeed a pocket curler and it works great.  The curl lasts longer and is very easy to use.",1
great product,1
I've ordered this product before an was very satisfied but this time doesn't seem to work as well. Almost seems like it had been watered down. Very disappointed.,0
I hate this makeup. I put this on my wishlist and I now regret getting it as a gift. UGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!,0
"Didn't see any difference. I was hoping for some sort of change in the texture, puffiness, moisture, but nothing was different.",0
Sorry but maybe a toddler can do their makeup with this. I know it's a travel brush but for peets sake make the brush head itself at least a bit bigger. This brush leaves streaks and I was left very disappointed. I just wound up giving it to my toddler to play with in the end. Waste of money.,0
The problem with puffy eyelids is that they always have the greasy skin feel. I found this product heavy. I would prefer something that made the eyelid feel dry and comfortable.,0
"It take long time to heat up, and long time to strait the hair.",0
Long lasting color. I enjoyed this color in the fall and got so many compliments on it from day one. You only need one coat but two does the trick. I would recommend a top coat as with most nail polishes. I would recommend this color for sure the quality is great.,1
I LOVE IT,1
"I'd order this brand before and it was awesome. This one stained instead of tanned (I realize their own stains but the one that I use before looked like a real tan), and I've got a large container that I'll never touch again.",0
I thought it was going to be like Wen. I use it more like a cream rinse. Probably won't order again.,1
"I was very excited to get this soap in the Plumeria fragrance.

The soap itself works well.  My skin is smooth, not overly dry (which is hard in winter!)
Even with the fine cleaning quality of the soap I can not use it. The fragrance reminds me of the flee shampoo that I use for my cats, and it is very very strong.  It's strong enough that I got a migraine head ache from the product.

If you can tolerate strong scents and want something overwhelmingly floral this is it! If you suffer headaches brought on by scent, I would avoid it.",0
Good heat. Flexible heat and force settings. Has been used  several times.,1
"I really love DDF's Foaming Blemish Cleaner and 10% Glycolic Toner so I decided to try this Protect & Correct SPF lotion but, I don't care for it.  Besides the SPF protection I do not see any benefits of using it.  It hasn't improved my skin tone or texture.  I switched to Estee Lauder Idealist Even Skintone Illuminatior and my skin has never looked better.",0
Not that powerful,0
"My boyfriend's beard is neat, soft and tidy! Great product!",1
Excellent,1
"The tobacco in this is quite nice, but it is overwhelmed by a bright, high pitched bergamot that induced headaches in me every time I burned it. The candle was lovely to look at and I wanted to enjoy it, but in the end I couldn't tolerate it and had to give it away. If you're sensitive to high pitched fragrances, you might want to skip this one.",0
"I've tried and tried to find a non-toxic, extremely moisturizing, firming lotion.  This is the only one I've tried that comes anywhere near actually lasting moisture.  I don't know how much firming it actually does, besides the fact that being more hydrated creates a fuller more plump look to the skin.  This is what I'll keep using, I'll probably always be willing to try another non-toxic firming lotion, but this is what I'll use in the meantime.",1
Results not as expected,0
"Love this product, bought it from my salon previously.  Got this one and it won't spray correctly.  I even took the top off of my old one

"I like La Roche Posay products but after some research I learned that chemical/physical sunscreens are not good for you because every chemical that you put on your skin will go into your bloodstream in other words, don't put anything on your skin that you're not willing to eat, the best way to protect yourself from sun damage is through antioxidants because they act like a sunscreen, if you want to protect yourself even more I recommend Kora Organics",0

If anyone has used Murray's, think of a much much worse version. I tried to use it and I think it pulled part of my scalp off. It also took 2 days to fully wash off of my hands, despite my desperate attempts. Am I supposed to mix it with something to use it? Just terrible.",0

"I loved this blowdryer but shortly after I purchased it the low speed setting seemed to burn out.  Warranty policy is - you pay to ship to back, are without a blowdryer while they assess and either repair or replace.  This should not happen for a $100.00 and will cost you even more in the long run.  I regret this purchase and would not recommend Rusk.",0
I'm biased toward how my skin feels after I use the Benton high skin content toner cuz my skin is so moist afterwards... This one doesn't compare as much but it feels good too. I will use it more once my Benton toner ends and I will share a better review afterwards. It smells good though :),1

worst product,0
"I ordered taupe because lighter shades are rare when it comes to mascara and eyebrow pencils and my hair, brows and lashes are a light brownish grey.  This product is OK, but a bit too dark for my coloring - actually a dark brown that is kind of garish.  It is really easy to apply more than you need, so if you are lighter complected then you might be happier with a blonde shade if you can find it.

The little eyebrow  brush on the lid is a bit difficult to use because the lid is pretty small and awkward when it is off  the pencil, and it swivels around when it is on.  I'd rather just have a stand-alone brush, but this will do in a pinch.

For darker complexions this is fine.  If you are fair or gray, keep looking.",0
"easy to apply, stays on until you wash off with soap. love it!",1
"There are many things I liked about this product. It works quite well as a conditioner.  I love the natural ingredients, i.e. edelweiss, watermelon, brazil nut, etc. It makes it seem exotic but also natural and earthy. From the product description, it claims to convert a portion of UV rays into visible light and helps prevent color fading.  These things are hard for me to judge but it does seem to be an excellent conditioner. I received my bottle free in exchange for an honest review.  As much as I liked Glaze I cant imagine spending $58 for this product.",1
This product needs a way to apply.... could it be in a shaker can?  I do not find it useful.,0
Excellent product . Definitely exfoliates as long as you follow the instructions. I exfoliate and then when I get out of the shower I put on a body butter all over my body. My skin feels like baby skin.,1
not a strong smell of gardenia. won't order this scent again,0
"This lotion works very well.  I'm very fair, but this lotion gives me a natural-looking tan without any streaks or that all-to-familiar fake tanner smell. The tan builds over several applications, so  it's hard to misapply it. I started with the light to medium color, but eventually switched to the medium-dark in hopes of getting longer-lasting color. Even with the darker color, I find that I need to apply it most nights to maintain the color.  It also takes a while to dry, and goes quickly (one bottle lasts me about three weeks).  I highly recommend this if you find it hard to get an even application from fake tanners and don't mind the hassle of applying nightly and waiting for it to dry, but if you'd like a more economical option that will last a few days in between applications, this probably isn't for you.",1
"dail goes up to 300...go figure...doesnt heat to 450 like the product summary.  i did not like it, no heat",0
"I am very happy with this eye rejuvenator.  I clicked on it only needs to be applied once each day because there was not a box for twice a day--morning and evening after cleansing face.  The color of the cream is white and blends into the skin so it doesn't matter what the skin tone is.  The bottle appears small, but this is the third bottle of this product that I have used, and the previous bottles have lasted at least three months each time.  It only takes a very small amount for each use.  My advice is not to depress the top of the bottle all the way so you won't get too much out at one time.",1
"pretty color but it chips so quickly & easily... and they won't let me return it, even with Amazon Prime?",0
"This just didn't work for me. I have other highlighters that I like better. Wanted to love this, but it was a miss for me, especially for the price.",0
note impressed. the fragrance doesn't hold and it made my hair greasy on day 2.,0
"I wanted to like this cologne, but it's way too intense for me. No pun intended. It is not one of those scents where you can just apply it very sparingly and be fine. It is a knock you out from across the room strength intensity. Not good. The scent itself is not bad, it could be pleasant if it were only 1/4 as strong. Thank goodness I sprayed a testing spritz into the box it came in, rather than on myself. This is literally unwearable in my opinion. I know colognes are a very personal preferrence so I'll list several that I use which might be of help to you in determining whether this scent is for you. Regardless, please go try it in a store before making a ""blind"" purchase. Colognes I enjoy are: Euphoria and Encounter by Calvin Klein, Blue by Marc Ecko, Gio by Georgio Armani, All American Stetson, and Voyage by Nautica.",0
"This is an easy to apply powder foundation. Coverage is buildable and it looks natural. It has a light comfortable feel but does not last long unless you use finishing spray. I found that it did tend to blur imperfections more than actually cover them. still and improvement. The color was a tad too warm for me and had a slightly orangey tone that didn't work with my skin. Packaged in a serviceable black compact, it does not include an applicator of any sort.",1
Who would think that a $50 candle could smell this bad?  I've had candles at one third the price that are far superior.  I can only hope I can get my money back.  Don't buy this candle.,0
So far I am enjoying this product. It has been approx 2 months and I'm seeing some spots w less hair. It is not painful and easy to use. Will keep using this product. Way better than no! No! Way way way better.,1
"The taste is lovely and unusual and this paste performs fine, but I was shocked to notice that the first ingredient listed is aluminum hydroxide! Obviously this product isn't meant to be ingested, but doesn't aluminum pose a sufficient health risk to be avoided for oral use? I tossed my Marvis out and bought some BlanX Natural elsewhere.",0
"I love a good face mask. While I do like this mask, it just smells way to strong. In fact it is so strong that it makes my eyes water so I can only use it on my chin area. It feels good on and my skin feels soft and tight once I was it off, but I just don't find myself wanting to use it because of the scent.",0
perfect - quick shipping!,1
"Love the way it leaves my hair, and smells great.",1
"Great product that can be used as base coat, plain color, & top coat",1
Bueno,1
"I love this eyelash curler! Other eyelash curlers pinch my skin sometimes and so I'd avoid using it but this gives me a lot more control on which part of my eyelashes I'm curling. On top of that, it is way more portable for traveling!",1
Delivered without a cap on it.  How am I supposed to transport it when I travel?!  It wasn't just not on the can..... it totally was not in the taped box!,0
"This is an easy to use razor that delivers a great shave.  I was using a Merkur 34 which I liked a lot, and would still be using, but I dropped it on a marble floor.  It chipped a corner which exposed a corner of the blade and so if I wasn't careful I would get a nasty nick.

I have a fairly heavy beard and wanted something a little more aggressive than the 34, but still one that was easy to use.  The slant bar works nicely.  I followed the advice from other reviews and just used it like a normal razor.  I ignore the slant bar while shaving.  It works great.  I get a better shave than with the 34 with no irritation.  My only quibble is with the checkering on the handle.  It could and should be cut a little deeper.  The handle in my opinion is a little too smooth.  Still this is a small complaint.  I really like this razor a lot and am glad to have made the switch.",1
Very good product,1
Broken  worst product,0
Have been using this for years and for people with dry sensitive skin this is the answer. Sunscreen is a plus for us Florida gals too.,1
"This is a small amount of lotion, which is perfect for someone who hasn't tried the brand before. It smells amazing, moisturizes beautifully, and doesn't leave my hands sticky or greasy feeling.",1
These colors are for older women & also peels quite easily for a high-end nail polish.,0
Perfect I love it,1
"I love CK one, but the deodorant is horrible, Sicky, wet & can barely smell the CK One, was really bummed",0
smell can bother some,1
I have used this product in the past but the tube I received on this order was empty or defective.  Not sure which but other than a very tiny drop I could not get any additional product out of the tube.  I am pretty sure the tube I received was empty as the pump appears to be working.  Have returned for either a refund or replacement.,0
I thought this product was awesome until it started changing color coming out of the tube. It was white and now there's streaks of brown in it. Might be the supplier or the product might be defective.,0
"This stuff is fantastic for use during hot summers in Las Vegas. No smudging, no smearing.",1
It's really heavy for my skin and can cause breakouts,0
it did not work for me at all...it was just waste of money. I have dark spots on my face left over from pregnancy. This product did not help at all to lighten them,0
For 20 dollars I was expecting more. Most of the  samples where little packets. I was expecting  small trial size containers. Plus one of the items had a crack and completely spilled out so I cant even use that. Not worth 20 bucks. I only gave it 2 Stars cause some of the products smelled good/worked ok.,0
Works well and is organic but is not actually good for my health.,0
The product is not authentic. The ingredients are different than authentic bottle which I got at local salon,0
Long time user; excellent product. Quick absorbing.,1
I used the polish with the Cnd vinylux top coat and my polish was perfect for nearly two weeks! This is the only polish I'll be using from now on!,1
did not work,0
"While this lip balm does indeed contain ingredients that help to improve dry lips and prevent moisture loss, it is also highly fragranced, containing many fragrant volatile chemicals, chemicals known to cause irritation, particularly if you have a sensitive skin. In reality this could mean potentially drier, more chapped lips.",0
I have used this product before and it seems to work but my comment here is about the change of packaging from the zip lock bags to the cardboard tube. Please bring back the zip lock bags!  I can't tell you how many times I picked up the new container and the top just slides off and they spill on the floor. Poor design though it looks nice. I also prefer the bags because they are easy to travel with too bc they can just slip in your purse.  Please bring back the old packaging!,1
"Love this product!  Gives my straight, boring hair that ""just came out of the ocean and let my hair dry without brushing it"" look.  I always get compliments when using this product.",1
"I was expecting better quality, but it's ok.",1
This hair dryer has a low setting that is not low - it is higher than the high on my prior hair dryer.  It is so forceful that it is difficult to style my hair.  The heat and forceful air make it very hard on my fine hair.  I am totally dissatisfied with this hairdryer.,0
"When I ordered this mask, I didn't realize it was a men's facial mask. I tried it anyway and I liked it. For reference, I have combination skin, that has larger pores in the T-zone and I get dry skin outside the T-zone. This mask worked great. For my skin type I need to do a cleansing/drawing mask at least once or twice a month.

This really made the pores on the sides of my nose look smaller. It just made my face feel cleaner too. I also liked the sea-type of scent, it was a masculine scent, just a fresh, sea-mineral, type of scent. I left it on longer than it called for, but, it didn't seem to strip my skin of all moisture.

Overall, I'd definitely repurchase this and use again, though, I did knock a star off because of price (I'm cheap!). It didn't break me out and it did great for reducing the look of pores on my nose.",1
Really great cleanser that doesn't dry out your skin.  I use it as a break from acne systems cleansers when I need something a bit gentler on my skin.,1
Does not foam up no matter how hard you rub your hands together,0
More clear than expected,0
Wonderful eye cream... Wouldn't use anything else and this was a fantastic price!!,1
I've been using this waxing kit for 10 years or more.  I was so happy when the microwavable version came out.  But see the photograph that shows the wax coming half way up the container?  That's false advertising because you know get half that much and the price just went up 33% (used to be $36 then jumped to $48 - ridiculous for such a small amount of wax).  I used to be able to do multiple waxings with one kit but it's nearly impossible to do one job with the small amount that Bliss now gives its customers.  I'll be looking for new wax to use.,0
"Ive used Baxter of California Slick Pomade it the past and thought I would try this Hard Cream Pomade. The Hard Cream Pomade is a much different consistency than the California style. This one is a thick paste not as hard as the Slick Pomade. It .

Baxter of California Hard Cream Pomade goes into my hair easily and doesn't leave a sticky feeling residue in my hair like some gels I've used in the past. My only problem with this pomade is the cost it's $5 more than American Crew and you only get 2 oz verse the 3 oz in the Fiber container.",1
Very good,1
"Pros: It is dual voltage (120 volts 60 hertz or 240 volts 50 hertz) allowing you to use it in the US and abroad. There is a screw for you to change the voltage. It's almost as powerful and heats up like a regular dryer, which is a huge plus for me.  I've got a ton of hair and those wimpy hotel Sunbeam wall mount dryers just don't cut it.

Cons: It's expensive. I would not invest in this as your every day dryer as you can get a better full-size dryer for the price but if you travel a lot, as I do, the voltage option is key. It's a lot heavier and bulkier than the typical travel hair dryer so I would not recommend this if you're looking for something small. There is a hinge at the handle that allows it to fold but it's still far from compact.

I've been taking this dryer with me to Europe and it works great. I've been using it intermittently for a year and it's still going strong. Essentially, it's a full-size dryer but with a voltage option.  However, I don't use this in lieu of my full size dryer because I love my light weight FHI Nano.",1
"I love the scent, but the scent fades quickly.",0
Really good quality,1
This color is similar to a bubble gum sparkle pink.  It looked like it would be a creamy beige to me or at least I hoped it would be.  Looking for a nice neutral shade.  It was anything but.  This one will be tossed.,0
"For an expensive Chi product I expected better. I'm accustomed to the cheap drug store hair protectants and decided to try a more expensive, reputable brand. I figured Chi would make a great product, but I didn't like the spray at all. It left my hair feeling crunchy and gross. My hair felt completely fried after using it and didn't feel protected from a flat iron whatsoever. The product was really thick and sticky, so that's how it felt in my hair and all over my hands. Will be returning.",0
I think it's a great dryer. Not sure it's worth the price (yet) but I like it. Not disappointed. Hope it lasts many years. I blow dry only 2-3 times a month. It's pretty light and easy to handle. My hairdresser suggested it.,1
"This is the best thickener I've used. It really does make my hair feel much thicker without adding extra weight or gunk. We ride motorcycles and when I get helmet hair, I can dampen it and re-fluff with my fingers and it looks great.",1
Pricey but works...just wish it were more cost friendly.  Won't be purchasing again.,1
This is really good for making your hair shine without making your hair heavy.  It is hard to find but really good,1
"I have combination/oily skin in my T-ZONE and was recommended the Mario Badescu Oil Free moisturizer. I use 2x a day after washing my face/using toner. I use during the summer under my matte mineral powder, and it provides excellent coverage with the additional SPF. The lotion kind gives you a glowing look- but sometimes it can contribute to the oiliness. A little bit goes a long way. I'm not sure if I would wear this long-term sure there are better moisturizers out there that don't contribute to the oiliness. If my skin was dry I would surely recommend!",1
The pump itself was broken upon arrival...,0
"I got all three ""Manizer Sisters."" I'm a ""makeup enthusiast"" but not a makeup artist. The breakdown:

Mary Lou is a gold champagne. Very reflective and the most reflective of the group. Highly Pigmented, blends well. Very beautiful. From seeing it online, I think it would look best on very fair-medium-tan skin tones and might start to look ashy on darker skin tones. You can control the intensity by blending out less product on the cheeks (makes it sheerer) or using it wet (intense).

Cindy Lou is a slightly dusty pinky peach. Less reflective and more of a satin sheen finish, the least reflective of the group. Blends well, very pretty, but also less pigmented than the rest, but still usable. More subtle. For light-medium skin tones in my opinion, but you may want to look up swatches on others yourself.

Betty Lou is a warm bronze with golden undertones. Very pigmented and blends well. The second most reflective in the group, but when I blended it out as a bronzer on my light skintone, it didn't look muddy and was very beautiful if you like warm bronzers. It also didn't look like a highlighter as much when blended out well, which means it can work as both. This would be a great bronzer for light-tan skin tones, depending on how deep you are and how well you blend it out if you're lighter. It would also be a great highlighter for tan-deep skin tones.

I have pictures of swatches with and without flash, and blended on my face over a light layer of foundation. On my face, Mary Lou is nearest my ear, Cindy Lou is in the middle, and Betty Lou is nearest my cheek. The colors don't show up the best, but the swatches should help clear things up.",1
"I purchased this product for a trip to scotland.  I paid $20 for it and it worked very well for that price.  Dont compare it to your expensive flat iron at home and you will be pleased.  I have short, chin-length hair, and could get my hair done in 10 ish minutes--managable but not perfect hair in that time.  It is dual volatage so you can use it abroad or in the states, i used my converter adaptor set w/ it anyway.  It heats up very quickly and is the perfect travel size---can fit in your carryon and not take up much space.  There are no heat adjustment settings--hot is what you get, so you may want to make sure you use a protective spray on your hair first.
Overall, very pleased w/ the product and the price.",1
"Amazing product! Gentle on particularly sensitive skin (acne treatment with chemicals in my case). It removes everything, including eye makeup. Leaves no residue on the skin even if not rinsed.",1
"I have long, thick, somewhat coarse hair that tends to get frizzy and dry on the ends. I've tried many products over the years, and this has been the best. Upon using it, my hair dried much more quickly and was super smooth and shiny. I usually have to use my flat iron to smooth my hair after blow drying (I just can't get it smooth enough with just the hair dryer). With this spray, I don't need to use the flat iron (which is great because less heat on my hair is definitely a plus). One thing that I'm not crazy about - the smell. It smells very strong and perfumey when you first put it on. It smells somewhat like incense which I don't like. But, after blowdrying I could barely smell it anymore and by the next day I couldn't smell it at all. I am so happy to find this product!",1
"I do wish there was a way to tell when there is sparkle in a product. This does have a little sparkle in it, but is a pretty color.",1
"Can't decide if this product makes my hair look the same or worse, leaning towards worse. Also, for the ridiculous price, I got a very small bottle that I used 4-5 times and then it was empty. Which was not totally a bad thing because I was really disappointed with this product and would never buy again.",0

"This is THE BEST and only top coat that actually lives up to its promise. It will stay on for a week with no chipping even on bright colors, like red and black, with no re-application. I did not think that was possible, but this stuff really works. It is fast drying and the shine stays on the whole time. I will never buy any other top coat, but this one.",1
"It took some getting use to this product because it had a wider flattening surface than i had used before, but now that i've used it a few times and adjusted the heat, i love it.

I answered this.review too quickly because I am not using this product any more. The outer covering is peeling and falls in my hair.",0
"I use mineral liquid make up. This LaRoche Posay  foundation offers the same benefits. It goes on smoothly. I used a make up brush and it covered just as well as my mineral makeup. It has a beautiful finish. It is not quite a dewy look but not a matte either. It is somewhere in between. It has a velvety finish.

My biggest concerns are dark spots, so I need something that provides an even finish. This does so. It is not too heavy either. The color blended well into my medium-light complexion. A little goes a long way. The one drawback is that this does not last as long throughout the day. I needed to reapply about 6 hours later. It just needed a touch up. Otherwise I really like this foundation.",1
This curling iron is great!  It's easy to use and feels good in my hand.  I like that buttons aren't in the way.  Love it!,1

"Still have dry scalp after trying this for 3 weeks, used as directed. Will keep looking for something that works for me.

Update, I'm using T-Gel now and for me it works. I was so bad I had scabs from picking at my dead skin.",0
"I felt bouji buying this at the price, but I really love it.  If you enjoy licorice then you will enjoy using this every day.  I plan to re-buy it when I run out.",1
"I just used what was left of my friends Magnified Volume Finishing Spray because I was out of my regular sculpting spray.  It has a good hold yet it leaves my hair flexible, with volume and even though it has Alcohol 40 in it, it does not make my hair sticky, stiff or dry, surprisingly and that maybe because of other good ingredients such as; Sage, Rosemary, Algae, Lavender, Nettle, Chamomile, and Thyme extracts.  After I spray it on, it stays and gives my fine to medium hair more volume and even when the wind blows, it stays in place pretty good.  I am in the process of getting another can which means I am switching to this.  All in all, this is a pretty good hair spray with a grape scent.",1
"I read a review after I'd been using it for a couple of weeks stating that her face broke out horribly. Well, my skin took a couple of weeks and then all the places I applied it broke out horribly as well. Ah! Not worth it considering I used it for over a month and it did nothing for my skin. It didn't even hydrate!",0
"Good razor I ordered the long handle one, but got the short with the guard still does the job so can't complain too much.",1
"I use this, but am not sure it is doing anything more differently than what I was using before.  It is a nice moisturizer and easy to use.",1
This my favorite moisturizer but it is pricey for no good reason other than excessive profit-making.,1
Please don't buy these products. So I read all the reviews and bought it anyway. For the first month- everything was fine. No real difference but nothing bad happened. I woke up this morning and put on the EYE CREAM and a few minutes later my eye was swollen! Loreal products are cheaper and work amazing. I've been using them for 20 years and not one issue... Don't spend the money. This is the only bad review I've ever written. Seriously it's so disappointing:(,0
"This is a good tool, but it makes my (curly) hair almost too straight.  It is a little flat on the top when I use this.  My hair is so straight and silky that it's almost limp and I usually need to curl it (especially on top!)  But all in all I'm liking its ability to straighten.  It did not take long to figure out how to use this.  Maybe I should have purchased a 1.5 inch rotating brush instead?  If you want straight hair, buy this.  OBTW, I have not experienced any hair damage as some other people have said.  My hair is below shoulder length.",1
She loves it. I have no hair.,1
"Fabulous skin line.  I received my  first products from my sisters, they would bring them back from France.  They were only available in France and Canada.  Then my Dermatologist started stocking La Roche Posay. .  I have been using these products for the last 12 years. Just as good as La Mer and Lazlo.",1
I have used this every night for a week with no results. It's an expensive product to buy to not get your money worth. Sounds like it works for some people though so maybe it's just my skin type.,0
There was no seal and this is not the same product as what I have from dermstore online. Do not buy.,0
This lotion feels almost chalky as I smooth it into my skin.  It is not emollient at all!,0
scent last not longer then 1 hr,0
I love this thing and use it every day.  The one drawback to it is that it gets super hot to the touch on the outside.  When I'm done drying my hair it's pretty hot.  I feel like I can't put it away until it cools.  But other than that it's a great attachment.,1
Great quality but looked terrible on my nails,1
Product arrived in a bad condition with the box all beaten up as well as the lotion (see picture). Not sure if this was supposed to have a security seal but mines didnt. The product isn't thick and consistency doesnt seem the same for mine as with other purchasers. The lotion is thin and watery-like. Very overrated for the price,0
NOT as good as the original,0
"a rip off, no better than mass produced drugstore item, very little cream in tube",0

"The first eyeliner I bought a year ago, worked fantastic! Long lasting and no smudging. I had to scrub my eyelids with makeup remover in order to remove it. I took it on a cruise and went swimming all day with it on with no problems. Unfortunately,  the time came that I had to replace the eyeliner.

This new one I received is absolutely terrible! Did they change the formula?? It smudges within minutes and can easily be removed with the back of my hand. I'm really disappointed, because it was so hard to find a good eyeliner and now this pricey one seems to be just as bad as the cheap drugstore brands.",0
Great product and great seller,1
didnt work on me at all....disappointed,0
"A great product, recommended by my stylist. Like many other posters, I live in the Southeast, so humidity is an everyday occurence. With Root Pump Plus, my style stands a lot more than a fighting chance against the weather! Gives me so much volume; normally my hair is straight and very limp. I really like that I don't have to use much of the stuff to achieve my desired results, too. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because when it dries and you run your fingers or a brush through your hair, it feels like there is a bit of build up on the scalp. Nothing major, though, and nothing shampooing with baking soda won't fix. Love it!",1
"I am going to use this as my travel cream.  It goes on nicely, I like the slight oatmeal aroma, and it gives me a nice, close shave.",1

"The anti-acne ingredient in Vichy Normaderm Beautifying lotion is 1.5% salicylic acid. I generally use a product with 2% concentration, so I didn't expect this lotion to be so drying. My skin began flaking and peeling after one use - and that's not all that unusual with a new anti-acne lotion, but even spacing out applications, after more than a week it's not any better. I'm going back to my higher concentration, but somehow gentler, regular product.",0
"Ive had this stuff before and I got about 8+ girlfriends to use this as well. My hair becomes as soft as feathers, and makes my hair smell great!! I ordered the largest  bottle so I have it for more hair styles lol",1
One coat of this polish covers the nail wonderfully.  I did have some chipping after a couple days but my profession requires tons of hand washing and also glove wearing so I wasn't surprised or disappointed.  The only way I can polish to last for a week is with a shellac type manicure.  Wonderful color and went on nicely.  I paired with Butter base and top coat.,1
Love the fragrance. I really like Calvin Klein for myself and the line of men's products for my husband are good too.,1
This lotion is very gentle and goes on smooth.  It is medium weight so keeps my skin moisturized through the night but it isn't too greasy.  Perfect before bed.,1
"Bought Samoan Sand, Dulce De Leche & Tickle My Francey.  Horrible colors.

Adding pictures...color on hand is Samoan Sand.",0

Amazing product,1
"Any Toppik side effects?

Yes.

Research from forum comments state that Toppik hair building fiber ingredients contain ammonium chloride, and that this substance has caused side effects in some people.

Like many chemicals, ammonium chloride can be hazardous if a significant amount were to enter your body. So, potentially, repeated exposure over time might lead to ammonia poisoning, with the following possible symptoms:

Muscle spasm.
Irregular breathing.
Irregular or slow heartbeat.
Contact can irritate skin and damage eyes.
Inhalation can irritate the nose, throat and lungs.
There can be an allergic response much like asthma.
Coma!

As you can see, ammonium chloride is not something you really want to keep putting into, or onto, your body in large amounts. Your risk probably depends upon:

How often you use the product.
How much you apply each time.
Individual sensitivity or allergy.
Whether your diet includes any other source of ammonium chloride (e.g., some spirits, fizzy drinks, confectionery, meat, etc.) which can cause the dose you get to accumulate.

Forum posts have also reported: aching muscles, heart palpitations and persistent headaches. And for what it's worth, some users also said they find the smell a bit strong!",0
I have been using this for years on permed hair. It brings the curl up and seems to make it last longer.,1
I love that when you apply this product it doesn't tan you immediately. It gives you that summer glow gradually which makes it look more natural. I like that I don't look orange. The only down side is that it smells of self tan. Not the greatest smell. I just put on loads of perfume and then its not too bad. There are no streaks which is great!,1

"I don't do reviews very often, but this product is very good and thought I should share. I've had mild acne for 25 years, nothing horrible, but have a zit or two on my face more often than zit-free face, and occasionally they are bad. Finally went to a dermatologist, who recommended this product. WOW!!!! Really is fantastic at cleaning without overly drying out skin. Seems like it almost ""lifts"" blackheads out of the skin, though I'm sure that tecnhically it does not do that. At any rate, couldn't be happier with the product, and along with zit cream, has vanquished my mild acne.",1
"This product is very watery. A moisturizer should not be so runny.  For the price, I was expecting a bit stronger product. Save your money on this one.",0
"This is very good hand cream. Living in a cooler climate and washing my hands fairly often dries them out badly, and so far (a few weeks of use) this has made a huge difference. It brags of its natural ingredients too, so that can't hurt. So far, excellent results.",1
"Minty and tingly!
It's a nice shampoo but you need to use the conditioner too or it feels weird. Like eating cereal after brushing your teeth, this stuff is potent!",1
"This product sucks, it's oily and muddy. Wouldn't recommend it. What a waste of money.",0
I bought this product because i burned my face and friends suggested for me to buy it so I can little by litttle improve my burn.  At first it worked but then the equipment stopped suctioning as it was when I first got it.  It was maybe 4 month after purchase contacted customer services I they told me that I needed to purchase a new tip I informed the lady that I had not use all the tips and i tried with a new one and still it did not work as when I got it.  I do not recomended to expensive for only maaybe 10 to 15 uses.,0
"This is a horrible product. I used it before curling my hair and all of my curls were super crunchy, like I used extra hold hair spray! Will never purchase again.",0
Works as advertised!,1
"I like it but I don't LOVE it. I have been on the hunt for the perfect eyeliner. While this one is nice to put on, it does get a little sticky / shiny and wears off if I sweat at all. I was pleased enough with it until I got Tarte eyeliner, aka when the heavens opened and showed me the light. I'll never go back to anything else.

I honestly don't know why this is touted as being a ""cult favorite.""",1
This made my skin take a ghostly look even after I moisturized my skin. I'm african american but my skin burns quite easier so I have to use sunblock all year round and was looking for a more natural sunblock to use. I came across this on a list that listed this product I wouldn't recommend to this product to anyone.,0
"After reading a lot of reviews, this seemed like a great product. It has a lot of power and gets pretty hot. Feels like salon quality. I noticed a huge difference after using this compared to a lesser quality dryer (hair is less coarse and frizzy. notice smoother and shinier. I would recommend this product.",1
Looks ok on your head.,1
2 coats and a topcoat and still it chipped.  Thought at this price it would be better quality polish but no!,0
I wouldn't waste your money.,0
"After months of using it twice a day, there have been no changes.",0
"I was in Glasgow Scotland when I smelled this perfume at John Lewis department store. I wish I had bought it then so as soon as I was back in the US, i went to Amazon for my purchase. Love this perfume!",1
"Super disappointed with this iron. The clamp is so tight that it leaves indentions in your hair and you're unable to get a smooth curl. Also, it can't seem to curl the top of your hair - just the bottom (I have short hair so it shouldn't have a problem curling from top to bottom). I've had better luck with cheaper brands from the drugstore. Also beware when purchasing as they do not allow returns on this. Which is extra disappointing bc I bought it would be eligible for returns since it was a prime item.",0
"Love this dry shampoo.  I have tried many others and none made me as happy as this.  It smells great, but doesn't make your hair look really powdery. I do have lighter colored hair, so I'm not sure how darker haired individuals might fair with the powder issue.  I will be buying again.",1
Save your money,0
Took to salon for gel application. All ten nails peeled off within  twenty four hours. Tried at home using my gel system with the same result. Tried without gel system. It was like soup. Trashed it...,0
I recently was recommended this product after a spa facial.  I bought it at the spa (for quite a bit more than here on Amazon) and was immediately impressed by the results.  This is a wonderful product.  Make sure that you tap it several times before applying it to your face and neck and also it is designed to work without light so don't put it on until you are ready for the darkness of bed.,1
I didn't care for this. I don't like the texture and it's sticky to me. I won't buy this again.,0
"Biolage seems to have changed the formulation a bit but it's still great, and I can't get this at my local stores anymore.  Delivery was prompt with no problems.",1
"This is a great mineral powder that provides light coverage.  The downside, it is pricey and I feel as though I waste half of the foundation when I ""tap"" my powder brush as you are supposed to do when applying.  Also, you do need to ensure you have the proper technique for application or it can ""cake"" in areas.  Overall, I am happy with this purchase and plan to continue to use.  I have light skin, blue yes, medium brown hair, and wear the light beige.",1
"This eyeshadow is the worst I've ever used! Very low pigment so I have to pile it on to be able to see it. Drug store shadow is better than this crap! Alao, amazon won't let me return it because it's been opened. I will never buy makeup from amazon again. Don't waste your money on this product.",0
Too thin and doesn't last. Smells like polish remover. ,0
Love this product,1
"Does what it says. Really great idea, but upon using it, it appears to have many of the same  characteristics of white glue...which would probably do the same thing. Probably wouldn't buy again.",1
Great Product would order again,1
"This tiny bottle packs a punch! Usually, it takes lots of scrubbing back and forth with the other nail polish removers to get one nail clean... with this, you can clean your entire 10 fingers with ONE cotton ball and just minutes. No more scrubbing and scrubbing, this formula really cleans easily. Of course, it's a small little bottle so it's you'll want it to last. Get this and you'll never go back to generic brands!",1
Terrible reaction! Chemical burn with irritation redness swelling and peeling under my eyes! It's been 2 weeks and didn't heal yet. It has been second time arond try. Terrible terrible wrinkles. NEVER have had any allergy on anything. I beg you to not even try this product. I don't know how to heal my skin after this cream. Embarrassed to go outside.,0
Great!!!,1
Was not the shade I thought it would be.  When applied it streaked.  I won't try this again.  Product was delivered as promised.,0
Nice color for two days. And very thick and moisturizing to put on!! Then fades patchy. Also it never dries completely and you feel sticky ALL day. So bad with feeling sticky!!,0
Cleanses well. But like any other cleansers. Didn't seem anything special.,1
"I see a difference in the product, other than if I went to Ulta to purchase it. Case is different and so is the product. Darker than the label says. Not the same product by any means..",0
"I was really worried about trying this because I usually stick to products that are tried and true SAFE for sensitive skin.  But, I've heard really nice things about this company so I thought I would give it a try on my eczema prone skin.  I washed my face as usual, applied this at night and waited for any irritation.  At first, I felt a little itching, but that isn't unusual for me when I put product on my face because it's so hypersensitive.  I had to wait to see if it got worse.  It didn't.  It surprisingly calmed my skin down within minutes.

It's thick, rich but not greasy.  My skin soaked it up.  I have extra dry skin and this was very nourishing.

I'm looking forward to trying this daily.  I do love the product, its rare for me to actually find something that isn't loaded with perfume scent or irritates my sensitive skin. I just wish the cost wasn't so pricey.  I would most likely want to give this another try, but I'll update with continued use to see if anything changes.  So far, I would highly recommend.",1
"The scents are nothing too spectacular. Except for ""Not a perfume,"" all the scents have some sort of fruitiness to them. I purchased my kit from parfum1, it was the real deal.",1
waste of money.  It's not bad.  It's just NOT worth the money.,0
"I originally bought Argan Spray at Publix grocery store but was disappointed that they no longer carried it when I ran out so I bought it through Amazon. I have fine, long wavy hair and I've been experimenting with different products to tame the frizz. I've found that putting mousse in wet, washed hair and then letting that air dry and spritzing with Argan Spray gives me exactly the look I want.",1
"Pump broke after a couple uses....great soap, bad pump",0
The product didn't work well for me! I did not like it. Sorry!,0
Really like this Mousse. I have thin and fine hair and this helps with volume without making hair sticky or stiff!,1
"Works grate. Love it, you can use in dry hair, not sticky, not shining, good smell, reasonable price.

I Really recomende it.",1
I love the way my hair feels and smells after using Oribe.,1
"Another one of my least favorite preshaves. Entirely too sticky for me... It leaves a nasty ring of shaved hair around the sink after the water drains, even when using a little bit. I prefer something between the runny splashes out there... and this glue product.",0
"This dryer was nothing special when it worked but now is totally worthless - worked fine one day, won't turn on the next. I tried using the reset button but still nothing. So now it's in the trash and I'll buy a new one. Save your receipt if you buy this dryer!",0
"This palette is AMAZING! I wear every color so nothing is wasted. They all look beautiful. I love all the variations of the nude, brown, taupe.
I wear 3-4 colors daily and can even put some of the colors to match with my eyebrows. I love it, love it!
I don't have anything negative to say about this palette. Just to note, I have fair skin and brown eyes.",1
Love it. Finishing second bottle,1
I am blond and blue-eyed with light skin and this color is great for me.  Lasts all day (I set it with a light coat of translucent loose powder).  No makeup base.  Just this color on the cheeks..,1
"Did not like this product at all!  Would have checked no stars, if possible.  I have thinning hair so I tried the conditioner but it does the opposite on me.  Made my hair flat and unmanageable.",0
Like the products,1
super product,1
"It seems the ""color"" was a lighter shade than before.  I don't know if it was a different formula or just labeled wrong but it defiantly was a lighter shade than before",0
"Decent conditioner. Hair type: thick, naturally curly, long, dry.
This conditioner smells amazing and seems to be quite gentle, I do have to use a lot of it but that is normal for my hair type. I would re-purchase this product again. :)",1
"Love the combination of heat and blower settings, so you can have the highest blower speed with the medium heat setting.  Don't have to burn your hair in order to dry it quickly.",1
Not the best.,0
Did not like the way the product worked in my hair.,0
perfect product,1
This nail polish is just perfect.  It's not too pinky or orangy.  Just perfect bright red.  Looks great. Is not transparent like some of the nail polishes are.,1
"I guess I should have looked more closely at the size, I assumed since it was twice the price of the supersmile toothpaste I buy that each tube would be that size. These are less than 1/3 of he size so it is a big ripoff. I bought it for the Remineralization but nowhere does the box or tube even mention the word. The tube of whitening accelerator has a label stuck over the ingredients label which is very strange and means the package was opened. I don't see any ingredients listed that makes m believe the accelerator does anything more than the toothpaste does which honestly is not anything special.
I am very disappointed and feel ripped off.",0
"Defective bottle, the spray knob doesn't work properly. Not worth calling Amazon for this defect.",0
this shampoo isn't anything special. it's the same as my regular cheap shampoo that i normally use. the price is way too high.,0
"Defective right out of the box. Turns on (lights up), but doesn't heat up. Also, weird small rust-like spots on shaft, 5 total. Some could be scratched off, some couldn't. Returning and disappointed.",0
Wears off and chips easily - lasts about 2 days.,0
"Too much hand presser to get iron to close on hair. GET READY to have Carpal tunnel syndrome soon with this one! I hate it.. also it went out on me basically the digital sensor has malfunctioned and goes on an off to sleep and back on while in my hand while doing a client! I am returning it ( I brought it directly from FHI) going to see of they will replace it with the Nano Titanium Professional Hair Straightener (1"") I don't care if it is a more less expensive iron an I don't get any difference back I cannot afford for this to happen to me again. It is not the quality I am use to from FHI. I had the first limited addition EPS Titanium Professional Hair Straightener (1"") used it for years before it went out on me... an it would still work if I could have the cord replaced for that reason alone I won't throw it out... Im keeping hope alive i can fix it I LOVED that iron! This one not so much.",0
Only 4 stars as the powder was a bit heavy. I prefer the liquid make up in this line.,1
Smells lovely. Not a lot of coverage but just enough for a natural look.,1
Stopped working after 2 uses. Won't even turn on now.,0
I love this iron ..the comb it comes with really helps my hair come out straight... Not many irons come with this comb ...the iron does stop heating after a year and a half of everyday use.,1
"There are better more natural looking products out there, especially for more textured hair types.",0
"Excellent product,I love to wear it and how i look now make me feel great.  I recommend this product to those who have hair lost problems.",1
satisfactory delivery,0
"Not worth the $20.  Too many products for men.  No real ""luxury"" products.",0
I wasn't crazy about any of these sample size products and most of them smelt terrible.,1
"Butter LONDON makes nail polish in incredible colors so i'm always tempted to buy them. However, the polish itself is incredibly watery, needs several coats to look decent, chips like whoa, and (given all of that) is pretty expensive.

But, I really wanted to like Butter! So, I bought the Butter base coat and top coat to see if that would somehow affect the quality of the polish---nope, just more money wasted. The only time I've been happy with this nail polish is when I bring it into my nail salon and have a professional apply it.

Pros
-Gorgeous Colors

Cons
-Chips all the time
-Thin, watery polish consistency that needs multiple coats
-Expensive for the quality
-Using their base coat and top coat did not help the end result",0
"Kitridge is a great shade of bubblegum pink. Great for summer. I would give the color 5 stars, but I have to give 4 before of the formula. I have to use 3 coats because application is a little streaky. Then I notice the polish starts to crack on my nails after a couple days. The isn't a huge issue for me because I repaint my nails every couple days, but if you want a color that lasts a long time, this isn't it.",1
Doctor told me to add growth factor to skin care routine.  LOVE this product.,1
Truly the best sunscreen on the market!!!  YOU WILL NEVER BURN AGAIN!!!!!! It's the only sunblock I will buy for my family:),1
"Goes on beautifully and stays on all day! Truly waterproof, even on you inner waterline.",1
"Works really well! It's harder to straighten the roots with it, but overall it leaves hair feeling really smooth!",1
Don't buy this product. Olay Regenerist and ROC do a better job.,0
"I have written 2 E-mails on this matter. I still have not received this item. I have sent 2 email with no response yet.  Can you please rectify this situation as soon as possible.  I will not recommend this company to anyone due to the fact that
I have not received my purchase yet and due to the fact that I can not get anyone to respond to me!",0
Really works!,1
"At first I thought the product was great, it did smooth and shine. But after a couple of days I noticed my hair was getting more and more build up and looked greasy and dull. After shampooing it for a week now, two times a shower the stuff is still there. HORRIBLE! Never again. I am going to go buy a clarifying shampoo to see if that gets it out.",0
"I bought this micro crimper in December of 2013. It was great for building body but sadly, less than 15 months later, it no longer works.",0
"This lip balm offers lots of moisture and the perfect amount of shimmer and shine! Love this, my favorite to wear out!",1
I like the product but one of the cans stopped working about 1/3 of the way,0
my tooth color is still the same as it was before I started using the product.  I used it for about month and a half.,0
"This stuff is great, with one cotton pad I can take off ALL of my waterproof mascara. However I had to give 4 stars instead of 5 because the bottle top came partially broken. Thankfully none of the product spilled out.",1
Works well but smells bad,0
Great smell and it works for a long time.  I haven't met a L'Occitane product I didn't like.  I first got turned on to L'Occitane through a hotel I stayed at and I've been a huge fan ever since.,1
Did see that much of a change after 2 weeks. There are cheaper products that do the same.,0
"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1
"I researched various eyelash enhancers and this was rated high with a lot of reviewers which is why I chose this product.  Unfortunately, not many reviewers had issues with this product.  Many reviews did not mention side effects.  So I thought, huh, must be fine.  Nope.  The first day, I applied it on at night.  I had no problems.  The 2nd time I used it, I used it in the morning before going to work.  Around lunchtime, my eyes felt dry and irritated.  People noticed that my eyes were bloodshot and looked like I had been crying.  I thought this must be a fluke.  So I gave it another chance a week later.  I applied it on at night.  Woke up and well, same thing.  Puffy red and bloodshot eyes throughout the day.  It took all day for it to subside.  I was so excited to use this product only to have to return it.  Amazon of course let me return it with no problems.",0
"Poor tanning product, and I've experimented with many products over the years. Hardly had results in first day and when it did work it turned more orange than tan! Also snagged my age spots and made then appear darker! Some self tanners do not do that , BUT this one really does it ! yuk!",0
Delivered on time. Leaves my face feeling refreshed.,1
"Too rich for my skin, leaves little white deposits under the skin.",0
"I absolutely loved the way this nail polish looked on, and got it in other colors! I wore it all the time for a few weeks, and then all of a sudden my nails were constantly breaking and very weak! Because of the matte style, it is not supposed to be used with a base coat. I found once I stopped using this nail polish and went back to OPI my nails stopped breaking. It is too bad because it looked great!",0
Amazing cream.,1
"I didn't notice much of a color change, but perhaps didn't use as regularly as I should have. It's an awesome idea, but it gets cold standing soaking wet with the water turned off for three minutes, waiting on this product. It did not streak at all tho, which I loved! Worth a try for someone dedicated to using it shower after shower. One bottle does last a decent amount of time, too.",1
"Now, I owned this product already (purchased directly from Julep) and LOVE it. This was an additional one to keep in my travel makeup bag. It looks identical to my other one, but will NOT sharpen pencils! It's almost like the sharpener part is only slightly larger... the pencils just spin and spin. But my original one will sharpen those same pencils. Quite puzzling.",0
i've struggled with adult acne for the last year and and heard the pink solution is a miracle cure but this kit did not work for me at all. i'm saw a dermatologist and am now on acutane,0
Does not dispense properly!!,0
I really like it but I have found store brands that do as well for half the price.,1
"Light, Sat on more like thick baby powder. Not for me.",0
Terrible!,0
"Not a fan of the smell or the product performance. It felt like a gel when dried and there was ZERO chance of reworking it, even with water added. There are far better water based pomades out there; would not buy/recommend this product.",0
"I found this to leave my skin feeling greasy as well as having a strong, somewhat cloying fragrance that persisted.  I have used two other moisturizers from Guinot and was very pleased--they absorbed quickly and their fragrances were pleasant without lingering.",0
If you don't have sensitive skin this product may be great for you....but my skin is very sensitive and using the product gave my skin blemishes.,0
"Do not care for this product....The device itself is inoperable.
Does not spray well.
No, I would not recommend it.",0
The color was definitely as advertised.  But it  goes on strange and doesn't last very long. It's like Burt's Bee amateur hour. . I love Stila products but I won't buy this again. I actually find myself avoiding it now.,0
"This stuff is the best. There might have been other factors that contributed to this, but I used this product my entire pregnancy and didn't get a single stretch mark. I got a couple red marks on the areas I didn't apply it to (thighs). But once I noticed them, I started putting the oil on that area as well, and they cleared right up. I also like that it's super moisturizing without being oily. I still use it all over my body even after having my baby. It's a little pricey but 100% worth it.",1
It works very well. Leaves hair shinny and soft for many days.,1
Anything Milkshake is incredible. I must say I do prefer the leave incondition over this tho. Smells awesome,1
"Changed formulas, awful",0
Product is fake,0
It just just doesn't exfoliate the skin that well. A decent cleanser though. But nothing can replace Pernox unless some company decides to produce it again.,1
"What more can one say?  It's Proaso, and it smells and lathers great!",1
What happened to the price love this product but can get the same results from a product less then this price?,0
If you are looking for the same scent as the diffusers look elsewhere.  These aren't nearly the same lovely scent.  They are a very watered down version.  Not worth the money.,0
"I have been looking for a flat iron WITH a comb for a long time and am SO happy I chose this one! I have fine, platinum colored processed hair that is stick straight in the front and curly in the back (genes, go figure...?) so I was curious how well this would work. I love it!! This made my entire head smooth, shiny, soft and I think a lot has to do with the comb feature. It's nice to have a temp setting as well as my last one did not have that feature and was just too blazing hot which contributed to some major damage.

As far as any 'plastic' smell coming from the device, I had that too but only for a brief moment as it was heating up for the first time. Have used it several times since with no smell. And as one user mentioned that they didn't blow dry their hair prior to using (they air-dried), I decided to try it and I'll be damned but it came out perfect!

I most def recommend this flat iron to anyone who has been seeking just the right iron as it clearly works wonders on all hair types.",1
"IT HAS A VERY CHALKY FEELING ON THE LIPS, NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.",0
"My fault for not paying attention to the ounces, but this is 1.7 oz and I paid $20 for it.  There are other brands less expensive and just as effective.  I would not buy this again.",0
"It does a decent job of producing lather, nothing more.",1
"I've had this for quite some time and used it rarely because it was just too hot (even on medium, low provided no heat) and seemed to damage my hair.  When my other hair dryer died on me, I got this one out again and used it this morning.  It burned and melted a chunk of my hair.  I spent 15 minutes trimming melted globs out of my hair.  So, obviously, I do not recommend it.  My stylist uses the exact same hair dryer and his is fine.  So I'm guessing it's a quality control issue.  If you MUST get one and have a feeling that it's too hot or not working as it should, stop using it before you set your hair on fire.",0
Overall not bad but stings my skin a bit.,1
The worst shampoo I ever used. It made my hair lost seriously! Totally not match with its description!! Waste money!! A really bad experience!!,0
"After using this iron almost daily for 8 months, the tool overheated to a dangerous temperature.  The hand temperature was normal, but  first piece of hair I tried to curl, smoked and burnt into thousands of small pieces.  So much hair fell out of my iron that the bathroom sink was filled!  The tool was so hot that it was still hot to the touch after 10 minutes.  I am lucky that the iron did not start on fire.  I'm also lucky I have very thick hair.  A thin hair individual would be missing a huge section of hair!",0
Does everyrhing you need it to do leaves skin feeling fresh and smooth,1
"I'm not sure if this is authentic.  I've had this shampoo before that I purchased through a Paul Mitchell hair salon and loved it. This bottle, however, makes my hair very greasy. I even gave it to my mom to try, who has very dry hair, and it also made her hair greasy.  It does smell the same, from what I can tell, but it makes my hair a greasy mess.",0
"It's very good. My hair is very soft when I  used this one. I like it. The smell also good. The price inexpensive ,u can try it",1
My favorite neutral.,1
Rollers did not stay hot or curl my hair.,0
Great product,1
"I love this idea because I can use so many product. If it is good, I will buy full size. I think it will save my money.",1
it does a good job with my curly hair. I don't have to scrunch my hair to much to get it to curl,1
"The brush does not oscillate.  It just makes noise, even with a second new brush.  Amazon was kind enough to accept the return, but I went through all the reviews before deciding to buy another, and noted that according to one, several units have had the same problem.  I think I will be better off buying one from Clarisonic directly, as the return period is 90 days instead of 30 days for Amazon.",0
I have tried other products but none of them can do the job like this one. Best one used I ever used. It is small and easy to carry in a small makeup bag. I will never use any other one except Japonesque Go Curl Pocket Lash Curler.,1
"Can't see much of a difference in my under eye dark circles, it may have improved them a little but it's not worth the price.",0
good product well packed,1
Does what it says!,1
"Great hairdryer, timely delivery",1
good product,1
I love the smell ,1
"This color is so beautiful. I am enjoying it and all the moisturizing benefits that it gives to
my lips. Jane is the Best!

Cheryl",1
"Super fast drying time. Nice and smooth results. Cut my drying time in half.  Just wish it wasn't so heavy and the on/off switch proves to be a bit difficult,",1
This shaver has stopped working after several months of light use. When it did work the product was mediocre. The construction is of very poor quality.,0
It barely looks like I have mascara on!,0
Excellent product the only complain was with the rapper did not lock the pomp and was spilt in side the box.,1
"These clippers worked great for the first 6 uses.
When the charger stopped working, I contacted them to find/buy a replacement part.
The company doesn't offer any parts and must replace the entire unit. So....if you don't have your receipt for the 45$ trimmers you bought two months ago, they use a serial number of the manufacture date. You can be guaranteed, they have been on the shelf longer than the warranty covers (probably took longer to ship from manufacturing).
I find it ridiculous that these are a disposable item that Conair doesn't stand behind. It's poor customer service and incredibly wasteful.
I will choose my brand more carefully next time.",0
Didn't even feel drying at all. Didn't make any difference to my pimples at all.,0
Essie is my favorite polish ....... love all the different colors.,1
"This item is bootleg.  It is not the real thing!  I have used this product for over ten years.
What I received is not the real hair gel.  It smells different, is a different color, different consistency, different viscosity and does not work...period.
There is a cheaper generic version of this product at off brand stores.  My guess is that this supplier refills empty containers with a knock off or homemade blend.  Buyer Beware!!!!!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paul-Mitchell-The-Cream-Conditioner-6-8-Ounce/dp/B001BNI6M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paul Mitchell The Cream Conditioner, 6.8-Ounce</a>",0
It says it's Lily of the Valley but it doesn't smell anything like it.  It's not a good smell at all and I'm not even going to use it.  Don't waste your money on this product.  Buy your Lily of the Valley from Woods of Windsor.  I have some of their liquid soap and some of their spray scent and both are lovely.,0
"I read all the reviews about dozens of hair dryers, going from the typical grocery store 29.99 hair dryer to all the high end models. Having a processed hair which now I'm growing longer and doing everything in my power to make it healthier and strong, a good quality hair dryer, one that doesn't burn my hair but does the job in minutes is crucial.
You will not regret this purchase, believe me.",1
"Product shows up nicely initially, but almost absorbs or goes away as the day goes on. I prefer the Bumble & Bumble Color Spray.",1
Received this item today and it was marked NEW...This clearly was NOT new. Box was old as dirt and product wasn't even sealed. Def returning this.,0
A classic scent at half the price of department stores!!  I always get compliments when I wear it!,1
The flat iron was as hot on the outside as it was on the internal plates. BURNED MY FINGERS!! Fire hazard. Sent back.,0
I bought this because I love grandelash.  This product smelled so terrible I could not use it.  Total waste of money.  I love the lash formula and hope they can come out with a hair growth formula that doesn't smell like strong perfume.,0
"Horrible product. I don't get how this product has so many 5 star reviews. Maybe I got a fake one, but this product does not work. It made my nails super yellow, no matter what color I used. I have posted a picture of my nails below. It looks even more yellow in person.",0
"I bought this from Costco in January and have been using it as directed since then, so 9 months. I am the ideal candidate, fair skin with dark hair.  It has worked marginally at best. I'm still shaving all areas and just have a slight decrease in hair. I use the highest setting at this point. Although this unit is suppose to be a lifetime of flashes, it's dimmer now than when I bought it. Overall would not recommend as results are barely noticeable.",0
"I've been using Glo pressed for many years now. I have always have acne and now adult acne due to adrenal fatigue (insomnia and hormonal imbalanced). Glo pressed doesn't break me out eventhough it has Tocopherol. They did not state Tocopherol Acetate (which is safe for acne prone). I even use this to the gym. The only problem is finding the true colors. Yes they have so many, but the colors still off. I have Honey Light (Jessica Alba skin, on me I look beige with a hint of pink), Honey Medium (it's tan, but not dark, yellow/olive undertone), Golden Dark (recent purchase, suit for NC 30 skin, yellow undertone), Golden Medium (past purchased, it's light, perfect for NC 20 or NC25, chinese/japanese/korean/caucasian skin).

Don't use Bare Minerals if you have acne!!!! I still find Glo Minerals pressed the best mineral out there, compared to Youngblood (so sheer), Illuminaire (too thick/sticky and beige color, not really for asian yellow skin). The Glo loose not for acne skin, it's more for dry skin).",1
Thank you! Good product and fast shipping.,1
This is supposed to leave a matte finish but it just leaves your face super oily.,0
"This is great cologne. I fell in love with it the first time I smelled it. I however, hate how it completely decipates after 3-4 hours, and I have to apply it twice a day. This, coupled with its high price and difficulty to find, turned me off completely. I have since switched to HUGO BOSS tonic. Tonic has a very strong ginger note just like this stuff, and smells so similar that no one has noticed that I switched scents. Also, i can get 6.7 ounces of it for $50 on sale. It also lasts the whole day.",1
"OK,  this is the truth as I see it.  This stuff
seems to make NO difference to my nails.  Maybe
it's just my nails.  They break easily,  even though
I'm healthy,  and don't know why.  I have used this
for a few weeks and see NO difference.  Maybe it would
make a difference on your nails.",0
"It was the same scent but a significantly lighter smell than the bottle I bought from Amazon. At first I was a bit apprehensive not buying directly from Amazon. But I gained confidence from seeing this seller's overwhelmingly positive ratings. Plus $39 seemed like a deal for the big bottle. I guess I got my money's worth, huh? I'm quite disappointed. I wouldn't buy from this seller again.",0
The curling iron took a while to heat up to highest setting and it still wasn't hot enough.  I had to wait a long time for it to curl.  Not what I wanted.,0
Very nice looking and it really looks professional. Heats quickly and has several settings. The only problem I have is the stand. It tips the iron forward leaving the hot iron touching my counter.  I don't want the hot iron resting on my counter thinking it might burn so I leave the wire at the end of the iron hang off the counter and it seems to balance the iron properly. It also comes with several extra springs. I've never had to replace springs on any iron and I use irons for years so I question this. There's also an order form to order more springs.,1
Worked well.  The dark brown is ALMOST black,1
Have no clue what this does to my face. Been using it but don't notice any difference.,0
worth the bucks,1
Stinks smells horrible my worst purchase by far,0
Bottle arrived dented. No packing slip. $30 way too expensive for 8 ounces. Sorry I bought it,0
Feels nice after shaving.,1
"I've been using this for 3 months and haven't noticed ANY difference, and I have light skin and dark hair! waste of money!",0
"I bought this product to help with my bumpy elbows and back of my thighs and rare end.  However, during the summer I shave my legs quite often.  A lot of times I will shave everyday.  The directions state that you should not use on recently shaved skin.  So I must ask, how and when can you use this product to see results? I tried to use it the evening and even the next day after shaving and was in total pain from the stinging and burning of my skin.",0
Hair got stuck inside the machine. Had to cut it out!!,0
At first I was very excited about it. I thought it did the job and it looked very nice on my skin. But one day I took a mirror that magnifies  the face 10x and my skin looked different. I do do this sometimes as I have very fair skin and must wear sunscreen. We wear sunscreen to protect our skin from the sun from sun damage but I think that some sunscreens are too strong and these sunscreens can also do damage.,0
"This lotion was not what I expected.  It was thicker and oilier than I thought it would be, and the scent was not appealing to me- smells a little too plastic. Still, with it being winter, I thought it would keep my newborn's skin soft and moisturized.
Alas, after application, she broke out in a red rash. Tried it again after a few days passed to confirm it was this lotion.
Thankfully, Amazon has excellent returns program and I was able to return for a full refund.
Bought ""Noodle and Boo Super Soft Lotion"" and love it.",0
"Sadly, to my mind, this product had no effect one way or another. Based on reading other reviews, I got the idea that this might really be effective. FOr me, it was no different than other hair products I have used, and worse than some.",0
lathers nicely.,1
Came with the seal opened and half dry product.  Will be asking fro a refund.,0
Not Very powerful and brush is too soft!  Waste of good money,0
"I have no problem spending obscene amounts of money on skin care products in search of that Fountain of Youth. So far I have been pretty disappointed. This product has gotten some pretty high level reviews and after careful consideration I purchased it. The packaging was legit, it was sealed, taped up and indisputably the authentic deal. It seems like some people have been getting questionable products out there. I was prepared to be bowled over by an ungodly stench, but it smells gourd-like, like a fermenting melon, not too bad.

I'm definitely noticing my skin aging, loss of elasticity, enlarged pores, inability to retain moisture. I've purchased and used expensive products like La Mer, Shiseido even straight vaseline. I started using this a few weeks ago. I can't properly describe the effect, but after putting it on, a bit of a tingle or sting usually accompanies it, but my skin feels protected by it. It seems to stay on the surface, and it feels binding. My skin looks smoother, plumper and seems to appear more wholesome. I don't know if that makes sense, but I like the way it feels. I don't know if the effects are lasting, but I'll continue to use it up and if my skin retains a more youthful appearance then I'll definitely buy more.

I know some people are opposed to the ingredients, but seriously, cosmetics have a notorious past of blinding bunnies and torturing kittens. If this indeed is produced from the by products of circumcision then I'm glad some good can come of it. That is a procedure decided upon by parents, not aestheticians, anyways, placenta has long been used by hospitals to heal wounds and hasten healing. If you are morally opposed then do your research and make your own decision. I think this seems like a beneficial product and if I still like it in a few months then I may have found my magical Fountain of Youth product after all!",1
The strap its too thin and short. Does not have any cushioning for the shoulder. I would not recommend this product to any of my friends,0
Very thick. Cakes on.,0
"I was convinced that I was going to love ""Fresh Frog of Belair"" because I love Kermit and I love OPI. I was sorely disappointed. I had used ""Gone Gonzo"" and apart from its difficulty of removal I did think that it was a pretty color, but even though this is the ""same"" line, the formula is not similar enough to make this a great polish.

Like ""Gone Gonzo,"" ""Fresh Frog of Belair"" is a clear polish with green microglitter and large silver glitter in it. It took SEVEN coats of this polish to cover my nails, and the coverage is still not good. It looks like a cheap drugstore polish and does not cover the edges of my nail or the tips. It looks like I have been digging in gravel and the manicure is brand new. Like other OPI polishes that have this large silver glitter, the ends of my nails were sharp enough to score glass and I had to file them after they were polished. I had to use two coats of Seche Vite topcoat to make the polish smooth enough not to catch on denim, and these NINE layers of polish will take a full thirty minutes to remove, even when using pure acetone.

The color of the microglitter is a bright, leafy green. The glitter is the same color that you can get in the cheap glitter for arts and crafts that you buy at the grocery store. It is not a deep green, has a yellow undertone, and the silver glitter all but disappears and looks like clear spots in the polish. My boyfriend was not impressed.

I don't recommend this color. ""Gone Gonzo"" and ""Gettin' Miss Piggy With It"" would be better options from the Muppets collection. There are far better greens available from OPI.",0
It made my mouth look like a firey red scar. It's one of those items I need to see before buying.,0
Good,0
"Pevonia moisturizers are great, but the peels are not that effective.",0
"Creates a beautiful and voluminous crease. One of my favoritee eyelash curls,",1
great product better price,1
Love It. Smelled and packaged just like department stores. Arrived quickly. Will purchase again.,1
With prolonged use it does seem to make a little hair grow back but certainly no cure for thinning hair. Does smell nice though.,1
Not moisturizing at all! I am so disappointed in this product. I have to use Murad over top of it. Will never order this again and do not recommend to women with very dry skin!,0
Love it.  Dries quickly and evenly.  I have tried every self tanner out there and this one is the best.  Not too dark. Not too light.  Just right. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I is a little on the expensive side.,1
"So far this blow dryer rocks!
It's the best I've bought and used. It's powerful and dries your hair quickly. And the temperature adjustments are awesome!",1
Makes the blade slide smooth and smells good,1
"I paid three times the price for these gloves compared to another pair because they were called ""MenScience"" gloves. I figured if they were for ""Men"" they would be a larger size. Not so. In fact they are smaller than the other pair I bought. These gloves are tiny. They stretch to fit to a certain degree. But they are way too tight on my hands. Don't be fooled by the ""Men"" label. I mean no disrespect for small folk, but these should be labeled ""LeprechaunScience"" gloves.

I will be returning them.

EDIT: 7/21 OK, I used the other gloves this morning. The ones that were larger than this brand. They too were small, but not as small. A tight fit on my hands, but they loosened up a bit when wet and soapy.  I suppose the MenScience gloves would too. But still, they are not for big hands.",0
Love Love Love the soap but didn't realize I was paying $10. plus shipping for 1 bar of soap:(,1
I like the way it makes my lashes look,1
"Too light, 3 coats didn't cover my imperfections. Probably god for young children",0
"This has to be one of my favorite SPF's of all time, but I especially love it for the summer months. It's not a physical SPF, so the white-cast isn't even a factor. This sinks into the skin quickly, not greasy at all, and does not have a strong scent.  It feels great on the face and does not clog pores or cause breakouts, it actually feels moisturizing. I always purchase these two or three at a time because my family loves to be out in the sun all summer. It's also waterproof which is a MUST during the heat.
Above all else, I really like Supergoop as a company. The wealth of information on their site is very helpful, and I love that they specialize in sun protection, and because of that, they are always looking for ways to make sun protection better. As it is, the U.S.'s initiative to find better ways to protect people from the sun is antiquated at best. So many other countries are way more advanced in this area while in the U.S. we continue to limit the research that would take us further than what we know as physical & chemical sunscreen.

The bottom line is that I very highly recommend this product for adults and children alike.",1
"Seriously, the most beautiful color ever.",1
"This is my second bottle of the product.  My results have not been as good as many who wrote review.  But, as far as eye creams go, this one does go on smoothly, absorb cleanly, and moisturize pretty well.",1
When I opened the package and removed the lid to sniff this parfum it didn't smell too bad. As soon as I sprayed it on  my wrist I wished I hadn't. It reminds me of a bad Avon fragrance from the 70s. I tried to wash it off but it's a long lasting parfum and won't wash off. I find it repulsive. Unless you can get to a store that carries this and sample it I wouldn't recommend buying it.,0
Irritated my eyes. Returned it.,0
"This neutral color would work for most women.  I love this color.  Works well when the eyes have more of a definitive, dramatic look.  This enables the focus on the eyes instead a big lip color.  The gloss is not greasy.  Application wand is soft and easy for application.  This is a regular size lip gloss one can buy at the store.  Recommend without reservations.",1
Love the clean fragrance.,1
The fragrance is beautiful but the soap is water thin. It was too expensive to have such poor consistency.,0
Burned my face. I don't even have especially sensitive skin.,0
I would say this is a better toner then many brands I have tried. Very good for toning blonde hair!,1
Nothing harsh about this product.  I use the moisturizer as well and my sensitive skin feels better than it has in a lomg time.,1
"I have used the Hot Tools curling iron for years, the one I order from Amazon works great as always! I will continue to use this great product!",1
This product removed all eye makeup easily and did not irritate my eyes. Excellent product. The best I've tried.,1
I am apparently allergic to this product. I did not use until yesterday and started to itch. I am surprised there is no option to return this item.,0
I made the mistake of using to much at first but quickly mastered it. It didn't seem to dry as fast as promised but it did expedite the process and  I hate waiting for hours for my nails to dry so I was pleased with the results.,1
"This product comes in an elegant, easy-to-open, jar. A spoon comes with it, in order to easily remove the product from the jar.

The masque, itself, is a thick cream having the consistency of paste. It is not greasy. It has a light, somewhat floral scent.  The masque goes on easily. I found that I didn't have to use a lot of the product either. Because of its consistency, it is easy to apply. I divided my very long hair into sections to make it easier.. Each strand needs to be covered, and using a thick-toothed comb to distribute it evenly is helpful.

Now, for the results. It did tame the frizzies, but it didn't get rid of them all together. It did improve the quality of my hair. It felt softer, stronger, easier to manage. It seemed to be hydrated without feeling greasy.

The product contains essential fatty acids, jojoba oil and vitamin e, all ingredients that are vital for healthy hair.",1
"My girlfriend can't figure out how to use this product, you need a second person to help. This is meant for hairstylists.",0
"doesn't last long and not worth the money. If you have very thinning hair, try something else. You would have to pour a bucket of this on your hair if you want results and you'll just be wasting your money because it will look fake and gone within hours due to sweat and humidity.",0
Very bold perfume. great smell and lasts long,1
Must have for thinning here where you can see your scalp.  I don't leave home without it.  Seriously.,1
It didn't even stay on for a minute!!! Returning ASAP.,0
Very small no powder puff comes with it,0
"I like this product, not greasy and lasts a long time.  Went to the Caribbean and no sunburn!",1
I love it!!,1
Came opened and product was all over the box.,0
"I used other La Roche products before and I loved almost them all. Physiological Cleansing Gel became one of my favorites. I have acne prone, sensitive skin, so when I use acne products, like face wash, my skin tends to get dry and flaky. Not with PCG. My skin never felt so soft before! I am using this product with a mild acne cream and I cannot complain. It is the first time in years that my skin does not get dry while using dermatological products. If you have oily skin, it is likely this product will have to be used in combination with something else that helps to eliminate the oil.",1
Its not that good,0
"Did not have a color spectrum on container as before, was darker and less bronzey",0
"This works just as the label indicates, and the smell is very clean and most agreeable.  It does a great job of adding weight to hair without weighing it down (if that makes sense?), making it more manageable.  It's important to note that this pomade isn't going to glue your hair into place.  I use it to style my hair per usual then finish with Consort men's hairspray.  Highly recommended.",1
"Fast shipping, great price. I knew it was the perfume I was looking for. It's a great perfume, lovely smell, fruity and light at once for everyday occasion.",1
This is so amazing!  I used to have such a hard time getting a streakless tan.  I used this the first time in such a rush. And my tan turned out FLAWLESS!!!,1
This product is a waste of money. First of all it has a gray undertone that is very unflattering. It is not good at all for oily skin despite what they claim. It just melted off my face. And then I broke out with little red bumps after using it twice!,0
If you want a mascara that flakes off and doesn't even last a full work day then by all means buy this one. It goes on nicely and looks nice but it has no lasting power. I feel like I could have bought one at a drugstore for $8 that would be better than this. Expected so much more for the price. Disappointed. I bought a new one from a different brand today to replace it. Boo.,0
Terrible doesnt cover,0
When i opened this bottle lacas 1/4,0
"Amazing stuff. I'm middle age, been coloring, drying and flat ironing my hair for a long time and this stuff is making my hair soft and healthy again. So happy to find it. I ordered the Chi ""Keratin"" silk infusion by accident on ebay and did not like it as well. Does not work as well as this in my opinion.",1
Must have! This is by far my favorite hair product! Love the smell and the texture it gives my hair is great  not too stiff.,1
"I was reading a review of a wife and her misbehaving husband and it made me laugh so much....ok you need to be aware on how to use this product. First its for bald spots not for the fully bald or 80% bald. To keep it in place use hair spray. Don't go to bed with it in your hair as it will shake off and you have a dirty pillow the next morning. I would recommend not swimming with the stuff and the gym. I use my wisely, I used a similar product before with a different brand that was a lot more expensive and this is the same stuff for a lot less. So in short it works great, but I would also use a rogaine as well to help fight the good fight for baldness also use a hair thickening shampoo as that also helps as well. Omega 3 also promote stronger hair follicles and possible regrowth. I like this and my wife is happy with the results it brings for my bald spot.",1
"I had been reading the ads for this for two years, but didn't want to spend the $85.95 on a product I had not sampled.  Was happy Amazon had it for less, but I should have known that one product can never be the ALL to every skin type.  After using for four days, I looked twenty years older!  It did not firm, so my skin became saggy.  My wrinkles all became prominent and my skin tone was dull.  I went back to my REAL skin cream and some of the damage is gone.  It has been some time since I encountered such a complete failure in a product, did not firm, did not make me radiant, did cause redness it was suppose to cure, did not make my skin so toned I could wear less make-up.  The only use I found for it is a slight bleaching effect on dark spots, but other creams are more effective for that.  I can only state that if the glowing reviews are from actual users and not the company, then I just had a bad reaction to something in it, or more likely it is for very oily skin which mine is not.  If you decide to order be aware it is very drying.",0
"If you order Shade 02, when it arrives you may be tempted to think there was a terrible error at the factory because it looks really orange in the bottle.  Rest assured that it does not look orange on your face.

Although it goes on fairly sheer, there is a peach tint to it so if peachy shades look good on you, Shade 02 might be a good color for you.  The color is sheer but the shimmery bits are not and they show up the most.

I've worn this two different ways.  I have mixed a little bit in with the tinted moisturizer I use as foundation.  In the mirror at home I didn't notice much difference but under the fluorescent lights of the office, my face looked noticeably glowing and shimmery -- perhaps more shimmery than I prefer for work but not so much that anyone commented on it.  I also have just put it on the cheekbones as suggested on the Amazon catalog page.  I noticed that much less at work and almost could not tell in my bathroom mirror.  It will take some playing around with this to get the right level of luminosity without being too shimmery.

Update:  The more I have used this, the more I like it so I raised this by a star.  I now use it exclusively mixed in with my tinted moisturizer. With practice I have gotten the balance just right so I have a glow but don't look too shiny.  The other day one of my co-workers commented that I had a glow about me -- and I fessed up that it was due to this product more than anything.",1
"I've used this before in cosmetology school, thisx is a great brand. I apply to wet hair after serum them blow dry and style. If you don't think it works, spray some on your arm and blow dry , then apply heat to an area without the protectant. You'll feel the difference. Make sure you shake well before using.",1
"never cleansing. if i apply just sunblock, i would be ok. but almost non-cleanseing about normal make up..so dissapoint...",0
The product I received in the mail was an oval shaped barrel for zig zag waves. This is not what was advertised or what the pictures were of. The product also looked used and had a sticky substance on it.,0
"I have lighter brown hair, not thick but a little wavy. I haven't had luck with this holding the curls past 2-3 hours even with hairspray, mousse, etc. I hardly ever use it, but will try every once in a while hoping maybe, just maybe it'll work this time...but it never does. I always go back to my Sedu Revolution wand, which holds for hours - but I don't want to let go of another $100+ for a bigger sized barrel.",0
"I love Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum. It's great. This is second bottle I bought.

But 'Deals on Demand' packed it wrong, so serum leaked a lot when it arrived.",0
I like it ... a little gritty on my face but still nice and I have used it a few times.,1
"(Review written 8 months after purchase)...This is a reasonably priced Babyliss. Its construction is light weight and for long drying times is nice. The construction lacks in giving you that Professional Babyliss feel, but I believe the price dictates that. This dryer does heat evenly during use, but is not a high heat blow dryer. I have fine hair and is the exact reason I purchased the dryer. I travel frequently with it and it travels well even though the handle doe not articulate.",1
Love this color. Really wears well. Just a color that is a little different.,1
the only foundation I have found that does not look orange on my fair complexion,1
"I can simply say I am disappointed with this product. It falls through to your scalp, itches, and comes out under your finger nails when you scratch your head. I did not see where it attached to my hair, it just colored my scalp to match my hair.",0
"This moisturizer delivers on its promises! It's super nourishing and refreshes my skin. I went without it for about a month and noticed a real difference in my skin -- back to dull, dry patches and prone to some really fine lines on my forehead. The Lactic Acid definitely isn't drying or strong, instead it soothes my mild/occasional break-outs. This formula is perfect; its lightweight and does not leave any excess oil, which doesnt clog pores in my problematic T-zone. Its perfect for sensitive skin as it gently and naturally exfoliates. This minimizes uneven skin tone and leaves a smooth soft texture; this is truly my Holy Grail moisturizer!!!",1
Made my hair dry and frizzy,0
Didn't work when arrived. Had to return.,0
LORAC hits it outta the park with this massive success.  Shadows are soft and perform well for blending.,1
"Superior clumping and smoothing of my frizzy, 3b/c porous curls! Loses 1 star due to strong fragrance and price. Though strong, the fragrance does not trigger my allergies/asthma like many other products do. Other negatives is that it is difficult to use the right amount so that you get the benefits without your hair feeling tacky and gunky. My natural hair texture is really frizzy though, especially in humidity, so some of you with less frizz or in dry climates can probably get away with using a small amount of this and avoiding the tacky feeling this can cause. Even with the cons, I've purchased this 3 times now because it is more smoothing than any leave-in I have tried, and I have tried tons of products. As I'm aging, my hair has been thinning a bit and I have these individual strands that are shorter than the rest and stick out. This conditioner, used as a leave-in, does an excellent job of calming them down so they blend in and clump with the lengths of my hair. It is also my go-to after a bad, too-short haircut, because if I use a lot of it, it smooths my hair to the point where the curls are looser and don't shrink much, so it looks longer. I have not tried this by itself, I use a gel, mousse or cream over it as it's summer and my hair needs lots of protection from humidity, but I suspect it can hold up on its own when the weather's dry. This is worth the price!",1
"I am very impressed.  This oil goes on smoothly and quickly absorbs into your skin.  Make-up all but evaporates.  I experienced no burning around the eyes when I used it to clean off mascara.

Clean up just requires a warm wet washcloth.  My skin usually feels tight after I've washed it so I almost always apply a moisturizer immediately afterwards.  Not so with this treatment.  I won't give up my night cream, but I'll be looking forward to letting my skin breathe through the effects of this potion for a few hours before bed.

There's no overpowering fragrance.  A little goes a long way, so this bottle is generously sized.  Certified organic.",1
"Can't live without this, fantastic for sensitive skin, very refreshing too.",1
"Some things work for some, and sometimes,not for others. This one just did not work for me. Seemed like I had more hair coming off every time I used it. Oh well...it was an experiment that did not produce the desired results.",0
Great price.,1
"My experience was similar to ""Michelle E""s review dated 3/23/17.  I have used this conditioner off and on for a couple months, not every time I shampoo though, which is probably why it took so long to figure out various skin bumps on my shoulders, upper back and the front of my neck. They take a while to heal, not like hormonal acne or a food allergy. Some have looked like hives, some bumps are the size of pimples, and a couple were small patches comprising a few tiny bumps. They all cause quite a bit of redness around them.  I purchased this conditioner at J.C. Penney's salon that carries Matrix Biolage products, and it had a seal on the top of the bottle (under the cap), so my reaction was not due to product tampering.  Furthermore, it didn't do much for my hair as far as conditioning it, so I won't re-purchase.",0
"So, I have been looking for a body wash that moisturizes well and cleans well. I have to say that I don't particularly care for those mesh sponge things. As a guy, i like to really wash and scrub everywhere ( how the hell do people wash their backs with those things?) really well. Guys, you all know those things don't wash your ""business"" like a rag will. Anyway, i really like the smell of this stuff but there is no lather at all if you use a wash cloth. It's almost like washing your body with...milk?

It seems like most of the more natural products that don't have so many sulfates blah blah blah really suck on the lather tip because you have to add the bad stuff to really make the lather. If you use a mesh sponge, you will probably love this stuff though. If you use a wash cloth, get ready to pour half the bottle on your rag to get a little soap. For how much this stuff costs, they need to find some kind of way for suds to appear.",0
DO NOT BUY. This is not the real product! False advertising. I will be returning this product.,0
"I have fine hair, so a detangler helps. This detangler is light-weight, not greasy or heavy and adds shine to my hair. It works fast. About 5 spritzes does the trick!  Love it!",1
"Disappointed; has not worked at all for me yet. I was a very happy Latisse user for 5+ years, but it stopped working for me (apparently this happens and you have to stop using it for a while and try again after a year or so)
I've been using this RevitaLash daily for 3 weeks and it hasn't done anything for my lashes.  I was so excited to try it after reading all of the great reviews but I am having exactly the opposite experience. :( Im going to give it another week and then Im getting extensions if it doesn't start doing something.",0
"Very nice cream, lovely packaging and a great gift to give out of a little luxury that one would not usually buy for themselves.",1
Lousy crashes quickly ..,0
For me it did not work. I don't like neither the ingredients in it nor the way it affects my hair.,0
If the pads were tougher I would give them 5 stars. Unfortunately the pads are so flimsy they are basically unusable. They are too soft to do any exfoliating and just sort of wet skin with good smelling juices. I'd advise buying a sample before buying the whole pack.,0
This diffuser does not even fit the matching blow dryer.,0
"It really didn't do anything. I read that it would really dry out your skin. I actually did not notice a difference. However, I did notice a big different when I used a combination of their other products. So don't let this product ruin the brand for you! It is a very good brand. The products work very well. However, I did not have luck with this one.",0
"I loved Crabtree & Evelyn""s hand recovery so I thought the hand therapy cream would be just as good. I was wrong. The cream absorbs nicely with no greasy feel and it also smells very good.

However within 2 weeks of having the bottle the spray nozzle on the top came off so until I find a new one.. its quite useless to me:/ But I take mine everywhere with me & it couldn't handle it I guess",1
Love it,1
Not happy with product at all.  Too glittery.  Seems like a product much more for a teenager.  Very disappointed.,0
Great color.,1
"This is the best skin care routine I've run across for my face. The oil smells lightly of citrus, and when washed off with the charcoal sponge and warm water, leaves my skin soft, clean and moisturized.",1
Does what it should,1
"Omg, the price just doubled!!!! I can't believe it! I have really sensitive skin, have been using this product for a while. Don't do any good, but at least don't make my skin itchy. But I don't I want to pay that much for this little package. Only last me 2 months. Time for look something other product I think!",0
"Love, love, love this product!!",1
works well! wash my nail polish quick. despite nasty smell...,1
Brush arrived broken...had to spend 5 mins trying to reassemble the middle piece from the outer piece. I finally got it and used it twice and seems fine. Annoying though cause I bought clarisonic brand and paid the extra money. Had nothing to do with shipping..it obviously wasn't put together to start with,0
I have used the cream for about a month and noticed no change. My eye lashes are a medium length and I just wanted a little more fullness-but no change so far.,0
"Here's a hint: the bodyshop sells ""frizz ease"" for about $16 for 75ml, it is less sticky than Moroccan oil and I prefer it. Also if you ever go to Thailand you can get a similar product for 100 Thai Baht (about $3) in the Boots chemists that are everywhere. They have Brazil nut oil and lots of variations. I've found both of these tame my frizzy hair and give it a lovely shine better than Moroccan oil does. Can't believe what a chump I was to pay all that money for it!",0
EY IE,1
I started seeing improvement after the 2nd use. My son still has a little bit of cradle cap but not as much as before.,1
Cheaper than what was in stores and exactly what I expected. Arrived on time and nice because it had the pump!,1
"Non damaging non toxic beautifying sun block! I like it -no muss,no fuss",1
"Not a huge fan of the smell, and you can find more quality products and a lesser price!",0
"I don't know why, but once I tried this product about 10 years ago, I've never stopped using it! I love it!",1
"I ordered this thinking it was going to be a good match to my complexion.  I have warmer skin with yellow tones and I have used Loreals honey beige true match foundation, which matches really well.  This honey beige is really dark and more peachy than honey. It did not match well with my complexion at all.

It was also rather thin and did not cover very well. I couldn't really use it to see how long it lasted because my face looked horrendous with on (as it was too dark) so I cant comment on its staying power.  A plus was that it was fragrance free, as promised.",0
"The color is not pink as it looks on the site.  It is more like a natural nail color shade.  Like a light cream color.  However, the color isn't the main complaint.  I actually liked the color but it was very streaky.  I applied 3 coats to try and get rid of the streaks but it didn't work.  I left it on for 6 days and it did last.  However, if you are looking for more of a pink color and you don't want streaks then this is not right for you.",0
This is not worth buying. Most of the Products that are not useful. Too many cologne samples.,0
Did not curl my straight hair. Hair gets stuck in it. Takes forever.,0
"This product gives great coverage, using a very small amount of product. It is creamy, but stays where it is placed all day. I use it as an eyelid primer as well as a first layer of under-eye concealer. I have very dark circles,and so need a color corrector before the skin-colored concealer.

Would recommend to anyone needing an excellent eyelid primer, or anyone needing to conceal dark under-eye circles.",1
"Received a brown taupe rather than a rose, would like the pink to be sent out",0
"This blush is a very pretty color. I have fair skin and blush sometimes looks too dark on my skin. Not so with the Georgie blush. It gives me a glow, which is what I want. It's very creamy but not greasy. And I couldn't smell any fragrance. It's easy to apply with your fingers, makeup sponge or brush. It's perfect for a natural glow.",1
"My wife saw this on a morning show and liked the looks of it, so I bought it for her birthday.  Once seeing it ""in real life"" she realized it wouldn't work for her, as she likes to put ice in her water bottle and the opening is not large enough for ice.  No problem, we'll return it.....but wait....this item is not eligible for returns.  Wait, what?  I buy from Amazon constantly, and this is the first time that has ever happened to me (unless I waited too long, which is my fault).  I guess we blew almost $50 for a trendy ""warm"" water bottle.",0
"Working good so far-
Not clear if it helps mature skin though. Will wait and see",1
I really like this shampoo and use often to clean my hair when is oily due to the humidity or other reason. It does a good job. The scent is pleasant and clean.,1
Great product,1
"The Transformation Ultra is a thick, creamy lotion with almost no unpleasant chemical odor that I find with some self-tanners. Instead, it had a cucumber melon scent. I found it a bit too sweet and strong, but far better than the smell of chemicals.

The lotion is thick and easy to apply. However, it goes on sheer and does not provide an instant tan like some of the other XEN-TAN products, and I ended up missing a spot the first time I used it. I applied it with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/XEN-TAN-Deluxe-Tanning-Mitt/dp/B002UOCTSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">XEN-TAN Deluxe Tanning Mitt</a>. It is not necessary to use the mitt, but it did a nice job keeping my hands clean and was easy to rinse out. The mitt is sold separately and lasts through multiple applications.

This tanner reaches full color after about 10 hours. It takes about an hour to dry and does not rub off until it is rinsed with water. I waited the full time before rinsing it off and the result was a deep, dark color tan which lasted almost a week. It faded naturally until the last few days when it became a little splotchy.

I tried again, this time only leaving the tanner on for an hour before rinsing. The color was much nicer this time and more in line with my normal skin tone. And this time it faded evenly.

I've tried many tanning products over the years with varying levels of success and find that XEN-TAN makes some of the best.",1
This product help me every morning to match my color skin.  Giving me a smooth and cleaner appearance.  Really love it,1
"Good hairspray, GREAT fragrance!",1
Smudged on first try and every try after. I just want an eyeliner that will stay put and not transfer to to top of my eye! Ugh!,0
"Do you like spreading salve on a dry face that warms and burns? How about a residue that remains, even after washing with a muslin cloth?  What about large red spots that linger for days on your precious visage?  If so, you will love Glamtox Cleanser!

This product promises so much and delivers the worst complexion I have ever had.",0
I absolutely love this oil.  It goes silky soft without being greasy and has a lovely soft scent.  I'm thinking this would be a great gift for Mother's Day!,1
Smell was too strong. I have sensitive skin and eczema. I was willing to ignore the smell if it would help with my dry skin but it did not in the several days I used it. The smell became too much of a nuisance.,0
"Always my go-to face cleanser. All natural ingredients, lovely light citrus fragrance, and it really does keep your face clean and clear. Is great at removing makeup and a little goes a long way. Highly recommend.",1
I think thats very BAD FOR MY HAIR! I want to give back.,0
"Lotion is OK but pricey.  I've found some better, less expensive brands that work well for my combination, acne prone skin.  Dispenser is finicky and hard to control.  Too much lotion is released, causing product waist.  Because the dispenser is the kind that is sealed, there is a lot of (expensive) left over lotion that is thrown away. Package needs improvement",0
really prettt but arrived broken ,0
Ive tried a lot of this curling irons so i didn't expect much from this one and unfortunately i was right it burned my hair and after half an hour i had straight hair again so the curls didn't last long. Sorry cause i cannot return it but i would.,0
Hard to use,0
"Like the Germans, these blades are little stiff; however, sharp.",1
"I'm not a fan of this mascara, especially for the price. It leaves clumps in my eyelashes and I would definitely not recommend it.",0
"I really like their shaving cream, but this was not my favorite- it is pretty greasy and the tip always gets clogged every morning with a chunk of material from the past morning.  I would say look for something else.",0
I tried to dry polish but couldn't dry it by nail dryer. It made wrinkles and had to wait long to dry my nail. I didn't like the color too.,0
"Perfume itself is not so bad, but the bottle made from cheap glass. One day i just found out it is cracked by itself.
Extremely lower level, arguing and against-the-customer BURBERRY`s support.",0
It appears that Paul Mitchell products dry out my hair.  I will not purchase Paul Mitchell in the future.,0
"Much thicker and more substantial than the watery one I had been using.

Goes on more like a lotion.

Works well, so I am pleased with the results so far.

No skin irritation",1
"Is help with the oil in the zone T face, but when your apply in the neck, after 2 or hours is turning like white color, just in the neck.",0
"This is the best clay pomade I have used. After D:fi reformulated their d:strict fiber, I tried a few things before settling on this product. The matte finish is exactly what I want, and it holds better than anything else I have tried.",1
Great brand but wrong product for me. I exchanged for another Lorac foundation.,1
It definitely makes your skin soft but using this gave me some of the worst acne of my life!,0
"I love Avene!  Yet, this cream turns skin a bit to greenish-bluish.  Next time I will get it without the color correction.",1
The silk infusion  was clear thin and white unlike the one I bought before thick and gold. this looked and smelled funny.,0
"I'm not a big sweater and have always hated the choice of either no protection or yellow undershirts.  No more do I have to make that choice.  This does as advertised, although when applying fresh out of the shower do leave some discomfort for 10-15 minutes.

Works as advertised, I'm happy.",1
I have very dry lips so I tried.  Typical chapstick.  Nothing special.,0
I like their hand cream and thought this will be equally good but this is ok.,0
"This dryer blew hot air for a few minutes, and then only blew cool air, and would cut on and off between hot and cool air.  When I sent it back to the Company, they said they tested it and it was fine.  Cannot believe what bad business they represent by saying that.  It absolutely was an inadequate product, and it is my guess they put it back in stock for someone else to purchase.",0
"I wear this daily with the Jack Black Double-Duty Face Moisturizer, one pump mixed with three pumps of the daily moisturizer, leaves a really nice complexion.",1
"It takes a learning curve but this does go on quite nicely. It can be rather expensive, though, because the pods don't last very long",1
Love this stuff!,1
Not as good as the discontinued 60 spf,0
Love this product!  My skin has never been better since using these pads.  Kind of expensive but worth every penny.  No need for facials anymore.  My husband has starting stealing them from me because he loves them too!  Highly recommended!,1
Love this color and application.,1
my daughter has only used this flat iron 2 weeks when it started shutting off while she was using it. I am a hairstylist and Rusk is a pretty repetable line so I was very disappointed in the quality. This is not a product I would purchase again which I was considering getting them for in my salon.,0
"I've tried the butter nail polish before, but have to admit that this is my first time trying their lipstick. I know them as a quality brand, and have to admit, their Plush Rush lipstick does leave me impressed. It comes in a very pretty box, great for gift giving, and the case is black and magnetic, which helps to keep the lid closed.
I tried their 'Lucky' color, which is a pinkish, dusty mauve rose (so on the nude spectrum but with a bit more color). It goes on very smooth and rich, great moisture to it which does last. Not too heavy, though, for all that rich feeling. I did put on a base to help make the color last and lined my lips, and noticed that there's not as thick a color transfer on to my mug as with other lipsticks (say urban decay, Kat Von D or Makeup Forever). I have to admit, not all lipsticks last all day for me, hence why I try a lot to make them last (exfoliate, moisturize, base, lining, etc), and have to say that I do have to touch-up with this one but it does give a little bit of stain to help keep my lips looking as if there is something there, as well as keep them from drying out.
What I don't notice is any 'plumping' effect. No tingling, nothing. But I do give it a lot of points for being moisturizing and great color, as well as no bleeding.",1
This bottle had to have been tampered with.  It smelled like rubbing alcohol,0
Made my inner elbow ceases break out in a stinging raised rash actually woke me up in the middle of the night stinging. Return window closed by 3 days! Disappointing when reviews were good. Wouldn't by again!,0
"I absolutely love this BB cream. I was not sure what to expect, because I have never used a BB cream before, but I love it. It is weightless, looks natural, and does not break out the skin. I do not do not use the Effaclar line, but I do use the Redermic C line, and La Roche-Posay sunscreen.  This layers great over the Redermic C line and Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid. I don't get quite the coverage that is depicted in the picture, and maybe it is because of my layered skin products, but it has decent covered. I do use concealer for my under eye and certain blemishes that need a bit more coverage. I highly recommend.",1
My daughter uses it every day.,1
"My best iron, but I wish the barrel was a bit longer for my super long hair. Love the control I have with the marcel.",1
The formula has been changed and is no longer an effective scrub.,0
This lotion is soothing on the legs right after shaving. Smells nice too! Smoothes out my rough elbows and heels!,1
"I am a medical esthetician  and I love this sunscreen! I tell my patients all the time about this and to go buy it! IT FEELS AMAZING ON THE SKIN!!!!!!!!!! It does not leave a white zinc tint, and it is very hydrating and as it is says very water cooling feel. Awesome product!",1
"It is always so hard to do reviews for items that really have more in the way of long term rather than short term benefits. It is easy to say that I like the way that this makes my skin feel after use and that it definitely gives my skin a healthy, hydrated look. I look a lot younger than my 63 years would lead you to expect and one of the major reasons has been that I've been very careful to keep my skin hydrated and moisturized. I have never smoked and I have always minimized the amount of time that I spend in the sun. While I don't use wide brim hats like I perhaps should, I do religiously put on a baseball cap upon leaving the house. So between doing little damage to m skin in my life style and doing as many healthy things for in the meantime, I think my skin looks better than most people my age. On the other hand, I've been something of a sceptic about the ability of any serum or ointment or cream to repair damage to the skin. I think you can mask damage and there is no question that moisturizing can make a massive difference in the degree to which damage to the skin shows. Now, does this Obagi product help with the appearance of your skin? Unquestionably. My skin both looks very good and feels very good. But is the difference between an Aveeno moisturizer that costs around $13 a bottle and Obagi at almost $80 a bottle enough to justify the enormous difference in cost? Not for me, but if you are in a different economic situation and your conscience isn't troubled by spending so much money on what is essentially a luxury item, it will not do any harm to your skin.",1
"I have been using this duo Glo Minerals for years. I love that it is applied under the eye with out looking cakey. It has two colors, one for under eye and the other for covering blemishes on the face. Glo minerals uses high quality ingredients. I am very prone to acne breakouts, I never have to worry when I use Glo Mineral products. My only gripe is that they do not make a larger size. I tend to go through this in a little over a month.",1
LOVE this. If I use it twice a day I do break out. So I just use it at night.,1
This is wonderful cleanser and the cheapest place to purchase,1
"This shampoo is okay on fine hair, but not great. Would not buy again. It has a pretty strong peppermint oil smell and feels warm on my face if it touches it. Have to be extremely careful to avoid your eyes with the suds.",0
"I really like these products but they are watered down a bit too much, so less creamy.  It smells nice and combined with the shampoo my hair falls out less.  So far, so good!",1
"It is a Christmas gift, which hasn't been used by the recipient, but I was surprised upon receiving it because the box was open.  Meaning it was not taped shut.  No sign of any tape used to seal shut.  Anything could have fallen out.  I believe all the pieces are there, but won't know for sure until late December.",1
"I was really looking forward to trying Juice Beauty Stem Cellular Repair Moisturizer. I've read good things about the company, and I like products which use natural ingredients. The packaging is sleek, and the unique pump-top jar is a neat way to dispense the product. However, as soon as I pumped out some of the cream onto my fingers, I was overwhelmed by the extremely strong lime scent. It smells like an old-fashioned, citrusy men's after-shave. I knew that I could not use the cream anywhere near my face--it made my eyes water. I tried it on my hands, and my skin immediately got hot and itchy. I had to quickly wash the cream off as thoroughly as possible. I have normal, non-sensitive skin, but I had an instant negative reaction to this product. A man with a no skin sensitivities who wants his skin-care and after-shave all in one product may be able to make good use of this moisturizer, but I cannot use this product at all.",0
It sounds like a good idea to use this so that you don't waste the product where you don't need it but the pump takes a lot of pressure in your finger to make it work and then the product shoots out in little dots. I think the X-Fusion product is amazing but have gone back to using the sprinkler container as it is sold without the pump. The product itself works incredibly well at covering up your scalp if your hair is thinnning!,0
I literally had this hair dryer for 1 week - it gently rolled off of my dresser onto a thick rug.  The Motor was defiantely not right and I assumed it would be covered under the warranty - it was NOT.  I had to pay to get if fixed.  The casing around it is loose already - so the quality of the dryer isn not great for the price .  Elchim hairdryer is much better.,0
"Disappointed with product.  My skin felt great for the first 2 weeks but upon further use, I would wake up to wrinkled skin around my eyes.  I stopped using it for a while then resumed and unfortantely the wrinkles came back.  I also attempted to avoid the eye area without any luck.",0
I have been wearing Obession for years and the produce has never let me down as far as people telling me how good I smell (particually men)  I am allergic to a lot of fragrences  but never Obsession.  Will continue to wear the product till my grave and beyond.,1
This was the first time I tried Zoya. It is a wonderful polish. Only needed one coat and it lasted a lot longer than I would have expected. The color is so rich. I am very pleased.,1
"It is bad,It blurs my camera, not even clearer. i tested it on many devices and none of them work",0
"Smells really minty, strong smell but I like it, definitely stick with you, overall not that bad, as opposed to most tea tree products",0
"I love this soap, and I was very excited to find it at such a reasonable price.  My only problem was that the bar was broken when I received it.  Not that big of a deal really, but I wanted to make the seller aware of this incident.",1
"I have blonde highlights & rarely ever straighten/curl my hair. After using this once, it not only took forever to actually make a curl, but in result left a weird brassy residue in my hair that will not come out. My hair dresser didn't even know what to think of it. Also, after one use, my hair now smells TERRIBLE after i take a shower. Needless to say I will be returning this.",0
It actually dried out my lips and made them chapped.,0
"Love this lotion for my hands, I am a nurse and wash often and this lotion helps keep my hands from drying out!!!!",1
Works great as light makeup coverage that includes a moisturizer and sunscreen.  The color matches my complexion perfectly. Perfect for workout days.,1
"This is the first lipstick I have used that does NOT chap my lips.  The colors are sheer and natural, and I reapply about 3 times during the day without having to put liip balm under it.  Thank you Kaplan MD.",1
"The polish I received looks nothing like the one shown for sale. It looks more similar to Essie's ""Play Date."" This was also the first time I've purchased nail polish online. Lesson learned: stick to purchasing polish in person.",0
Leaves my hair very soft,1
Good product.  Don't know if the shipping jarred the lid but it had leak all over box leaving about a fourth of the product in the container.,1
I loved this product when I received it. However only after 8 months the motor went out.,0
"Smells nice, doesn't last all day",1
"I can certainly say that this product did not help. I have struggled for years with skin that is sensitive and breaks out no matter what, especially when aggravated by friction with one thing or another. Often, that's just inevitable, such as with the clothes I'm wearing. It refuses to be cured by anything. Serious problem with redness and hyperpigments exclusively, no scars, just post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, which means very unwanted darkened spots that take months to clear, with treatments that are uncertain in the fact that they rarely work for the large majority of users.

And it's oily all the time. So, clearly, I have very, very problematic skin! This is one of several products I've purchased on Amazon in my quest for a solution. I looked everywhere, exhausting option after option, blacklisting so many products for their ingredients, negative reception or something like that. I'd heard in my rather extensive online research that glycolic acid was a reliable AHA for being a gentle method of speeding up the skin's natural exfoliation process, rather than using abrasive cleansers containing small solids that would very likely irritate my skin and worsen it.

And, I'd heard a lot about salicylic acid being a milder alternative to benzoyl peroxide. One of the other products I purchased was a 5% BP face wash (NEVER use 10 percent!), supposedly developed for sensitive skin. I was confident in it, and what do you know, it made my already horrible skin worse.

So, I turned to this appealing combination product, figuring that if my skin wouldn't tolerate BP, this would be a great alternative. The reviews were excellent. So, how did it work? All I can say for sure is that it didn't. Now, I was using other products in conjunction, namely a moisturizer and face cleanser (Note: neither were Topix brand). I don't know if it was this, one of the others, or maybe the full routine was excessive, but my skin seemed to get more red and became more prone to irritation. It didn't cause any irritation on contact, but my skin felt a little sore consistently and extra susceptible to it.

In conclusion, if you have skin like mine, you might want to stay away from this.",0
Great coverup! I love this line of mineral makeup!,1
"This has a strong perfume smell . I only got a small size to try , but I do like the Divine purple shampoo / conditioner .",0
Its ok. I wake up with flakes all around my eyes though so not sure it absorbs at all. No7 didn't do that and moisturized better. This has no peptides either. Not worth the price.,0
The lights are going out after a month of use.  Product is defective.  I will have to contact the company for replacement.  It would probably be a good product if all the lights lit up and worked correctly.,0
"The picture shown looks a little darker than the actual product, but it still looks good. The lipstick has a nice minty and moisturizing affect.",1
Like puddsing,0
"I received mine a few days ago.  I've tried it 3 times and it only makes very loose curls (and I have above-the-shoulder hair length.)  The timer setting doesn't change the length of time, it stays on about 6 seconds.  I was going to return/exchange it but I think I'll just return it and order something different. (Note: I'm experienced using a curling device like this.)",0
"Most amazing treatment ever. I'm not one to spend $100 on a serum, but I'd do it again. This stuff is gold. I've used plenty of other products with medial results. This stuff is amazing. I noticed a difference after one day! My skin is glowing. Much for even and ""dewy""/shiny. My husband even noticed ( and he still doesn't notice my hair when I change it!). I highly recommend this to all. It tingles a bit for the first 10 min or so, but that's how I know it's working! It was a little uncomfortable the first time two, but now I don't even notice it. I'll buy this again Ann'ands again",1
"I actually love what the product does to my hair, but unfortunately, it doesn't work after less than a year of ownership.  I don't use it very often, this is not from overuse or abuse.  I try to use it and it just beeps at me and gives me an error message.",0
"This is THE BEST lip balm I've ever used, and I've used a ton of them. I just ordered 5 more so I can have them in my handbag and nightstand and desk...",1
The amount of the product isn't worth the price.  I could do better in a retail store.,0
"I've only used this for a week thus far and I think this is super effective. If you haven't used such a high percentage before, I would use every two to three days at first, then work your way up. I'm currently using this every other day currently. It does tingle/itch a little but I'm pretty sure that's the Glycolic acid working on your skin. I'll edit when I've used this for several weeks.",1
"This worked, but left my fine, thin, straight hair a coarser texture. The price is good, but I prefer the Philip Kingsley Pure Silver for the softness it imparts.",0
"My skin tone is medium dark and I'm of Asian descent. I bought this palette because I wanted an alternative to the naked palette. I'm so glad I did because the colors are so rich and pigmented. They blend amazingly well and feel so soft and silky. I used this palette for my New Years look, my Christmas look and I even use it on everyday occasions like school and work. It's so versatile and easily a must have for me when I travel. Highly recommend.",1
Nothing happened after 7 weeks.,0
It's okay.  My hair is still frizzy and dry looking.  I would have preferred larger barrels because me hair looks like Little Orphan Annie.  Sigh.....,0
This conditioner and shampoo made my hair full out,0
Good for travel. It is a mini for sure. Somewhat hard to hold and you have to do small sections of hair due to size.,1
"The scent is far from my favorite, but it works really well",1
This product is great for all kinds of colored body spots that need concealing whether it be on your face or other body parts.,1
I do like the curling iron but I could not get it to work in Europe using a converter to 110volt current.  I had no way to test it prior to my trip.  Will keep looking for another product.,0
"It's a jelly formula which means it takes 6 coats or so to be opaque. I'm super disappointed!!!! I was so excited only to be extremely let down. Awful formula, do not buy. Even over white it just looked ugly and messy.",0
Curls don't last more than 2 hours,0
"My hair is super frizzy and no amount of styling or straightening ever helped. I was so frustrated when I came across this. I added it to my cart but was skeptical for weeks. Afterall I had tried so many products and nothing had ever helped. But this has changed my life. Not only does it not dry my hair, it conquers my frizz and the style remains intact for days!! I absolutely love it. Best purchase ever!",0
"This is the best concealer I have ever used.
Does not crease or cake and at 54 years old thats important.
I will never use anything else.",1
Difficult to obtain even medium coverage when I used this product. Did not stay on more than a few hours.,0
Dries my hair out.  Normally I love Rusk products but my first can of this will be my last.  I normally use Indie Hairs foam#big volume but I like to stick to a hair product line and use primarily Rusk products.  I was happy to see that Rusk came out with a stronger hold mousse than the Thikr but this is awful.  The pump is also a pain to operate.  You really have to push on it. I wouldn't be surprised if it breaks before I empty it and frankly that's why I quit using Label. M products.,0
"When I first received this product, I was thrilled with the styling ease it provided. About a month later,  the plastic brush began to lose its teeth. Now I own something useless that I paid over $100 for. I can't believe that this company is still in business.",0
Fake do not buy fake fake fake fake fake,0
These are the best curling irons ever!!!  The cords are nice and long and THEY DO NOT Tangle - they actually turn with you - Highly Recommend!!,1
Super colour pay off with lots of moisture. Star of EM makeup line,1
"Wife says she can't tell the difference in the regular and acne brushes, but they are easy to change and she likes this one.",1
"This formula is the ""golden rule"" for outbreaks!! Just follow the instructions and you will be satisfied!",1
Leaves my hair so soft!,1
"put this acid on your face he said. It will even out your face he said. So before using this product, my face had patches of awesomeness mixed in with simply average zones. After a week of use the awesome areas were much more noticeable and in just a week-and-a-half my face had turned full blown awesome. I use the product once a day ~5x a week. Stuff works great; use it and have an awesome face.",1
"I don't normally leave bad reviews, but this product fails me on multiple levels. For one thing, I think it smells like bug spray. It has a definite resin-y scent the reminds me exactly of OFF bug spray. And then there is some kind of floral scent like petunias trying to cover it up, which has no business being in a product for men. But all that aside, it also gave me a rash the first time I used it. Whatever cade oil is, my skin hates it. To be fair, I have sensitive skin, but I've never had a problem with high quality lotions. This may work for some people, but not me.",0
I love this moisturizer and it doesn't cause any breakouts! I have combination skin and it moisturizes the dry parts but does not make the oily parts too oily. Highly recommend I have been using this for years now!,1
The spring in iron broke after using it a handful of times. Unable to return due to Amazon policy. Unbelievably disappointing - especially for a Professional tool.,0
I don't like,0

"On a whim, I originally purchased this pen from Sephora.  I am in generally good health and fortunate not to actually need heavy makeup on a daily basis to feel comfortable about my looks.  At most on an average day I use my spf 15 facial moisturizer and for work an acne reducing concealer for occasional adult breakouts.  I've noticed that my eyes get puffy and irritated in more recent years, most likely due to allergy (I do get adequate sleep on my days off).  I originally bought this pen when I had a sampler of ""All about eyes"" from Estee Lauder and some Biore eye gel.

The pen seemed highly ineffective to me.  I saw maybe a slight reduction in puffiness when I used it, very rarely this cooling relief for my sore eyes.  I had more results with the Biore eye gel which was immediate relief and reduced puffiness, and the estee lauder which improved the moisture around my eyes than this pen.  I know many women who took less better care of their health are desperate for a product that works, but I would skip this one and save yourself $20.",0
"I did not love this make-up brush cleaner. First, the process of using this stuff to clean your brushes is a long one. I just don't have the time for that. Second, the smell wasn't pleasant. Third, the spray nozzle isn't great. I now buy a brand from CVS and LOVE it. I wouldnt purchase this one again.",0
"My dermatologist was quite ""blunt"" when she said START USING SUNBLOCK on your face (after experiencing several basel cells removals).  It was difficult finding a ""face only sunscreen"".  I read various reviews on Amazon of other's prior purchases and decided to give this a try.

The sunscreen fluid is milk-white but goes on smoothly (I mix it with my moisturizer).  I have not broken out with pimples and appear to be handling this product well.

I would recommend this product to protect your face!",1
Great product - too expensive.  I'm trying new products to find one that is more reasonable toward my pocketbook,1
I just don't like it :(,0
A sweet light-weight hard worker.,1
Good product,1
Could not expect more from this product.  It has a long lasting hold and shine with minimal weight.  This should appeal to most men.,1
NOT THE REAL THING - DO NOT BUY - NO SENT AND CAN NOT BE RETRNED,0
My favorite color was discontinued.  I was happy to find it here.  I received it right away and I guess I need two more words before I can submit!,1
I just received this today and after I sprayed it twice the bottle separated from the spray top and all the oil spilled onto my floor. The top does NOT stay on!!!!!,0
good,1
Where I am a blond it helps with the tangles,1
"This product did not do much for my hair and the build up from my hard water, it smells great though.",0
The scent is wonderful! I like many others ordered this after receiving a sample through my ipsy subscription. However for $80+ you'd think they would have better package design. When I opened my package the set was bundled in a cheap silver bag. The silver coating actually rubbed off and stained the lotion bottle. And when I opened the perfume box I discovered that it had leaked out and the bottle was almost completely empty.,0
"I love this perfume, thank you, product was in good condition",1
"This product is terrible in terms of coverage and manufacturing of the tube/wand. The opening of the tube broke on the third use, so the whole wand pulls out without having the piece in place that wipes some of it off to evenly distribute the product on the brush. Before the wand broke, the mascara itself provided minimal lash coverage - you would need five minutes worth of constantly coating to get anything to even show up.",0
"The eyeshadow will make lines after just a few hours, runs too easily",0
"...like, really badly. But it made my hair very heavy and greasy. I couldn't wash this out. I tried using it for a month with the shampoo, but it looked like I hadn't showered for months after using this product. I tried everything to make it work. Oh well. I did like the smell, though.",0
lasts 15 mins only,0
My husband doesn't like it at all.  It looks like he put stuff right on his scalp. It doesn't seem to blend well and just doesn't look right.,0
Great product. Exactly as described.,1
I like the product but I hate the dispenser applicator...hate it! Takes a long time and it's either too little or too much and the color fades super quick,0
"Nice curling iron for the price. My hair doesn't like to hold a curl, so I have to use a smaller barrel to achieve a wave than most. This one does the trick for me.",1
I gave the shampoo to my mom and I kept the conditioner,1
Daughter loved these for Christmas,1
Far less results than anticipated!,0
"I have used this shampoo and conditioner for years. I will say I have always been extremely happy with it until I ordered through this vendor, BEAUTY IT IS. I noticed right away a few things: 1) the consistency of the shampoo and conditioner both were runny, 2) the smell; it had a chemical fragrance that was not normal for this product, 3) my scalp; red, itchy and irritated. This product is amazing, until you order through someone that has altered it to put money in their own pocket. DO NOT ORDER THROUGH THIS VENDOR!!!!!",0
"Great product.  I was looking for a cruelty free conditioner that's works and feels great and this is it! Smells great too!!  Doesn't leave hair feeling oily, just soft. My hair stylist recommended it and I'm so happy I tried it!  Worth every penny!",1
"Soothing, hydrating, smells good.",1
"I like their old lipsticks better, but I like the brand so I've stuck with them.  By playing around with lip liners and mixing shades I achieve the color I want, but I've always had to do that with all brands of lipsticks.  I just had to do it less with the old Jane Iredale  formulation.  But I like that their natural and they go on easily,",1
"Light scent, doesn't make my hair too sticky.  Dries clear (no white residue) and adds volume I didn't know I could have.",1
"So far so good...

I've recently learned a bit more about my skin type, and that it's main source of ""problematic tendencies"" is that it's dehydrated. So I produce a lot of oil, but can have dry patches?? It's been throwing me off for about a year now. A friend told me she had the same issue, and recommended Murad - after researching, I saw so many reviews in preference of La Roche-Posay.

It seems to be doing exactly what I hoped it would. I use it first thing in the morning, and see no slick, no sheen - which is usually what moisturizer does with my skin. It sits. This seems to absorb pretty quickly and smooths my skin. No dry patches underneath my make up!",1
If you don't have sensitive skin this product may be great for you....but my skin is very sensitive and using the product gave my skin blemishes.,0
"I have thick frizz-prone 2C type hair, and I have a lot of it. I've been using this styling tool for about 2 months now and honestly cannot imagine going back to the days of a separate blow dryer and brush. For one, I'm just not that ambidextrous and, for two, my hair is really thick and it takes a long time to dry.

This is a great tool with a minimal learning curve involved for how to operate the buttons and which direction the brush should be spinning while you're looking in the mirror. Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it! And it your hair gets tangled, don't panic, just press the reverse button!

The only thing I wish was different about this product: MORE SIZES, PLEASE! 1-1/2"" and 1"" would be AMAZING!

The best piece of advice to make styling much faster and yield better results: Dry your hair with a normal blow dryer until it's 90% dry (no brush needed if you have my hair type or lower) and then switch over to this styling tool. Don't think of this as your sole drying tool; it's your styling tool, not your blow dryer.

Most professional stylists know that you need to remove the majority of the moisture from the hair before it will start to bend to your will (at least with my hair type). This method is healthier for the hair too because it dries faster. Less heat = less damage.

ENJOY!",1
"Really disappointed in this blow dryer for as expensive as it is, it is cheaply made. I have bought this TWICE within the past few months. I had the older model which lasted me over 2 years of use (about 3x a week). I bought the new one and from ONE slip off the counter it smashed the plastic fan on the inside and started smoking. Dead. Ok my bad, must've hit just right on the floor? Nope, I recently bought a second one and it again slipped off the counter onto my rug and BAM plastic fan broken, loud grumbling noises, fan broken and plastic pieces inside burning and smoking. I mustve accidentily dropped my older one many many times and this never happened before. VERY disappointed.",0
Best temporary root touch up I have found!,1
Been using it for months have not seen any difference,0
"Wrong item, they sent me regular  argan oil !!!!
Only 2 sample hair shield 450 :)) it is funny!!!!
Disappointed , i am going to return it!",0
Great product!,1
this smells terrible. I returned it.,0
Would purchase again. Product as described.,1
Noticed no difference!,0
Great Stuff,1
Very bad smell and did nothing to my face!,0
Like .Nail is good,1
Good,1
"My daughter really likes this product, but it is rather expensive.",1
Best mousse I have ever used and happy to see I could get it on Amazon. Helps with holding the style but not too heavy.,1
Duped again by a product claiming full coverage but only delivering half coverage. My quest continues for a product that delivers as advertised.,0
"Let me start by saying that the current description for this product is wrong. ""The speed dr) brush is open vented which helps channel the air from the blow dryer while the curved shape hugs the scalp getting closer to the root allowing for the removal of excess water: speeding drying time by up to 30 percent.""  Um, no. It's not a blow dryer and you use it like a flat iron on DRY hair.

With that out of the way, I like it! I have long, extremely thick curly hair that I like to wear straight on occasion.  I blow dry it as straight as I can, then have to use a flat iron to get it smooth and silky. Only problem is, it also makes my hair very flat. A good look on many women, but not on me. With this brush, I can get my hair straight but also maintain some volume. It's easy to pull it through a section of hair just using one hand. As a bonus, you can use this device to make easy flips or curls at the end of your hair!

In summary, if you want super-straight, sleek hair, buy a traditional flat iron. But if you're looking for straight hair with volume, then I recommend this product.",1
Ok stuff. I don't like the smell.,0
I have been using this style of iron for years. I have tried other styles of iron but none can measure up to this. It is the best.,1
"Have used this product for 2 years now.  I like the feels, smell  and moisture it provides for my neck. Does it really tighten up the neck?  Well I would say it smooths the neck skin a bit, reduces about 20% of fine lines on the neck.",1
"I purchased this because I read that it's a great fragrance for those with a sensitive nose. Boy what a mistake. This perfume smells like a cross between bug spray and citrus. It didn't give me a headache as most stinky perfumes do and the smell dissipated quickly, which is a plus since it smelled so awful.",0
"I'm new to the Zoya line and as much as I like the line, the colors look very little like what I thought I'd be ordering.  My second dilemma... the skin tone visualizer....  I love that Zoya offers this tool, but it was hard to figure out my skin color shading.  As a result, I ordered colors for a different skin tone and once the nail color was applied, it looked different than the ""See It On"" feature.  I found a local retailer for Zoya, so I'll go into their shop to purchase vs. online.
My two-star rating is because I purchased 6 colors online, but only 2 of them look right on me.  :(",0
"This shampoo smells good, but that's about the only positive thing I have to say about it. It stripped my hair of its natural oils and made my wavy hair look fluffy and fuzzy. I LOVE Davines Melu conditioner, but I am not a fan of this shampoo.",0
My aesthetician uses image products and I wanted to extend the results of my facials so I'm using Image products at home on a daily basis. The serum is lightweight and smells very uplifting.,1
I didn't like the consistency. To heavy,0
Worked very good. Im pleased with this purchase.,1
"Not sure if this works or not, there isn't a dropper in the package to apply the product with.",0
"Really like how the product works, but can't bear the cheap perfume smell. Too bad!  Why do product developers assume we want to smell anything other than the perfume we CHOOSE????",0
"Just okay.  The spray itself was fine, and the smell is good, but WAY too strong.  I don't typically wear perfume, but I don't mind a light, pleasant smell from lotions or soaps.  This smelled like a doused an entire bottle of strong perfume on my head before I left the house.  At least I liked the smell, so I didn't have to shower immediately, but I couldn't use this except as my emergency stash - the smell is just too strong.",0
"This one barely did the job for me and it wasn't like I wore it to the gym or heavy work in the sun. I just wore it before going to work, and by the end of the day it was failing me. It is a bit surprising that I didn't like this deodorant because I really like this roll-on deodorant by the same manufacturer;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Occitane-L-OCCITAN-Roll-On-Deodorant-for-Men/dp/B00C3PB8LU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L'Occitane L'OCCITAN Roll-On Deodorant for Men</a>&nbsp;.

This is a product I won't be purchasing again.",0
The perfect gift!,1
Gentle and good for sensitive skin.,1
Product doesn't go on well. I find the LORAC Pro without Fibers gives a better length and fullness.,0
"One of the reviews I read recommended this product for fine thin hair. It does not work as well as the other very expensive product I had been using from a salon. When I wash my hair in the morning and then apply this product it seems to work fine, but by mid-day my hair looks stringy.",0
My skin always felt soft and smooth after using these and it helped clear up some acne.,1
Not anything like Pernox as they advertised. Way too oily. Made my skin more oily.,0
Just avoid meaningful beauty.,0
It does what it says it will do and it makes my hair look a lot thicker and makes it easier to style.  I add it after my hairspray so that my hairspray doesn't get it wet.,1
"I have extremely hard water in my area and my hair looked HORRIBLE, my roots looked extremely greasy and flat, my blonde highlights in my hair turned an orange coppery color, and my hair was hard, dry, and look very damaged. I used the treatment packet and the shampoo for the first time tonight, but not the conditioner (i used my own to help with the smell because it isn't too pleasant which is its only downside). I was happy with the results, my hair looks and feels softer, looks less orange, my roots look clean, and my hair feels so light and airy instead of weighed down. For the price i'm happy and plan on continuing to alternate the product with my regular shampoo.",1
"I don't know what all the fuss is about.  This product is very drying of the delicate eye area and it actually hurts my eyes - not good!  Also it's not very effective in removing eye makeup, especially long-wear/waterproof mascara - which is supposed to be its selling point.

Bobbi Brown's Instant Long Wear Makeup Remover is better, and even plain old Pond's Cold Cream does a better job and both are much gentler - no pain!  Sorry I've used it otherwise I'd return for a refund.  Spend your money on something else.",0
awesome product!!!! will not buy any other face scrub besides this one......kinda pricy but well worth every dollar.....highly recommended!!!cleared my skin of blemishes after first week of using daily...,1
"Love it! At last, a moisturizer that works well, is only lightly scented and isn't heavy. Goes on easily, blends into my skin and works all day.",1
Love it!,1
The scent smells off-not like freeza.,0
"I love the product, but if you buy this size, you will not be able to use the whole bottle before it liquefies into a watery mess.  This has happened twice to me, so it is a manufacturer problem.  I have written the company but they have not responded.  About halfway into the bottle, the cleanser breaks down from a liquid soap consistency to water.  It is very hard to get this ""water"" on your face, so you waste a lot of product and can't really tell how clean your face is.",0
Wife hates it and says leaves her hair frizzy.  Cheap Conair one she threw away worked better.,0
Does seem as to last as long  As department store,0
"I've ordered this product several times. This particular one that I received is ""water resistant"" and not ""waterproof"". I know there is a difference and I've seen both - the picture and description when I ordered said ""waterproof"". Either I received the incorrect item or it was mis-advertised.",0
Didn't see any difference with this product - it's tougher on my gums than what I had been using,0
"It doesn't smell like the CK one I have seen and used in the past, it was more of a powdery smell than this, its stronger than I remember",1
"If you have fine hair and would like more volume this shampoo is absolutely worth the price. I use almost everyday and after the first two weeks started to notice a tremendous difference in the fullness of my hair. I generally use the shampoo 6 days a week, taking a day off to use a harsher shampoo which gets rid of any product build up.",1
Half way thru the first bottle of 2 that i bought the shampoo appeared to be grayish and slimy- def not going to use the rest of this bottle.  I buy this product all the time and have always liked it. I'm actually going to call Paul Mitchell and report this to them also.,0
Smells like Palmolive clear...nothing special at all.,0
"Great blow dryer, real light weight, easy to handle",1
"Doesnt hold as well as expected. Makes my scalp itch after 1 hour of applying and throughout the day. But, the scent is decent (hence the 2 star rating)..overall not happy about it and it sits in the drawer as an emergency back up when I run out of the other product I use.",0
I'm not sure that this was a legitimate product. It seems watered down. I won't buy this on line again.,0
Its too sad that the i ordered this product on june 2017 and its expiried :),0
"I have sensitive skin. I like to use a balm after shaving. When I use this, my neck gets really red. Could be just me. YMMV.",0
"DO NOT BUY !! Complete rip-off. I have been using the (orange color packing) Anthony Facial Moisturizer SPF 15/30 for about 6 years now. They stopped manufacturing it recently and I had ordered this new formula All purpose moisturizer (grey color). I am not sure if I got a bad piece/batch or if this is how the new formula is going to be from now on but it is COMPLETELY watered down. Also, there is no scent whatsoever. An absolute waste of $30. See the attached picture for the watered down cream i received.",0
"Unfortunately I immediately returned this. The 2 metal plates don't lay flat against each other, making the item useless. Plus, the handle got extremely hot & was burning my hand. I should have listened to another reviewer who said these irons are probably refurbished & then resold. I have a friend who loves hers and that's why I bought it. This was a disappointing purchase.",0
Great purchase.,1
Do not think this is a Paul Mitchell product. Not happy with this item.,0
This product did nothing to brighten my complexion!!,0
"My favorite, go-to hair gel.  I have short, pixie style hair and love this gel!  Love the texture it gives without any extra weight.",1
Clearly says black on the description says black on can but when sprayed on my black hair it is brownish red. Black hair brethren do not waist your money,0
"So I ordered two of this toothbrush as they were smaller and easier to travel with than our previous ultrasonic OralB. Unfortunately one of them has just broken with regular use in a short peroid of time. Dissapointing.
Maybe the vendor would do the right thing and contact me for a replacement but unsure if the item is actually sturdy enogh.",0
"Dont waste money on the brand,buy a cheaper kind and still get the same results. I thought this brand would be thicker and more hair like,but this is powdery like the rest.",0
"I first used this with loose powder foundation, and it was ok-- but the distribution could have been better. Pressed powder usually came out cakey so I decided to try this with liquid. BINGO! Application in tight, small circles with my liquid foundation gave absolutely wonderful coverage- easy to apply, it was even, and builds well.

The bristles are densely packed but VERY soft. I've had luck washing it with Tea Tree cleanser from Trader Joe's, I've had no falling bristles or change in how the brush performs.",1
I LOVE this hair drier.  I was so tired of the noise of my previous one and how long it would take to dry my hair.  This one is fabulous!  Mrs. Chris Richard,1
"This product, for lack of a better term...stinks!  Literally.  I used the hand cream and nothing else because the smell was so bad.  It moisterized no better than an over-the-counter lotion or cream.  Very disappointing as much of the Dead Sea products from other vendors are fabulous!",0
Product leaked all over packaging and had a very odd odor. Do NOT think it is genuine Paul Mitchell.,0
"I did not find much use for this.  I give it 4 stars only because Xfusion is so good, I cannot bring myself to put down anything with is name.  Maybe there is a learning curve.  It just didn't cover in the back, and the front it was unpredictable and made a mess.  Had to wash it off.
I find I am better off using the Xfusion by itself in the back.  Much faster, covers perfect.  In the front hair line, it is really tricky, I find Fill in powder with a brush also sold on Amazon, and put it on really lightly far away from hair line.  I may learn to control that sprayer some day.  I will keep it, for sure.",1
nice,1
"Does it curl my hair? Yes.
Does it do it quickly and easily? Absolutely not.
I have used far superior curling irons at a lower price point in the past. (Ex. Infiniti Pro by Conair)
The Hot Tools curling iron has little to no smoothing effect on the hair.
I find it very difficult to use as the spring is very tough when trying to curl large sections and not strong enough to hold smaller sections/ends of hair.
The heat setting dial is very sensitive and very easy to accidentally move when curling causing inconsistent temperatures.
Overall, I would not recommend this curling iron.",0
Color was horrible and plastic was defective when I turned to get color out they all broke so I couldn't use them.,0
Seems to have an odor.  Not what I wanted.,0
i had high hopes for this product as i have tried so many things to help get rid of my baby's cradle cap. this product didn't work for her just made her head more dry.,0
Does not get as hot as expected. It's average not as good as my old Golden Hot curlers. Decent purchase.,0
"Many years ago I vacationed at the Sanibel Harbor Resort and Spa in Florida and they had a wonderful mango shampoo (called ""Mango Mist"".  They stopped using that shampoo and I can't order it anymore, so I've been experimenting with all sorts of alternative mango shampoos.  This Klorane mango shampoo is the closest in fragrance to the ""Mango Mist"" shampoo. I really enjoy it.  It's made to order aromatherapy for me :-)",1
"Fantastic for colored hair!  Make my hair smooth, frizz-free, and heat/sun protected.",1
"I'm not sure if this is authentic.  I've had this shampoo before that I purchased through a Paul Mitchell hair salon and loved it. This bottle, however, makes my hair very greasy. I even gave it to my mom to try, who has very dry hair, and it also made her hair greasy.  It does smell the same, from what I can tell, but it makes my hair a greasy mess.",0
The product is grassy in the skin. There is not peeling in my skin but I feel sensitive and redness. Not recommended for all skin types.,0
I cannot say enough good things about this dryer.  My hair is SHINY after blowing it out when usually it ends up a frizzy texture that I need to run a flat iron thru.  Amazing!  My husband even noticed my hair looked softer than normal.  Very satisfied!,1
"After two months of applying the serum every night, I see no additional hair growth to my thinning hair problem.",0
This product is alright but just not exactly what I was looking for.  Just my opinion.,0
"I really wanted to rate it 3.5 stars.

This bar is great, it's smell is absolutely wonderful. It's scent isn't easy to describe, but it's definitely ""spiced"" and ""masculine"". The scent lingers, subtly, it's very well balanced. The scrubbing texture is also superb. I'm loving it.

It loses all it's value though in how quickly it disintegrates. Once a day, regular use, 13 days and the bar already became thin enough to break in half. The halves I have left will last me another 5 or 6 days.

As I said, it's a fantastic soap. I absolutely love it. However, with how short lived it is, in conjunction with the higher price, it's not my regular soap. I'll keep shopping, this will be relegated to ""every once in a while"" treat.",1
"I wash my beard every two days with this wash and it dries it out every time. However, the scent is nice and it is easy to lather and rinse.",0
Product cake damaged. Will be returning.,0
"Put the product on once a day just on the lashes and made my lower eyelids red and swollen. Tried 5 years ago and did not read the directions and put the product on the base of my lashes and they became red and swollen. Wish I could return, but I missed the April 18th deadline.",0
Smells greats last 30 mins. Knock off,0
I have been using this product for years.  9 to be exact.  It usually last for around 9 plus months.  It is expensive so I use it sparing.  I bought this Feb. 2 and it is March 15 and it is gone.  It is only me that uses this product.  I'm not sure if this came from Amazon or another vendor.  I'm just going to look for a new product. Not happy,0
It was good but one of the shadows broke,0
I received a sample size of this handcream in a Christmas gift. I had to order a bigger size. I use it so much and have noticed a wonderful difference in my skin. The product has a lovely (yet slight) scent and is not greasy or messy. I have noticed that my skin feels more flexible and young looking. I will continue to purchase this product and encourage friends and family to buy it. I am buying more for Mother's Day gifts!,1
Love the color! Doesn't wear as well as some other brands.,1
"I purchased this fragrance due to price.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I sprayed on Legend and it was forgotten in one hour or less.  I cannot detect any smell on me or my clothing.  What is foul is that you cannot return it. Warning,  Be careful!!!!!",0
Silky soft on skin and blends right in.,1
"Better prices available, wasn't a great deal.",0
pretty color,1
Thick brush makes for imprecise application. Might have worked for me with a finer brush.,0
"Smell is a little overbearing at first, but then it wears off quickly. Goes on great. Does not have the water proofing as I would like. It does hydrate and leaves hands, arms, etc. soft.",1
"I have fine straight hair that I sometimes curl with a curling iron. However these rollers save so much time. They warm up in about five minutes and are ready to go. For body you can leave them in just two minutes or make your hair bouncy and curly in five minutes.

The clips hold the rollers securely so you can move around without fear of them falling out. There are twelve rollers but I find I only need eight.

This set is best for shoulder length to long hair. It creates spiral curls which is nice if you don't want to get a perm.

I also found the cord was long enough. So if you are looking for a set of hot rollers that heats up fast and either gives you body or curl this is a good option.

You can also see if the curlers are ready by looking at the dots on each roller. They turn white when ready on high.

~The Rebecca Review

I received one free set of curlers for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion.",1
This is a good bland and great product for prevent skin damage! I used every day before make up. Great!,1
"I've been very pleased with this shaving cream.
It really helps cut down on the irritation from shaving with a safety razor around the neck.
For the price it's definitely worth a try if you are on the fence about it.",1
"This stuff smells amazing! It helps prep my wet hair for detangling, and gives air dried hair some extra texture. Not sure how well the heat protection is because my hair still feels crispy.",1
"The shadows are very pretty, good buildable pigmentation, and last a decent bit (almost all day under Urban Decay Primer Potion without retouching for me, although I have very oily lids).

I got it because I was tired of parabens and other toxic garbage in my cosmetics, which I now know (thanks to good documentaries) are very under-regulated in the US and associated in good scientific research with many health problems, including cancer.

I am not sure that this is 100% non-toxic, but the ingredient list (according to the EWG skin deep guide) is much better than most brands, and it actually irritates my eyes a lot less than almost every other brand.

The compact is of good quality, a good size, and (to be more environmentally friendly), you can buy just refills.",1
"I have purchased other palettes on Amazon, they were also from The Balm, and they came in perfect shape. This palette was just horrible. I opened it today and it was all dirty and shattered with broken glass. I am very disappointed to have received it in this shape, I probably can't even use it. This is my first negative experience with the company and is making me question future purchases.",0
"I owned this dryer in black/purple for many years until it started blowing cold off and on.  I loved that it was light weight and had a diffuser and worked for both my naturally curly hair or blowing it out a bit.  I bought it again and it came in this red, even though that wasn't what I ordered (or left my original review on) so I was already a little annoyed about that.  After about 2 months, however, the dryer started making a really loud noise--as if something metal was loose and moving around--and it was blowing really hot and I literally threw the box out the day before so I can't even return it.  I just stopped using it as I'm afraid it will catch fire.  I think this brand has gone downhill as another reviewer had the same complaint and I'm rather bummed as I can't find another lightweight dryer with a diffuser aside from the drugstore types.",0
"Bought it when I was drunk in a bar and a very kind hairdresser suggested it for my very oily hair. This shampoo is so expensive that im hesitant to use it... but when I do, my hair feels the best it ever has. Smells good, feels good, gets the oils out and doesnt over hydrate the hair.",1
"Great to blend setting powder with foundation, leaves it nice and dewy! I got some in my mouth, let's just say -dont.",1
Doesn't show any results of a tan. Just a smell,0
"I did not want to be one of the many reviewers who complained their hair became greasy and overly full of residue, but sadly I am. I like PM shampoo but this one is lousy.  I wash my hair every other day and on the second day my hair usually is a bit oily but tolerable, after using this shampoo it was really dirty looking on the second day. I had to re-wash and it's still gross. So I would stick to their Shampoo One Or Shampoo Two. The Color Protect shampoo is a total dud, but I can see how they feel the residue might soften colored treated hair but it just doesn't work for me.",0
Classic fragrance!  All time favorite!,1
Loved the iron at first but the purple coating flaked off after about 4 months.,0
"We've been trying to cut out as many chemicals in our products used at home, so we decided to try this. It smells nice, the consistency was odd, but rubbed in well and didn't seem to leave much greasy residue. We were in the sun at the beach for a few hours, reapplied every hour or directly after being in the water and my husband and I are both completely burnt. I will not be using this product again and am extremely disappointed that I bought two tubes.",0
Does not work I have not not notice any difference at all.,0
The shampoo left my scalp oily. I don't think it was legitimate Paul Mitchell. Beware buying top shelf hair products outside of a salon.,0
This product calms the frizz and makes my hair shine.,1
This mousse left my hair super hard and stringy. I have bought cheaper mousse and had better results.,0
good product,1
Smells wonderful. Not sure it is effective.,0
I first saw this product in a YouTube video on another girl with thin edges. It worked well for her so I decided to give it a try. My hair is very fine and I've had thin edges since birth so wearing my hair up is very difficult. This product really works! It really helps to disguise my thin areas and allows for multiple ways to style my hair. The only downside is that it's great for THIN areas not completely BALD areas. The fibers only adhere well to hair not skin. It also will come off on your hands or clothes if you're not careful. Also...GET THE APPLICATOR!!!! It is way more efficient in hitting the right areas,1
"While it looks like a full sized eye pencil, it's not. It's not a pencil, it can't be sharpened- but it's also not adjustable either. As far as I can figure, the little tiny nub on the end is all you get, and if that becomes dull, you'll either have to use a brush, or you're SOL.
Seems to crease a lot. It's gel, so I surely didn't expect smudge proof, but I'm just not at all impressed.",0
"First off my hair is very blonde highlighted it's thin but I have a lot of it and it's alittle past my bra strap I'm growing it out alittle - I have used Lanza Healing oil conditioner, joico aveda ect. All top brands but I stumbled across this in an upscale salon store and figured I would give it a shot I cringed at the price but after only 2 uses I'm hooked this stuff is amazing! I plan on buying the travel set for my up coming vacation trip! I gave 4 stars due to price I think this could be a 40$ item however my hair feels like I just left the salon and it smells amazing! I can't wait to see the long term effects of this product if your hair is colored you will love this! I don't even have to use any products on my hair except unite 7seconds and medium hold Moroccan oil finishing spray and my blow outs are great! I'm not loving Oribe's hair sprays, oils or creams they weigh down my hair but I will continue to buy this Edit: a few weeks of using this and the shampoo my hair has ever looked better it's healthy bouncy and over all looks great! Finally a shampoo and conditoner that work as promised definitely a fountain of youth product",1
"Returned this for the white, now out of production, BaByLiss. This one made my hair frizzy because it took too long to dry.",0
"I was expecting this polish to stay on for at least a week with no chips especially for how much it costs.  I gave it two stars because I love the color, but I've tried it twice now and it chipped the first or second day both times.  Disappointing.",0
"Probably a great product for cradle cap (which is what it is advertised for), but unlike some of the other Mustela products this one has a strong perfume fragrance. I found it overwhelming and only used the product once.",0
"Currently my favorite mascara. I love long, natural looking lashes and this mascara definitely does the job!",1
"I have been using the large tube of Strivectin-SD for a month.  It cost $135 less 20%.  I think it is worth every penny.  I have used it twice a day and there is a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin - smoother and fine lines are diminished.  It is not a replacement for Botox, which works much better on diminishing frown lines and crow's feet. I do both.

This is a good moisturizer but it really does much more than any moisturizer I have ever seen.",1
Good,1
This curler gets HOT and gets hot fast.  I can't seem to get my hair to style quite right with this style curler but that's not its fault.  It does what it says it will and the curl seems to last.,1
Works well,1
I am a big fan of Elemis products and this is one I will continue to use.,1
"Really works, when applied correctly. Great product for those with a lil insecurity, purchased the smallest as a test and I foresee future purchases.",1
"My wife used this during her pregnancy because it was recommended to her by a friend.  It is pricey but works extremely well!  No stretch marks!  If you are worried about getting stretch marks, I would highly recommend this product.",1
This product arrived with a large dent in the metal bottle.  I find it did not live up to its advertisement and would like to return it.,0
"Smells great, my very picky brother loved this product.  Bought the set as a great christmas present for the hard to buy for guy",1
Contains propylene glycol not the best of ingredients due to severe effects it can have on eyes over long term,0
I was expecting to see results with this product after reading all the hype.. Very disappointed. Waste of money indeed.,0
"I am extremely disappointed. Trusting Amazon quality, Instead of buying it locally, I ordered one on amazon. First charge was 12 hrs. I used it twice. 2nd charge, used once and then noticed it turned on automatically and ran a cycle. Battery therefore was drained. 3rd charge for a whole day. It showed a full charge. Couldn't turn on. Tonight was the second consecutive night that I had a jel covered face and no NuFace. so frustrated. I don't recall ever purchasing a defect from amazon. And I've used amazon Germany, US and China. One time I'm doing something a little more daring and this happens. $180 for 3 uses. Device is brought to shanghai. Return window missed. I don't know what to do...",0
Best shampoo for curly hair I have tried. Mild and smells great. Worth the price and more.,1
good item intersted to buy again,1
"In original unopened packaging, when I use up my other bottle I will open this one up.",1
AWESOME product to detangle my 3 years old's hair.,1
"The texture of the file works well for filing nails and mine seem less prone to splitting with the crystal files. I keep this in my bedroom, safely placed on the nightstand. For my purse, I prefer a Nail Tek file, which comes with a case. The Opi file has held up after almost 3 years.",1
Bought this instead of my usually (Anthony deodorant). It goes on white and chalky and smells like a cheap antiperspirant from the 90s. The scent is the worst. Reminds me of the high school locker room from my youth,0
"This eyeliner does not stay as promisse
I put on the morning before work
When I get to work is all off",0
The label said black honey but the product was not the same as I have previously purchased.  The color was different and the fragrance was lemony.  What happened?,0
It's ok.  Stays on long but not as easy to apply as I thought it would be.  Needs a lot to cover gray.  But it does work and looks natural.,1
Works ok. Not as good as some other products I have used - but it could be my curl type because my daughter has used and it works well for her.,1
I ordered for this color (brown) but received a red instead,0
Best smell,1
"Doesn't work, don't waste your money.",0
"This is a great face cleanser and makeup remover though I would suggest using something specifically made for eye makeup if you use any water proof formulas or a lot of product.  I love Vichy products and this cleanser does a really great job on the rest of my face, but I find that I need to scrub at my eyes to get them clean with this product - which is exactly what you shouldn't do - especially ladies of a certain age.  There is a lot here to love.  It's make of high quality fresh and natural materials by a company that is committed to providing high level experiences.  Not a single Vichy product I have used has ever caused a negative reaction or irritation on my sensitive skin and this product actually serves to sooth and cool my skin.  Very nice.",1
The bottle wasn't full.... for how much this stuff is it should be full to the top!!!,0
Hands down my favorite Wen product! I cannot live without my sweet almond mint styling creme! Needs to be packaged differently when shipped though. I didn't like the fact that my bottle had already been assembled and product had leaked out during shipping. I don't want my holy grail product wasting before I've received it. Was expecting it to be sealed like when it's originally purchased through Chaz Dean.,1
I was disappointed as I thought it was a  shellack color I could use with the light and it obviously did not work that way. It was displayed with the other shellack polish,0
"This can be used separately according to the sale verbage.  However, I find that a gentle drag from top to bottom give a nice bloom to the cheeks.",1
It really does reduce the signs of fine wrinkles.,1
"Husband is on his second bottle. I'm not sure if it made his hair any thicker, per se, but he liked the scent and the bottle lasted a long time without becoming funky smelling. Great price.",1
"Essenza di Roma is a very heavy scent. It reminds me to a great extent of the Eternity perfume. Both of these are what my coworker calls elevator chokers - meaning, if you have someone wearing this first thing in the morning and they get on a crowded elevator, the scent engulfs and overpowers everyone around them.

I sprayed a short spritz on my wrist and neck, let it dry and then put on a turtleneck, which, when I smelled it the next day, it still smelled as strong as it did the day before.
Frankly one of my favorite scents is almond based which this one says, it has ""Layers of vanilla and almond'. I could discern no trace of that, instead it is a musky fragrance - nice for people who like that, but I certainly hope no one sits beside me in a theater or restaurant wearing this - it's just too strong.",0
Not exactly like the original but it works. I have not found  another product like it.,1
Very happy with this cleanser. I've read so many great reviews about this product on various sites. It has an excellent scent as well. Would definitely recommend this cleanser to anyone.,1
"I like wearing neutral color on my nails and I usually love Essie.  I went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  I was disappointed with the product.  It goes on with lots of streaks.  It needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  I stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  I doubt that I would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but I will experiment.  It is a good color for the office, but I still wish that it was less ""watery"".",0
I love the smell and so did my girlfriend.  She can't keep her hands off!,1
This is my favorite hairspray by far but it arrived with a defective sprayer.  Hairspray shoots straight up and out the sides getting sticky spray all over.  I didn't have a way to return or replace once I finally opened it to use because it had bee a month.  Could not fix and cannot use.,0
The product was not properly sealed. I purchase this product a lot. The last two times the opening was not sealed like it normally is on the inside. The lid was partially twisted and the contents were spilled in the box. Basically got half the product two times in a row.,0
It's didn't do what is supposed to do.,0
Great and at least half the cost of what I paid for the same product at the salon. I will reorder this product.,1
"I have been using this product for quite a while, very satisfied. It's too bad it can't make me beautiful, just my skin :)",1
Easy to use.,1
"I use lip balm religiously and picked up a couple tubes of Jack Black at Sephora about a week back, Blackberry Black Tea for myself and Grapefruit Ginger for my dad. Blackberry Black Tea has a mild and pleasant berry scent. Though it's my favorite hands down of the five, it also does have a vaguely medicine-like scent that might not be another's cup of tea. Grapefruit Ginger smells nicely refreshing but is on the fainter side. Dad mentioned the grapefruit scent was too weak and the ginger scent was nonexistent, though the remaining smell would be really good if it was just a little stronger. Mom and I agree he's got a hypersensitive sense of smell, so ""weak"" means something coming from him. Lemon Camomile smells sweet and fruity, not like lemon dish soap, and had the strongest scent of the five tubes. The stronger scent wasn't overwhelming for me, and I quite liked it. Natural Mint with Shea Butter smelled nicely and strongly of mint. However, instead of Shea Butter with Vitamin E were tubes of Vanilla Lavender, which smelled nicely of both vanilla and lavender. For myself, blackberry smelled the nicest, followed by lemon camomile, grapefruit, natural mint, and vanilla lavender. Though I can't say anything about the others, Blackberry Black Tea and Grapefruit Ginger don't taste like anything.
I'm embarrassingly picky about my lip balm and have gone through a million brands. Jack Black might be my new favorite. I'm quite pleased by how long the balm lasts. With both Burt's Bees Mango Butter and Nivea Kiss of Olive Oil and Lemon, my favorites before finding JB, I had to reapply at least every couple hours. With JB, I only need to reapply after eating. Its longevity is probably an attribute of its thickness. Others have mentioned it's slightly thinner than Vaseline, and that's the best way to describe the product. It goes on smoothly, and there's a nice texture that's just a little more viscous than cherry Carmex also from a tube. It's also definitely balmy, rather than either runny or waxy. The thickness of the balm also protects very well, probably because the balm doesn't slide off like other lip balms sometimes do. My lips have definitely remained soft since I began using it, and I haven't had any flakiness or dryness yet.
Jack Black Blackberry Black Tea, as compared to Burt's Bees Mango Butter, Maybelline Baby Lips Quenched, and EOS Honeydew:
Scent: 4 (fantastic, but a little faint), 5 (fantastic), 4 (nice, but not outstanding), 3 (smelled waxy)
Longevity: 5 (reapply 2-3 times a day), 4 (reapply once every couple hours), 2 (reapply once an hour), 2 (short lived)
Moisturizing Quality: 5 (soft lips all the time), 4 (soft lips with use, but a little flaking if I forget), 3 (feels soft with use, dryness when not), 1 (filmy feel, no moisturizing qualities)
Overall: 5, 4, 3, 2
It's a rudimentary comparison.
Aside from that, the packaging looks really nice. I appreciate the look. It also seems pretty sturdy, and I've been carrying it in my pocket daily. SPF isn't a major thing for me, but I appreciate that it's there. I am slightly miffed by the fact the tube wasn't completely filled since it is on the expensive side. But the quality makes up for it. I'll definitely be purchasing again.",1
"I ordered two of these and while they work well, they smell awful. Sort of a rancid smell. Perhaps I got old product, because I can't understand why anyone would buy it if it's supposed to smell like that. I used to use Paul Mitchell which smelled GREAT.",0
This was a fake. I've been using forever and this has no smell and seems like water to me.,0
"I have bought 3 different products (Issa, Luna2, and Espada). For the first time, I submitted a warranty claim for the Issa because it only hold a charge for less than a month and does not last for 6 months. I submitted the claim since March 1. It is so frustrating that the customer service sense of urgency is LACKING!

Clarsonic and SonicCare has a EXCELLENT warranty and customer service. The day I contacted them about my issues, a replacement along with a return label was mailed the next day and received it in 2 days Priority Mail.

Foreo, still has my Warranty claim ON HOLD SINCE March 1. A customer service finally responded and told me to mail my toothbrush back to them. Fine, but she did not give me an RA# nor an address to send it to. Plus she said ""There is no guarantee that they will honor it."" WOW! Well bye bye FOREO! Im back to Clarsonic and SonicCare.",0
"I took a gamble ordering this after reading all the reviews stating that its not authentic. I thought no way Amazon would be selling an inauthentic product. I was wrong. I own this product from my ipsy bag and Ive been using this brand of eyeliner for years. I ordered this to keep one in my purse and one at home, since I already have one. This product is nothing like the product Ive been using forever. Its watery, runny, has poor pigmentation  barely worth $5, much less $20. In these pictures you can clearly see the difference between the authentic Stay All Day, which is on the top, and this product. I was so shocked because the packaging itself looks real so I examined it super closely to look for differences. Its barely noticeable, but the font on this product is much thicker than the font on the authentic product. Im beyond disappointed in this purchase and I won't be making the mistake of buying brand name beauty products from amazon again. Overall, don't waste your money. This isn't real. Just go order it from Sephora.",0
The picture online of the product is not the same as I received.,0
"Felt the need to review after reading several negative reviews about this product. This product actually works very well!! It doesn't smudge, it's water-resistant and sweat-resistant. My legs have never looked more flawless! The key though is to shave, exfoliate, and cover your legs well with moisturizer to avoid having the cakey look. I played with the colors in stores first before buying it, so I didn't have a bad experience with ordering the wrong shade.

The only reason why I didn't give this product the full 5 stars is that the only way to quickly fully remove the this product through using the Dermablend makeup remover, otherwise it's a bit of a hassle to remove.",1
"Not easy to refill. Doesn't do a good job. Just get a cheap drugstore makeup brush instead. Dip that in acetone, and you got a less expensive and better nail touch up tool.",0
"This product stays on!
I love the red color! I hadn't had any trouble with feathering or bleeding.",1
"This product is amazing. I use it on my hair and skin. The microfine mist is perfect for your hair, leaving it soft and shiny. The smell for me is a real plus. I also use it on my skin, it eliminates any dryness and I have noticed a marked difference on the 'experience lines' also known as wrinkles.",1
love the darker version but all these products are great!,1
"It does not have the same quality as the sample you receive in the luxury box. Also, the product was not sealed. Very unprofessional!!!! This product can not survive in the market with this business strategy. It is too expensive, not the same quality as the sample product and they don't even seal the top.",0
I was not overly impressed with this product.  It is quite expensive and comes in a VERY small container.  It did nothing for my hair but make it look dirty.,0
"When I open it, It's full of alcohol smell. I don't like it make my skin pricking, but I still stick to have used it for one week. I was disappointed and gave up because it totally  doesn't work for me!",0
didnt really notice much difference,0
Did not care for this shampoo...,0
Granddaughter was very happy with perfume!,1
I was disappointed with this product. I love all Chi products but for some reason this just wasn't curling my hair as well as other products have. I am returning it.,0
"Love this cleanser, sqeaky clean and you use just a pencil eraser head amount so it will last a long time.  I subtracted one star only because it does leave your face a little dry.",1
"Not quite as dark as I'd hoped, but still works great.  I use it every day.  I love that it can be moved easily as needed.",1
ok,1
Not what i expected.,0
"I bought four bottles. Three of the pumps were broken. Not that big of a deal, I know, but when pay so much for ahampoo and conditioner the pumps should work.",0
I thought it would grow faster I am in my six weeks now and it grew just a little and no thickness,0
"When I saw that label I was skeptical. I don't really get how this can be soap and oil and the same time, but somehow it is - and it makes your skin feel awesome.",1
"This polish is the best! Love it, love it, love it. For the manicure to last a week or more the secret is to use their base coat as well. I like deep dark colors best but they tend to show wear more quickly than light colors do but CND dark colors last. I sometimes put another coat of topcoat on midweek to ensure a weeks wear. I've always done my own nails I was happy about that especially after I worked in a doctors' office and saw too many cases of nail fungus most likely caught in a nail salon. I'm about to turn 67 and have been a bit obsessed with my fingernails since I was six years old and found I had strong nails that grew very long so I've been trying different polishes ever since, this is the best to date.",1
"I would not call this luminizing, it was almost a liquid highlighter.  It was pretty, and felt like a nice formula, but way to shimmery to wear all over my face.",0
"My husband loves everything we have tried from the Jack Black line. Lots of really great products. I like to use it too! I wish it was a little more affordable. As much as we love it, he would honestly probably croak if he knew what I paid for some of these items.",1
This is a great sunscreen. Goes on nicely.,1
Cleans wonderfully,1
"Tan towels must have been old stock, didn't darken like they should have.",0
I'll wait till it goes on Sale at Paul Mitchell Next time.  But it's good stuff.,1
AMAZING! !!! LOVE it soo much. Great highlighter for warm/olive skin tone! !!,1
"I am the wife of the person listed (we all use his account in our family). This product is great for damaged, frizzy hair. Doesn't eliminate frizz, but helps. Definitely takes out tangles. I have been using it for years.",1
"This is a fresh smelling, clean rinsing, nice and foaming face wash. My skin felt clean, but not tight or dry. It didn't feel like it had a residue either. I paired it with the matching vichy purete thermale toner and it left my skin completely clean of make up.
It didn't irritate my eye area, and removed my eye makeup without difficulty.
This is a very nice staple cleanser.",1
"An amazing scent that I have enjoyed for years.  But it did not seem to last the ""50 hours"" as described.",1
I started using this product when they sold it at sephora and it totally made help my eye lashes. My lashes grew a little long and a lot fuller. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a little help with their eye lashes.,1
"The jar did not damage,but kind of messy inside! I don't know it it because the shipping process caused or the item already been opened. Dispointed. Otherwise,I like this brand's mask,it usually good quality.",0
"PLEASE be very careful if you buy this product.
My face and eyes swelled to a huge size- my eyes swelled shut.
I have had to see a dermatologist for treatment as my skin is still not cleared up from the horrific rash this product caused.
When I read the details of the product it was exactly what I was looking for.
Of course, you might not have the extreme, negative reaction to this product that I have had, but I caution all buyers to try a TINY amount on the side of the face, not where it will be in plain sight.",0
This does wonders for your hair. It helps to create volume. I started using this after my hair stylist used it on my hair for an event. A must if your hair is flat and you need to add volume.,1
Great product but the shipping was awful--I won't do it again. The top was 1) boken; the stuff was 2) spilled; and it was missing 3) the pump.,0
Very light,0
"I was so excited when I got this yesterday, and I immediately plugged it in to try it out. I had the dial set at about 350ish. As soon as my hair touched it, it MELTED. Not singed. My hair literally melted to the iron. I changed the heat setting and the same thing happened. So I unplugged it, letting it cool down and then tried it again in half an hour or so. This time it didn't heat up at all. Wtf. So disappointed. I haven't decided yet if I'll try it again or get something completely different, I obviously got a faulty product.",0
Had less product than others I've bought. Haven't had it a full month yet and need to reorder,0
"I love this product. It maintains a moderate hold while still allowing you to run your (or someone else's) hands through your hair. At 1.7 ounces, it is a little on the smaller/more expensive side compared to similar products, but I think the cost is worth its benefits. It gives you a slightly-shinier-than-matte finish and doesn't make your hair look greasy. Its smell is mild--I don't really notice it--and it easily washes out with water and shampoo.

I have bought Rulebreaker couple times on amazon (because it's about half the price of the same product in store), would definitely recommend! 4 stars because it could be a couple dollars cheaper--but I'm not complaining too much.",1
"Not the usual OPI Nail Lacquer. Usually I buy this because it doesnt chip. But for some reason, the past few times I bought this polish, it is A LOT thinner than normal. It chips in less than a day. But the color is rich. And spreads nicely in a single coat.",0
"It's fake. When I received it I was reading the directions and on the back it said something like ""only guaranteed if sold from beauty salon or store. Other products may be fake"". So I tried it out and it made my hair feel like straw. Paul Mitchell products should not make your hair feel like that. If you're looking for a good leave in conditioner I suggest you buy it from somewhere else",0
Not worth the money. Doesn't do anything more than .99$ nail polish,0
"I love all my Art of Shaving products, I've been using them for years and never been disappointed.  The newer  Ocean Kelp variety is very refreshing and perfect for everyday use.  I highly recommend.",1
"it was not sealed, how in the world can you possibly rely on humans to be honest when it comes to profit?? very unhappy with this product and the shampoo, made my already dry hair knotty & more like straw than Suave!!! Awful. cant  be the real product!!! shame on you FB for not doing your due diligence!",0
I have very dry skin (due to a medical condition). Most of the shower gels make my skin itchy and even drier or require me to moisturise soon afterwards. Not with this bliss shower gel. I am so glad I found it. My skin is so soft after the shower without residue. I even use it on my face. No film left. The smell of vanilla is not super sweet like candy or cake. Very grown up. Strong enough to be smelled but not overly sweet and annoying like those bath and body works. I almost smell like licorice in the notes. Very unique. I am impressed.,1
"I have been a many-years user of the Clear/Invisible version of this and have loved it.  I have hyperoily skin (PCOS) which is also very sensitive to products.  I tried the tinted, curious as to whether it would (a) even out my blotched rosacea complexion and (b) wear as well as the invisible version.  No and no.  The tinted version felt really greasy going on and melted off my face within the hour.  The tint was unattractive for my light complexion.  So I deep-sixed the bottle.  Now it looks like the invisible version isn't available anymore?  How can that be?",0
"I bought this because my dermatologist had recommended it to me for these bumps I got on my belly, legs, and arms due to pregnancy.  They first thought it was pups but it wasn't going away.  I bought this and it stopped the itch and healed them up well.  The only thing is I wish it was more concentrated so you don't have to use as much!!  I would definitely buy again!",1
"Product works well and delivery was speedy!  I did have a pimple or two after use, but a small price to pay for a dry face!",1
Its gel that's all it us just gel don't waste your time and money,0
"OK IF YOU HATE SHAVING?!?! Get this , then go to YouTube look up how to use shaving soap. Watch several videos. Then break out your soap/cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try! If you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet.

I hated shaving! My skin always got irritated and burned after! Then I tried this stuff after watching hours of videos, I broke down and gave it a whack. Now mind you I'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and I get worn out in my chair quickly!!!! After using this I look forward to shaving I can't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause I'm going to shave... I will spend the extra 10 min to get outta  bed to go through the procedure to shave ! My skin comes out so smooth and irritation free!!!!!! And the girlfriend really noticed a difference! Spend the money, spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting !!!",1
Legit! Looks good and real! Shipping took two days. Not bad.,1
This is a review of the packaging which was awful. Just recieved and this conditioner was spilled all over the place. Severly disappointed.,0
Good,1
Not worth the money at all,0
Just like putting scotch tape on your face. It didn't stay on and having to cut the patches into shapes was a real pain.,0
"Even with light coverage, this moisturizer Makes skin look smooth and matte. I would buy again.",1
I have only had this for 7 months and the cord pulled away from the end of the straightener and will not stay in place. It worked great up until this point. If there had been extra pull on it I could understand a little better but this was not the case here.,0
Doesn't work very well!,0
Didn't work that great.,0
I have skimpy lashes to say the least and this product is the bomb in making them look longer and thicker. LUV IT,1
Pureology shampoo & conditioner is like no other product I've tried for color treated hair.  Both the color and highlights stay as vibrant as they were when I walked out of the salon.  The price seems high but it also goes a long way.  Well worth the money!,1
Needs strong acetone to fully remove. Almost clear,1
"I ordered the wrong styling gel, it was suppose to be Ouidad vita curl tress effects styling gel .",0
"This hair spray has a very strong smell. Even with two small sprays, the smell lasted for hours. It smells like a strong perfume a grandmother would wear that would overpower everyone.
I really did not detect a tobacco smell.
The hold is not as good as my wifes regular pump hairspray either.",0
This hairspray does not hold up in the humidity.,0
"I upgraded from a Con -Air curling iron from 2008, so the first time I used this wand I was all like:
Okay so my hair keeps slipping of the end of the wand. I hate this thing. IT'S HOT. Why is the cord so long?  Oh. My looks fabulous. I LOVE THIS THING.
For real, though, it took a little getting used to. I wish the barrel was longer - my hair is fine, falls past my shoulders, and I kept having to reward the section of hair until I got a feel for how to hold the wand. (Hint, holding upside down worked for me, but I'm kind of known for doing things backwards). The heat setting goes past 400, but I set it to 380 and it works really well. I don't want to singe my hair, and I've read that too high of heat will turn your hair into frizz, kind of like those 90s trolls we grew up with. After using this wand three times now, I'll say what I like most is that my hair actually holds a curl. I thought it was my hair, but it seems the issue was that crappy curling iron I subjected my hair to for so many years. I would totally buy this again. 4 starts because I wish the Bartel was longer (maybe they make one. I don't care enough to go look because then I'll just be pissed I didn't see it before ordering this one). I'd include a photo but I'm Selfie challenged. Oh hell, maybe y'all could use a confidence booster (Damn, I thought MY selfies were bad. Check out THIS chick). Ignore the frizz. It's humid today. But you can see the back as well. I curled my hair in 2 layers.",1
"I was excited to try this new product but came away very disappointed.
The smell -is like a bad cheap perfume. Also a synthetic smell that is nothing like a natural lavender oil. If you love the original 8 hour lotion, then stick with it!  This is no upgrade. If you want to lighten up your original because its so sticky and doesn't spread so well then mix it with an oil free, fragrance free lotion and then apply!",0
"I work in skin care and this is by far a superior product. All my clients purchase this because it applies like a primer and super sheer while still having zinc and titanium.  Not just a sunscreen, but a great anti aging moisturizer.",1
It's a good shampoo but a but I can't use it daily because I need more of a moisturizing shampoo.  I live in Colorado and the high altitude causes dryness.,1
"Didn't seem to do anything for me.  The bottle is too small, not enough content to make a proper judgement as to effectiveness...",0
"Works great on my hair, not too heavy at all.",1
"Got this product just to try something new.  Smell was very faint but pleasant, so this product would be okay for guys. Product didn't seem to rinse out as well as I would have liked, but that may be due to the hard water where I live.  That said, my rating is due to the mild burning sensation that I got after using this product.  My head wasn't on fire, but the feeling I got was that I should not use this product any more.  I've used Tea Tree shampoos and this wasn't the same tingling you get from those.  Since switching to something else, the burning sensation has gone away.",0
"Very poor quality for hair dryer. The second time I used it, it broke down. I wouldn't recommend this product.",0
"First tried this at the Barber  shop, then decided to order it. Not sure why, but it does t seem to be the same. The he'll come out very runny, more like a liquid. It seems to take a lot of it to style my short hair. And it does not seem to hold all that well unless I use an ungodly amount.",0
"This ""powder"" cover the pink of your scalp and brings less attention to the sparse areas of hair.  I like it.",1
"Holds all day.  Even holds up through a soccer game.  The pump is the only way to go and it's in bulk.  Love it, love it.",1
Leaves a white residue on my skin. If i rub it in it flakes off.,0
"I ordered this by mistake.  I thought I had clicked on the Christian Dior and recognized the mistake when it arrived. I thought about returning but read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I must say I found pro's and cons.  I loved the color of the dark brown.  The negative was there seems to be very little product in the package and goes on very thin, but I am used
to the CD product which is fantastic.  I would recommend they cut down on the packaging (which is very nice) and use that money to add more product to the tube. I also do not like that you can not use a make up remover wipe to remove.",0
They completely changed the formula- it smells super synthetic and is not nearly as moisturizing as it used to be.,0
"I bought this foundation at my local Kohls. I typically in the past preferred matte foundations but my skin has been severely dry and I just wanted something that looks natural, maybe even a bit Dewey. I got this because it said ""natural performance"" and no where on the packaging did it say anything about it being matte but BOY was it matte. I can understand why people may like it but for me it's a no go. This stuff does not blend well on my skin at all whether I used a brush a sponge or my hands. Even if I use a thin layer it still looks dry and cakey yet it gets oily as the day goes on which is strange to me. I really wanted to like this product but it's just not good for me. I even saved it to try it again when my skin left this horrible dry phase it was in, and I still didn't like it. Still looked dry and it feels tight and doesn't blend. I feel like I'm putting glue on my face.",0
"Big mistake. It's not waterproof...nor it will stay all day. I work 12 hour shift... by the end of the shift....
I don't have eyebrows anymore.....  I have normal skin.",0
Terrible stuff. Thick sticky. Yuck,0
"There have been lots of things on the news about sunscreens lately and how most of the Amazon reviews concentrate on the smell, not effectiveness. Well, I have no way of knowing if this is really SPF 30, but I can see that it is not full-spectrum, which is considered important by those that know these things. It does smell fine - like sunscreen ;-). I will use it for times I may not normally use sunscreen - quick trips to the store, etc., but won't count on it for a day at the beach. It is only 4 ounces, which is is less than three of the recommended 1.5 ounce (shot glass) applications, so it will be gone soon.

This is definitely not worth the money.",0
Very pleased with product,1
"Love it's precise placement but was surprised that the bristles on my second purchase are so hard and scratchy this time.  Why, Japonesque?",1
I usually shave my head with this razor. And it's not good enough to do the job quickly & completely. I have to use another Gillette razor to make the finishes.,0
Not really a clarifying shampoo which the name made me think it was :(. I also didn't care for the scent. I oredered Rusk Clarity (or clarify-light purple color) and loved it!,0
This soap lathers up good.,1
"I've used this product before but purchased it from department store. It's supposed to be much more cream-like and slightly lighter in shade. Instead, it's really packed (maybe dried out, maybe too old), and that makes it hard to apply.",0
"Maybe it's because I'm so used to liquid foundation, but I found this to be very cakey. It didn't go on smooth at all. The makeup quickly settled into my pores and it was very easy to rub some off onto my shirt, hand, etc. As for coverage, blemishes were covered but the makeup kind of piled up around spots and made it obvious that I was covering something.",0
Product isn't reliable. Entire top comes off easily and hard to put back on.,0
"I have dry hands after having my baby and doing the washing and rinsing all the baby stuff (of course you can use washer, but not all the time). it is expensive but not working as well as even nivea......",0
It is one of the best fragances I ever experienced. I am afraid that when I need it again they don't have it. I w / also like to add that my grandaughters come to my house and they ask me where I get the Calvin Klein cream that smells so good.,1
used it before and still use it. Love it,1
Quite happy with the smell,1
"Smells terrible, would never buy it again.",0
Great conditioner I am very much satisfied with this product.,1
"This diffuser keeps sliding off the nozzle, I need to use tape or something to hold it down",0
Huge Bottle for such a cheap price!,1
excellent product and good presentation,1
loses 1 star because of price,1
"Everyone's hair is different, but this didn't work for my hair. It was worth a try.",0
"Ack!  I mistakenly bought this when I meant to buy the salt scrub.  This Bliss product contains plastic microbeads!  I thought the plastic microbeads were no longer being used, but I guess I was wrong.  Why do you even need them when salt or sugar scrubs work just as well?",0
I love this product and it lasts forever! I finally just had to purchase another bottle after 1 year of using it 3-4 times a week on long thick hair. My friend recommended this product to my for my dry hair and it has helped tremendously!,1
This is a great hydrating treatment!,1
"Smells awesome, however it doesn't work for me to shrink pores or set my makeup. I love the way it smells, but it doesn't do much for me other than that. I've been using it for a week, so as time goes on I will update if it gets better",0
"This lotion basically changes my life. I have all types of skin conditions, although mild, but dryness is definitely the worst, specially living in a cold place. This lotion has changed the texture of my skin. I even joke about how soft my elbows and knees are now because I cant believe it. I have super sensitive skin and can barely use anything on my face and this is the perfect moisturizer. I recommend it to anyone that is trying to combat winder skin or just trying to feel and look fab.",1
Good burnout great,1
"Terrible! Also, this product contains ammonia among other chemicals!!! You do not want to inhale, consume, or even have this stuff on your skin! BEWARE!",0
"I found out two things upon trying this the other day. First, it is very powerful. After two short squirts, two rooms in my apartment were bathed in the scent for a good hour. Secondly, upon smelling it, my 18 year old daughter said that it reminded her of my father, her grandfather. I felt the same way. It's heavy on the musk and very strong. Neither of those are my choice qualities in a men's fragrance.

Currently, I use Hugo Boss Energise and Karen Low Black. They are both clean and fresh smelling, which I prefer, plus a bit unique, which is also nice to not smell like everyone else. To each his own, and I relay my personal preferences as a point of comparison for your own.",0
My Babyliss only lasted 4 months before it stopped working.  Worse iron ever!,0
"I was so excited to have received this mascara after reading over all the great reviews. However, my experience was anything but exciting. I have used many brands of mascara in my lifetime, but none quite like this. The first day I applied the mascara it looked like I had put nothing on my lashes. The texture of the mascara was like water. Not sure if this is normal for this mascara or not. No thickness and no lengthening to my lashes whatsoever.....I waited a few minutes to apply a second coat. Still no difference. My blonde lashes looked ever so slightly darker. That's it. My lashes were still as short and sparse as ever. That night my eyes were a bit red but it had been a long day. Didn't think much about it. I thought I would use one more day and pick up a new brand the following day. Not like I had a lot of time to be looking for a new brand of mascara. Again. Especially after I thought I had done my research. Day two: my eyes began watering and twitching. I could not wait to remove this mascara! Went to bed. The following morning both eyes were red, while my right eye was red, swollen, and visibly irritated. Absolutely NOT the result I expected :(",0
Like but I think better ones are on the market - too pricey,1
good,1
"Great smell and feel. It is a lighter weight balm. Not certain how this would hold up during the colder weather, but for indoor use it is just fine. On the expensive side given those factors...",1
Purchased the item through amazon and had not used it for even 2 full weeks and the head of the toothbrush comes right off while brushing.  Emailed customer service and says its not suppose to do that possible defective product.  Customer service from amazon cannot replace item I have to return the item and repurchase another one.  Not to happy with the fact I will be out of a toothbrush and not happy with the quality for the price.  Unsure if i even want to repurchase after this return.,0
Who doesn't like this? It has been my go - to scent for a few years now. Great value on Amazon as far as price per ounce goes.,1
I love this hairspray! I have straight hair that is hard to hold and this hols my hair without feeling like I have tons of hairspray on.  Smells wonderful too!!!,1
"I was really excited about this project with all the positive reviews but unfortunately it didn't work out for me. I think it might have irritated my spots even more, the buffering lotion did nothing and and the drying lotion dried all my good skin out but not the spots so I had horribly flakey spotty skin.",0
"This stuff has CLEARLY been tampered with. Bottle had marks all on it, no seal except a dingy piece of tape on the lid. It appears the lotion has been watered down. Disgusting. I don't know what is in it. The smell is so faint unlike what this product should be. And it smells like a cheap vanilla from Wal-mart. It was also low on lotion as if someone used it for a month. $30 dollars? Worst money I have ever spent. I was so looking forward to this:( I feel cheated! Is this common on Amazon? If so, shame on me for not doing my homework.",0
i didn't realize this is tube was so small.  too expensive for this product.  need to find a different option.,0
New way to try something I didn't want to buy unless I knew I liked it,1
"This is counterfeit product! Do not buy! It is extremely watered down and nothing like the actual product you buy in a salon. It also has the telltale barcode sticker over the actual barcode, which indicates that it is counterfeit.",0
"A year ago I received samples and fell in love with the Mario Badscu line. I never liked toners because they dried out my skin, but this toner works amazing. The only thing I don't like is the strong odor.",1
It worked great-for a month-then just quit heating up,0
It's a personal preference of fragrance but it's better than you find in stores and it has a good lather. Only take a small amount so it should last quite a while,1
"gave it 2 stars only because Amazon has a great return policy

I have long layered hair and tried this about 5 times and each time it left me with shineless, frizzyish dry looking hair and the waves did not even last. Mine was from quick -e shop not sure if that matters but figured I'd mention.

I'm also comparing this to the results I get from the Infiniti YOU CURL Curling Wand by conair the XL one....which I LOVE! I just wanted larger curls/waves....oh well
Also, it Squeaks when you use it...odd",0
So great the colors are what I expected! Beautiful pallet & now my current favorite. If you are second guessing..DON'T! You will love it too,1
Works good if hair loss is minimal,1
I was disappointed. It was supposed to have conditioner in it. It is hard to apply.,0
"Not a fan for my curly hair. I'll stick with the hydrate going forward, this formula could use some work.",0
the rod broke while brushing my teeth !!! WTF is going on here? not even a month of use ...,0
Like the repair shampoo better.,1
"The tube is horrible. everytime i opened it, it would ooze out and it was messy. as for the product, i did not notice anything significant for my under eye area.",0
It looks horrible!  It's so patchy.  Using eyeshadow is 100 times better,0
"I have difficult skin; its sensitive and very dry after washing, but it gets really oily as the day goes on. Most sunscreens, even the sensitive skin formulas, break me out. This is one of the few that doesnt.
I like how smoothly it goes on, and the tint is light enough for my pale skin tone. Its not mask-like or orangey, even after several hours.
Only downside is that it tends to wear off (especially in my t-zone) after a few hours as my skin gets oilier. Still, its better than any other tinted sunscreen Ive found, and I regularly wear it instead of foundation.",1
"Great fresh color....natural looking. Lightly ""beach"" scented!",1
I've purchased several other hair products and imperial is by far the best! It's water based so it rinses out and it doesn't leave my hair oily.,1
Love this stuff,1
Irritated my skin and costs more than prescription retinol creams (which also irritate my skin but at least they're cheap).,0
"We had to return it because the first time we used it, the clip on the fin holding the ankle strap came lose and got lost in the ocean.  The clip needs to be permanently fasted to avoid this.  We did get our money back when we returned it.",0
"I bought this product before and loved it, but this tube of product is completely separated. Oil just leaks out when open the product and I have no idea is the product is effective is this clearly defective state. I'm really bummed that I don't have an option to return this item for a refund.",0
"Small enough to carry in my purse, and just as the larger size does not have an odor.",1
This shampoo is terrible. It makes my hair look like the crypt keeper. Color-safe search is still on. Back to Aveda in the meantime.,0
I have extremely sensitive skin and was unable to use this product. My face became irritated from it.,0
This is a great makeup.  My complexion is slightly red and this makeup covers the red without using a primer and then makeup.  Luv it.,1
Didn't see any change.  Only result very dry skin.  Wouldn't recommend,0
The worst nonsense ever. It's spray paint for your head that stains your hands face clothes or anything you or your hair touches.  5 hours later i touched my head and my fingers are black,0
"Was so looking forward to this item. It came quickly; unfortunately it arrived damaged . The blush must have gotten detached from the base and got stuck to the cover, completely unusable.",0
Sexy fragrance! I love it!,1
"Simply does not work, difficult to dispense. Threw it away.",0
Two words..get it. Fantastic highlighter and bronzer for contouring.,1
"This is what a razor is supposed to look like.  And this is how a shave is supposed to be.  It's not as hard or dangerous as you might think.  And you will get a nice, comfortable shave with a minimum of fuss.  All the attempts to get gunk out from between your multi-blade razor?  No more.  The expense of those space-aged blades?  Reduced by over half.  And when you shave, you will feel you have a substantial thing in your hands, one meant to last, with a simplicity and elegance that is hard to beat.  That makes it a great way to start your day.  So when you are ready to go back to the safety razor (or to try it, if you never have), this is the razor you want.",1
"I have thick, wavy, damaged hair and I tried this product to help fix it but it dried it out even more. Way too strong for my hair",0
In my opinion it is not what it says it is. Its like a thick base coat.,0
"This is fantastic if a pimple has already come to a head. It will speed up the pimple life-cycle extraordinarily over night. Its so much more hygienic than popping and as someone who is prone to scaring after pimple popping I appreciate that it takes care of a lot of my problem spots.
So, I tend to just apply these to white heads.

However, if its a deep pimple that hasn't surfaced/come to a head yet this really doesn't do anything other than dry out the skin--which if you want to use concealer or foundation over it will create a new obstacle for getting a smooth finish.",1
I love this.  It smells so good and it makes styling my hair so much easier!,1
the containers do not work properly  ..  you click the button and NOTHING comes out ... I've orderded this twice and it doesnt work right.  I am returning this product,0
"I have wavy hair that likes to do wacky things. This is the best product I've found that helps keep the waves without frizz and without getting crunchy. I also like that it smells nice, is made from non-toxic oils, and when you comb out your hair later (like the next day), there is no unsightly residue and then my hair is soft and wavy and still looks decent.",1
"Silky,smooth, yummy smell and great product! I love Korres anything. I will certainly buy this again as it is an exceptional product that delivers great shine!",1
"Something wrong with product, very watery",0
Just can't seem to get the hang of this -- and it always feels damp/wet/sticky,0
"great mascara, better than the original blinc.  You can layer this one on so lashes are thicker.  Will buy again!",1
Great razor for a beginner. Not aggressive but gives a great shave....haven't  cut myself  once.,1
"Nice big bottle, great price",1
"I used MEG 21 just after a laser resurfacing facial and it provided some  immediate calming.  There was a slight reducing of redness.  I like the way it goes on.  It is difficult to see exactly how much remains in the jar to know when to reorder before running out completely, though.",1
I really enjoy the nice clean fresh scent of this perfume. It is not an overpowering scent so it is great for everyday wear. I will knock a star off because it doesn't have the staying power of some perfumes. Overall a nice product particularly heading in to Spring and Summer when a lighter scent in the heat of the South may be desired.,1
I received this as a Christmas gift. While I did like it I went back to my Aveeno shaving cream which I felt did a slightly better job of keeping my skin less irritated after shaving. I would consider this again as it's ok but not for the price.,1
My condition started to spread to my shoulders and close to my elbows over the years. I have used the kit religiously for one month now and notice a difference in my skin.  The pimple-like bumps are starting to clear so I will definitely try the product longer.  Take the warning of sun-sensitivity seriously. I normally don't sunburn but I did during my trial.  Probably best to try during colder seasons.,1
"I found this product extremely difficult (and frustrating) to use.  The piece that grips the hair to too short and it takes way too much time to curl your hair.  I would  suggest making it the same size as other curling devises.

Funny thing is that I say a TV commercial where an entire head was curled in 5 minutes.  Not sure how they did it.

Just another thing in my bathroom that I cannot use.  I'm gonna sell it on eBay.
Too Bad....",0
Good as always.,1
Didn't like the smell of it,0
"I returned it. I don't get it, a toner suits my needs much better.",0
I bought this for a friend to use. He suffers with some discoloration and breakouts. It has worked wonders in smoothening out his skin,1
very happy,1
Best hair product I've ever purchased.,1
"I had very high hopes for this iron, but it sucks! I'm used to the clipless curling irons but I figured I'd give this one a try. It took me FOREVER to do my hair and the curl didn't hold AT ALL. By the time I was done the hair on the bottom was already almost straight. My hair holds curls really well so I don't understand. I will surely be returning it.",0
"Disappointed in the product as well as their customer service. I purchased this for my husband as a Christmas gift because I figured the Zwilling JA Hecknels brand would be superior and a nice stocking stuffer. While the product cuts well I agree with other reviewers stating that it's very hard to see while you're clipping a nail so accuracy is severely diminished. Furthermore, the center piece holding everything together broke within the first month or so. My husband tried to repair it by putting the piece back in but it just kept falling out. Because the time to return the product had expired I went directly to the manufacturers website and emailed them regarding the broken clipper. They took over a week to respond. They wanted me to ship the product to back to them at my cost, allow them to evaluate the product and then determine if the product failed due to user or product flaw. If they determined it was due to user they would charge me for the repair. Seriously ridiculous response!  This is not customer service! Very disappointed in their customer service as well as their warrantee. Considering the cost of this clipper I was very surprised. This experience has definitely diminished my perception of the quality of their products. I won't be purchasing anything from Zwilling JA Hecknels brand again when there so many other comparable products available.",0
The product I received was made in 2010. It has been expired for over 3 years already.,0
It's beautiful ,1
Very oily... not for face skin.,0
"I'm very happy with this after shave.  It's not over powering.  Be careful when ordering as the amount is US funds.  Therefore, you will see it's on par with other retailers.",1
it is creamy but does not last long when applied for coverup...,1
"I just love this product for men (haha), Oh boys skin is skin and I know men are not going to pay for something that doesn't deliver or pay for pretty packages that cost twice as much just to smell good. This product is for the practical so whether your a Georgee girl or guy or just have skin (doesn't everybody have skin?) Shhhhish it's a secret this stuff has all the high end ingrdients with vitamins, skin renewing AHA/BHA, and antioxidants that aid, protect, and make beautiful love to your skin while remaining free of dyes and smelly smells. 3.4oz(100mL)of a great deal in a practical no frills snap shut sqeeze tube.",1
I have been using it for about a month and didn't see any significant changes yet.,0
Love this product,1
"Bought Dodgy Barnett. It is decently pretty, although not quite as shimmery as the photos I had seen online. It also chipped within a day of having it on my nails, even with a top and base coat. Definitely wouldn't repurchase.",0
"I've been using this since the start of my pregnancy. The smell (kind of vanilla sweet) is much more subtle and tolerable than Mustela, and the product absorbs nicely into sensitive skin (unlike the more financially reasonable options like the oil by Noodle & Boo or Burt's Mama Bee Belly Butter, which both made me break out and didn't absorb well).
I'd say 4 bottles will get you through your pregnancy, if you want an estimate from someone who uses it every morning and about 1/2 the time in the evenings. No stretch marks on my belly yet. Wish I had used it more on hips and breasts, too, now.
I wish they had a lavender super-mildly scented option--would be great at night.",1
"This didn't work as well as I thought it would.  I cut myself a lot which almost never happens with the ""generic"" Barbasol shaving cream I normally use yet I still had hair in a few places that for some reason the razor didn't quite pick up.  It took much longer than necessary to apply the cream and I realized after 3 uses this just wasn't for me.  The cream residue also builds up in the sink and can clog the drain much easier than the regular shaving cream.",0
This stuff is amazing !,1
"Interesting to see the comment on bad packaging.  I am experiencing some ""dial up"" problems on this too.  No big deal. My complaint is that the product itself doesn't work for me.  Using it guarantees a problem later in the day.  Smells good until I use it.  Everyone's chemistry is different.",0
Met expectations,1
"If I could give negative stars I would - this seems like a very cheaply made item. Other than the very tips, the plates on this thing don't even meet. Also, the temperature dial feels very flimsy and loose. It's going back without even being used!!",0
I didn't notice a difference. The one from Batiste is the same exact thing. Don't waste your money.,0
Pricey not sure if it is working.,0
"Very good product, everyone should try it!",1
This bottle must have been old when it shipped.  I've used this product for well over a year and I have never had this experience.  Typically it foams up .. Hence foaming cleanser... This bottle does not and it doesn't even have the same fresh smell as bottles before,0
It can toggle itself off pretty easily - that's my only gripe about it.,1
The top won't stay on and the color vanishes very quickly. I will not purchase this item again.,0
"This product combines a complexion corrector and a sunscreen in one. It is light and non greasy, but it's also viscous as it is also meant to be a sunscreen. I am a little sensitive to ingredients in most sunscreens so I was happy that this one did not itch or burn my skin. It also smooths out my skin and acts as a primer over which I can apply a little moisturizer and powder foundation or a BB cream for an even glow without the redness.

Unless you have severe redness this is a good coverage product. My cheeks become fairly red in winter so I will be using it regularly. I wish it did not have the sunscreen as I cannot use it around my eyes as it makes them itch and water. So I have to use it on the redness prone areas of my face. It's fairly expensive, but it's worth it for the people who have extremely sensitive skin and cannot use anything else.",1
This straightening iron has to be the best one I've ever owned. The only issue I've had is the paint is chipping on the edge. So far it hasn't made any difference in how it straightens. It is light weight and makes my frizzy hair look great. I want to buy another for a back up and a couple for Christmas gifts. If you buy one I hope it works out great for you too!,1
everything was fine .. just wasn't sure if the product is real i went to macys to check  is the color of the perfum was the same as this bottle and it was ... i'm gonna keep it since it was a really good price although still skeptical of its authenticity,1
Yes this goes on thick.  Yes its very milky white and might make you a bit pasty looking especially if you are not pale as a ghost like me (this white was a pretty close match to the skin on my legs).  Yes it is very pricey.  But yes it also works like it should.  I bought it at the last minute for a trip to New Orleans where I would be spending hours upon hours out in the sun (one day was a 3 hour bike ride which almost entirely in the bright sunshine).  If you have polymorphous light eruption you don't mess around with UVA protection unless you happen to enjoy getting a full body rash akin to the chicken pox.  Good stuff but I do hope to find an equivalent at a cheaper price.,1
"Had high hopes for this product, but man did it let me down.  Put it in and it basically made my hair feel like straw.  It is WAY too dry too - couldn't get a decent style out of it no matter what I tried (dry hair, damp hair, dry hands, damp hands, etc).  Didn't use too much either so it can't be that.  Just didn't work well for me at all.",0
"I purchased this product after speaking with a sales rep at Silk'n who claimed this product would remove the hair on my beard.  I'm a guy with a very heavy beard, and I hate it, and I also have shaving. So decided to give this a try.

This product is not a laser hair removal device, instead it uses a high energy flash of light (kinda like an old fashion flash bulb) to try and singe the hair off your skin.  Unfortunately it doesn't have enough energy to singe the hair on my face. About all it did was singe a little bit of the hair off the end of the strand of the hair, but it would not burn it clean down below the skin.

I followed the directions by thoroughly shaving and then washing my face immediately before use. I put the device up to it higest power setting, and proceed to flash my face in a grid like pattern as directed. The product generated enough heat to lightly burn the skin on my face, it was somewhat painful, however for the most part the burn was not severe enough to leave a mark. There was one spot on the curve of my chin which protrudes out a little, and the Flash & Go did burn off a layer of my skin which took about 3 days to heal. Unfortunately after finishing the treatment with the Flash&Go I could still see the end of the hair flush with my face where I had shaved it off with a razor.  The hair grew back the next day. The manufacturer claimed after a treatment it would have 1 to 2 weeks for the hair to grow back. This was not the case. I tried 3 treatments on my face with this product, and the results were all the same as I have just described.

I also decided to try the product on the hair growing out of the top side of my fingers.  I had to flash each spot about 6 times to burn the hair down, but I could not get it to burn off the last 1/32 inch of hair. It left some short stubble that would not burn off. The hair proceeded to continue to grow the next day.

I returned the product to Amazon.com, and was given a full refund. Amazon was also gracious enough to pay the return shipping. If you want my advice, don't waste your time purchasing this product, and save Amazon.com the shipping charges.",0
"This is a small bottle - but it does last for a very long time since you don't need very much.  This is the 2nd bottle I've purchased.  The creme bouquet smell is very mild and doesn't last - not overwhelming at all. I think it's a milder smell than the jade blossom version.  It works well to take the oil out of your hair as well as any smells, but it does dull the shine a bit since it is a powder.

As I've been experimenting with many...many dry shampoos - I have finally found a mix to go 3 days without shampooing my very, very oily hair.  The first day without washing I actually use&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Victoria-Secret-So-Sexy-Style-Clean-and-Go-Dry-Shampoo/dp/B005D1Y2YG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Victoria Secret So Sexy Style Clean and Go Dry Shampoo</a>&nbsp;- this gives my hair insane body and wipes any traces of oil away.  It does leave your hair with a layer of what feels like hairspray.  So the next day my long hair actually looks like it did the day before - I just brush it out and add this powder to soften it up.  I don't even need to flat iron again.  I never thought I'd ever be able to go a day, must less 3 without shampooing before!  Love it!",1
"The Blagger color is slightly misleading. It appears the color in the picture when wet, however, when dry is it a litter darker. Slightly disappointed.",1
"Getting burned even with this product.  The SPF does not seem to work.  We checked the expiration date and it has another year left, so that is not the problem.
Only 6% zinc oxide.  Better not leave the house if this is what you are using for sunscreen.",0
"This smells really good, like real bananas. Wish you got more of it.",1
great deal.,1
"I wanted to use this to cover some dark acne marks.  First of all, its texture is too oily/greasy, so it basically slides off the skin, forget trying to put any other type of makeup over it, and it rubs off no matter what you do to try to set it in.  Second, the coverage is very minimal and sheer, even if  you try to build on it (which you can't because it's too oily), so the dark spots shine through and are even more pronounced.  I took this back to Macy's and traded it in for the Dermablend cover cream, which I absolutely LOVE.",0
This is a great product that was recommended by my Dr. I only wish it came in a larger tub.,1
I absolutely love this curling iron. It create the perfect loose curls that are nice and soft. Will definitely buy from this brand again!,1
"Doesn't work as well as the Got2b texture powder that I can no longer find anywhere.  I thought this product would be better because of the brand, but I don't like it.",0
"Amazing! I've had three similar products from other companies and this one is the best. It can be washed with fabric softener, unlike other types, which is much more convenient. Its larger than other types so you have to wash it less often. It's super soft so it's gentle on the skin but still takes off everything, including mascara. Wash it before first use or it will repel water like crazy.",1
"I love this product and have used it for a long time (ordering from Sephora). However, decided to try ordering here for a little savings. This product was either watered down or plain not authentic. Not the same wonderful serum I have come to love. It took a few days to get a response and a refund too (even after it was confirmed delivered back to the seller). Never once received an explanation or apology. Not happy with my experience here with this particular product. Be careful.",0
"Fake products from this seller! I've used Pureology loyalty for 15+ yrs & purchased from salons, Amazon, eBay, etc. I purchased a set of 33oz hydrate shampoo & conditioner & this hydrate spray in conditioner 'color fanatic', all from this seller despite a few questionable reviews when i ordered in December. HUGE mistake! This seller is selling fake products. Bottles & labels look almost identical except for a slightly different shade on the bottles although not noticeable enough to really throw me off initially. Now that I've opened the bottles, they all have a different texture, consistency, smell & feel than authentic Pureology. I've purchased Pureology products many times for years on Amazon (from other sellers) & this was the first time I've been ripped off with fake Pureology products. Be extra cautious because upon further research & calling Amazon today to file a formal complaint, this seller is selling under multiple accounts & listings. Amazon will be investigating this seller & hopefully protecting buyers from further dishonesty from this seller. I wish i would've taken the advice of the negative reviews in December on this seller.",0
I tried this at a spa in Mexico and wanted it right away. They were out of stock so I was happy to find it on Amazon and at a better price!  I love that it rubs in so well and does not feel oily.  It moisturizes great and makes my skin silky smooth all day.  It is also great for your cuticles.  My only complaint is the smell is a bit strong.  It would be great either unscented or just a very light scent.,1
"Been using for years, good stuff.",1
Did not care for it.  It smudges to much under the eye,0
"I can't compare this to anything except canned shaving cream/gel.  But after using it for well over a month, it meets my expectations.  I would expect this to last at least six months, based on shaving 3-4 times a week. It has a clean smell, and I can say from experience that the lid makes it travel friendly.",1
Very slowly,0
"Love all of Rene Furterer shampoos and this one is no different. Fast shipping too, product arrived on time.",1
"The color is nice and natural, makes it looks like you don't have lipstick on
The moisturizer part is okay, not as good as Vaseline or other more famous moisturizer lip-balm brands but it does its job anyway, it does keep my lips moist.
The only thing I feel uncomfy with is that I gotta use my fingers to apply, which makes me have to go wash my hands before putting it on.
Anyway, it's worth buying and is a nice tinted moisturizer for your lips :)",1
It was not creamy at all. I expected it to be thicker instead it was watery. The smell isn't like the perfume. It's a little different.,0
it break. i can't use it,0
"The product works great, but the photo is misleading. You get a little more than half of the container. Bit of a ripoff.",0
"Used it a couple of times, its a conditioner but I still have flyaways, uuggggg....",1
Wow! This was so much better than my monthly subscription boxes! This was packed full with fantastic samples. I am so excited to try many new brands and products. I can't wait for the next beauty box!,1
The color is nothing like the picture!  It is a lot brighter in person and would be great for Halloween but that's about it!,0
I rub in just a little dab on each cheek and neck daily for dry skin and to smooth wrinkles. It is not oily and there is no film - it soaks in. My dermatologist approved it. Expensive product but worth it and the Amazon price is the lowest I could find!,1
"My perspective is from one who uses a razor and brush -- a classic, old-school shave.  So, I was interested to see how the Ahava might mix up my shaving regimen and give me an even closer, more comfortable, and faster shave.

It's a good product.  It's a smooth cream and as its name clearly states, it does not foam or become thick.  After soaking my face in rather warm water and softening my stubble with a hot washcloth for about 30 secs., I apply about 1 pea-sized dollop of Ahava to my wet skin and coat it evenly.  A little seems to go a long way.  The feeling is slick rather than thick and I was able to get a good, close shave using a fresh Astra double-edged blade.  I did get a small nick and the Ahava didn't sting or feel the least bit uncomfortable.  It rinses fairly easily and my skin feels clean.

Pros:  Doesn't clog my razor; applies smoothly and evenly; only a small amount needed for a full shave; has a nice, masculine scent; convenient squeeze tube

Cons: The scent is overly strong for me; more expensive than a typical cake of shaving soap such as Proraso; getting the exfoliating effect of a shaving brush requires using more product; may not provide enough protection from a slightly duller blade so it may require changing blades more often

I like this Ahava Time to Energize shaving cream.  Whether the special ingredients such as Dead Sea minerals actually improve its performance is unknown to me (and I suspect this is just marketing) but it performs well.  I'm not certain the extra expense is worth it, as I rather like my current product lineup but I have no problem recommending Ahava to someone who needs a convenient shaving cream that performs well.",1
"I have sensitive skin and get acne spots sometimes, like maybe around a 1-2 small pimples in a week or so. Still, that bothered me a lot! I heard about this product and decided to give it a try but i wouldn't recommend this to anyone!!! The first time when I used it, the pimples seemed to dry out by the next day but in like day or two I started to notice dark spots on the spots I used this masque. and it was really uncomfortable and itchy and it looked burned for almost around a week. even layers of makeup didn't cover it. Eventually the more I used my exfoliator, the skin started to peel off from those spots but still even after that it was really dry and needed extra attention and extra moisturizer like around 3  times a day! so yeah after that experience, I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin.",0
"I would consider myself a product junkie... always trying new things to tame and control my extremely course, dry curls. Well, this product does the job! I am shocked!!  NEVER in my life has my hair been so soft, and my curls so perfect!

I used the Curly Girl method of washing and drying with a microfiber towel with the ""Plopping"" method.  Before ""plopping,"" I generously added this leave-in conditioner to my hair, then added ONLY ONE handful of mousse (i typically have to use at least two handfuls).  After taking the towel off my head and giving a slight shake, the most perfect curls I've ever seen on my head fell down into place.  After my hair was dry completely, I was in total shock at how soft, manageable, shiny, and perfect my curls were.

Because my hair is so terribly thick and usually frizzy, I typically have to pull back the top half of my hair into a clip behind my head. Not today.  My hair didn't poof out at all. I now have magazine-worthy hair!  Thanks Philip B!",1
"i didn't buy this from Amazon, but the product is not like what it says.  When i use this after my foundation, it makes my skin flaky, the foundation becomes uneven on the skin - and basically need to wash it.",0
No problems after 2 yrs,1
This stuff is really thin. Though it was going to have baking soda coated on it but I sure don't feel it. I can make my own baking soda coated floss much better than this. Too bad . . .,0
"It works decently, but you need to use a lot, and my roots are pretty subtle.  Considering how expensive this was, I won't be buying it again.",0
When I first put this on I was like wow I look like a ghost but then the white started to fade after a couple minutes and i have fallen in love with it. It is great to go under makeup but even if you don't wear makeup it seems to be good and not too oily. I will probably try out a new moisturizer after this one because the smell is a little weird.,1
After 3 weeks of taking this vitamin my hair stopped falling out. I have lots of new growth and stronger nails as well.,1
"I think the product is good, however the smell made me nauseated and I couldn't stand to put it on my face. It was a waste of money for me.",0
It just didn't do the job for me.,0
This is one of those products that it depends on who you ask.  I did not like this product it burned my skin.  Made my skin red like a sun burn.  I have used their competitors version of this type of product and thought it was much better and cheaper as well.  I don't recommend or not recommend.,0
Love this product!  Covers well lasts all day. Always looks fresh from morning to night also easy to travel with!,1
This cream is a little thick,1
"To preface, I'm going to be updating my review as time goes by. I don't want to wait until the 3 month mark to post my final thoughts on the product, because I'm worried I'll forget small details of early usage, and because I feel like even if I don't have a final ""does this work?"" verdict, I think I can still offer some useful information.

General first impressions: This thing is surprisingly heavy. Not that it's straining to hold, but I actually take it as a good sign. This isn't just a cheap hunk of plastic, there's actually something going on inside.
It does not arrive charged- you need to allow about 2 hours for charging time before you can play with this, so account for that. Before every use, you need to clean, shave, and dry the area. And that's something I really love about this product. My current preferred method of hair removal in the summer is epilating (many tweezers plucking out the hair from the root), and the real problem with that (and waxing) is that you need to allow the hair to grow out to a considerable length, and having to be hairy for the sake of hair removal is just stupid and it sucks. But this product allows you to continue shaving! However, a couple things to mention regarding this:
1) The manual states you should allow 6 weeks between waxing/plucking/epilating and using this product, to fully allow the hair to grow back
2) The main reason I bought this was to finally be done with having to pluck my beard/sideburns every damn morning (yes, I'm a woman). And I'm not too crazy about having to switch to shaving my face. My facial hair is sparse enough that thankfully it won't give me a 5 o'clock shadow, but the hairs themselves are very thick and coarse so shaving just leaves me with noticeable black speckles that I'm not going to be happy about. So if you're not willing to shave your face, do not purchase this with the intent to use it on your face.

I also want everyone to note that, buried in the instructions manual is one tiny warning paragraph that in some cases, this product was shown to actually INCREASE hair growth. But it mentioned that it was largely only found to happen to woman of more exotic ethnicities. So be warned about that.

The final thing I think that's worth mentioning is that the instructions manual advises using this product every 2 weeks (per area). So you can alternate between areas every week. For example, do your pits and face this Sunday, and legs next Sunday. But I see a lot of reviews saying they're using it a lot more frequently than that. And while I'm no scientist or body hair expert, I definitely will not be doing that and I wouldn't advise anyone to do that either. The entire point of the 2 weeks is because your body hair is constantly in different stages of growth. And the goal is to get every follicle of hair in all the different cycles. Doing it every single day, you're just zapping the exact same hair follicles. And when there's a limited number of zaps, you're just throwing money away. Follow the instructions, and use the provided schedule to keep track of when to zap which area and to keep a rough estimate of how many zaps you've gone through overall.

4-26-18: First treatment, complete. I've done my face and one armpit. I'm going to hold off on doing the other pit for the sake of seeing how well this actually works. I was very surprised to find that is actually didn't hurt at all. I did a couple zaps on the lower settings, but felt absolutely nothing, so I cranked it up to full blast and got what felt like a warm to hot static electricity zap. Every few zaps would be mildly uncomfortable, but no where near painful. It's easy to use and incredibly quick. I anticipate the legs to take a lot longer, but I don't expect it to be as tedious as epilating has been. The nicest thing about this is that the hair doesn't immediately fall out, so you can safely use this on the couch or in bed watching a movie or something. You don't need to pluck yourself down on a cold metal foldy chair over tiled floor for easy clean up, because there is NO clean up. I noticed while doing my face, the areas where I know I have denser hair growth were the more uncomfortable zaps. So I'm inclined to believe it's working, if I can actually feel it getting to the root of a cluster of hairs.",1
Love this product,1
This product is easy to use and does the job.  Better than most alternatives out there.  It is a step in the right direction for covering up the grey between appointments!,0
Best product out on the market.  I am sad to say that this will be in my bathroom cabinet till the day I day.,1
I was ended up purchasing with prime but there was no seal on the product and I'm always skeptical of beauty products purchased through prime without a seal. The product looks and smells authentic but you never really know.,0
Great! My nails get stronger and longer. Knife like ,1
"Very disappointed! I saw NO results! and I used it everyday as it said to, its no better than coconut oil just less greasy!!",0
"Very poorly made, does not file, just slips around the nail edge. Very disappointing.  Sold and shipped by Amazon, yet NOT eligible for a return. Why?!? I would not waste my money on this product.",0
I have used this product for about a month. Everytime I use it my face gets soooo dry. Very unhappy with it. Will not purchase again.,0
This must be old stock they bought or something. The mascara was pretty dried out and flaked off right away. Ive used this before so this is probably just a rip off vendor. Buy it from blinc trust me.,0
"When I received this, I immediately noticed the plastic was re wrapped and there was, what seemed like, adhesive on the side of the box. Unfortunately, cannot be returned and replaced due it being considered a hazardous material. We'll give it a try to see if it was just a packaging issue. Slightly disappointed.",0
"I bought this stuff expecting to actually define my curls, but on the contrary it actually causes my hair to frizz even more. I have thin medium-length curly hair, that tends to lose its curl definition very easily. First day after showering this stuff makes my hair look defined and not frizzy (hence the two stars), and it smells really good. However, its really thick and sticky when you apply it. Second hair day is AWFUL. my curls are crispy and just out of place. I expected much better since it is Argan oil based. I've used it several times before writing this review and I do not like it.",0
Love this! Been using the shampoo and conditioner and leave in for a while now. I live in a dry climate and have waist length wavy hair. It works great during the winter when the temperatures drop and my hair gets a lot of static.,1
"Unfortunately after a month it did nothing to help my daughters cystic acne. It's worse. Now trying other treatment, also don't work!",0
"Thought I was getting the Keratin Chi, but have not been disappointed with this product.",1
This product works amazingly!! I have a lot of fine curly hair that gets tangled very easily and once I spray this in my hair my brush goes through with so much ease!!!,1
Shaving cream has a nice scent but that is where the good ends.  Does not lather well and as others have said - is very clumpy.  No matter how much you work it with  a brush pieces - sometimes quite large - will not dissolve/lather up so you end up clogging the blade and getting a mediocre shave.  Going back to Taylors,0
This polish is a lovely colour but seems a little thin in consistency. Also not keen on the brush that comes with Essie polish. I think considering the price this is a decent product but would love to see Essie do something about brush size as it tends to make applying polish a bit more fiddly and more likely to streak. Cute colour though!,1
"I ordered 2 jars of Zirh Rejuvenate, having used it for several years - previously purchasing it through the Zirh website.  I have sensitive skin, and Zirh products are about the only products I've found that work well and do not irritate my skin.  Being used to paying $43 on the Zirh website, I jumped at the $14.99 price on Amazon, through Club Distributors.  I received the 2 jars and the ""cream"" was the consistency of milk, and spilled all over the counter when opened.  Both jars were the same consistency.  It was almost as if the distributor is re-mixing the product adding water to an unusable consistency and product.  Could just be a freak quality issues with a few jars, however, I never experienced any Zirh product issues through the Zirh website.  Having said that, in this order I also ordered some Zirh Platinum after shave balm and Zirh Shave Gel, and both products (through Amazon distributors other than Club Distributors), were the excellent products I'm familiar with.  I'll be sending the defective product back to Zirh.  My suspicion is this product was 66% less than the Zirh website for a reason.

Update to the above review:
I ended up ordering another jar of Zirh Rejuvenate from Amazon for $14.99, because I observed it was from a different supplier - NetMart.  The previous two jars fulfilled through Amazon by Club Distributors"" were entirely watered down.  The jar received from NetMart was the real deal.  Unfortunately, I am not able to attach a photo to this review, showing the watered down version from Club Distributors, compared to the actual product from NetMart.  So when ordering Zirh products through Amazon, just make certain the supplier is not Club Distributors.",0
"This is a great dry shampoo-type product.  No weird color, lovely smell (although it will be too much if you have fragrance sensitivities).  Powerful spray.  I've tried many of them and am liking this one the best.",1
"This is the greatest stuff for your hair.  My hair stylist always uses it on my hair, and it makes it so much softer, shinier and it dries faster, and it smells so good.  I highly recommend it - it only takes the amount about the size of a pea, and you apply it right after you shampoo.",1
"I used a small sample of this before so when I saw the excellent price for the large size I bought it right away.  This is a very good quality hand lotion.  It absorbs quickly and leaves your hands silky-smooth.  There is no animal testing, which is important to many people. However,  I do wish they offered an unscented option.",1
"OMG What can I tell you except this oil is amazing! My hair is naturally dry and frizzy so when I decided to use permminent hair color a couple of times my hair became so dried and fried and actually broke off, but after using this healing oil for a week I could see the difference. My hair feels so soft and I don't find a pile of hair on the floor after I have styled it. It is very light weight and you can use it on either wet or dry hair. All I can say is where have you been all my life.",1
Love it! Just don't know if I prefer it over the green container.,1
"My search for the best self-tanner, one that leaves skin looking sun-kissed without an orange hue, has lead me to this product. I tried a countless # of self-tanners, from drugstore brands to pricey high-end ones, and none compared to the results I received with this product. This leaves skin with a natural looking tan, a color that I would achieve by spending hours out in the sun (I am olive complexed). I initially used this 3 nights in a row (apply before bedtime) to achieve my desired color and have been re-applying twice weekly to maintain.  There are 2 products that are ""recommended"" that you use before applying the bronzant that I didn't bother wasting my $ on since this is pricey enough (hence the 4 stars).",1
this a good product a little bit too expensive if you ask me,1
Color coming off and warping,0
"Product is wonderful, but the bottle was unsealed and smells different than usual.  Questioning if it is authentic.  I'm going to order directly from the company.",0
Love this cologne. My husband smells great!,1
This is my first DE razor and I am very happy with it thus far. Wish it was stainless. Would buy again and have recommended it already to some friends.,1
"I have had this product for about 16 months now, but haven't used much. I turned it on the other day, put it to my face and pulled the trigger. There was immediately a pop and a puff of smoke coming from one of the side vents. So greatful I wasn't harmed, but upset that it broke so quickly with minimal use. I feel like I just chucked $150 in a fire.",0
The shampoo in the 8oz bottles comes out more like the consistency of toothpaste. The shampoo in the gallon bottle comes out like water. I cant say for a fact that they water it down but I don't see any other explanation.,0
the product was shaken up when it was delivered to my house :(,0
the bottle started oxidizing. it was gross,0
"Very Nice, that I ordered it again for my wife's thinning hair..",1
"Ok, this shampoo has a great smell and cleanses your hair very well. A little drop of shampo makes a huge lather, so less is more. I gave it 2 stars because it drys your hair out SO BAD!! I mean your hair will be bone dry, and there is no shine or luster either! I would prob recommend this hair care product for anyone that has extremely oily hair - otherwise, save yourself the trouble.",0
"I Love Paul Mitchel spray.  It keeps me hair looking nice even when the wind blows.  Everyone that uses a soft to the feel, but does its job should get the Fast Dry Sculpting Spray.  It came when Amazon said it would arrive  Thanks",1
Gave my boy a rash!!!,0
"Great little comb, does just what it's supposed to do.  It really is small (which is what I wanted), and perfect at getting to my stache under the nose without scraping my nose.  Also does well in the beard area (I have about a 1.5"" beard) and works great.  I'm not into carrying a lot in my pocket, so will keep this one at home and probably purchase another one to have at work.  Very quickly shipped and just what I was expecting the comb to be.",1
"Consistent use of this syrum has transformed my acne prone skin, won't be without it!",1
"One of the draws for this iron is the static control for fine hair. It simply isn't true. I had lots of static issues with it and at this price, expected more.",0
"I love Replenix, BUT I'm suspicious of this product and may return it. This product has a different color lighter brown than the darker brown I'm used to from purchasing at dermatology offices. I would like to have more feedback from the seller. This seems fake but I am not 100% sure",0
Gets hot quickly. Hot Tools curling irons always work well and last a long time. I would recommend this curling iron.,1
"I'm not blessed with luxuriously thick hair. Instead I was born with very fine, limp hair. and so I'm always on the lookout for any type of volumizing hair product.

I've been using this product on and off now for a few weeks. I followed another reviewer's advice to use only a very tiny amount (less than a dime-sized dollop) and mix it in with my conditioner. (Trying to the masque w/o first mixing it with conditioner led to a horrible greasy weighed-down mess). You can really feel the ""heat-activated"" product on your scalp.  I don't always like to blow-dry my hair after washing, but blow-drying is a must after using this masque to help blast away the extra buildup left on my scalp.

Conclusion: my hair looks a bit thicker but also feels weighed down and definitely requires more effort to shampoo it clean afterwards. I'll keep using this product when I want a little extra volume and have the extra time that's needed to devote to styling it afterwards.",1
Tube kept in metal container but mascara dried out in less than a month.,0
"I was in love with this product when I first got it, and I had it for a little over a year but it seems like it doesn't really straighten my hair anymore. But it worked fantastically for the first year. My mom has one and hers still works great.",1
My wife really likes what it does to my beard. I am not crazy about the cost but it does make my beard feel softer and lusher.,1
The formula seems to have changed. It is too heavy on the hair now and doesn't control the frizz like it used to.,0
"I'm not great at applying eyeliner but I've found this to be the easiest to apply so far.  I goes on smoothly and once it dries, it does not smear.  It is a little tricky to get it all the way off though!",1
"Stinks, I'll do much better using a q tip with remover on it",0
Ridiculous,0
"it has ,my hair dry and it doesnt really do anything good for me really",0
"I lived in Europe for years and used this product for long time, now I live in the US and bought it from Amazon for the first time. The texture of the step 3 cream is so disgusting like milk gone bad, never seen any cream like that... I just could not put that on my face!!",0
"I have baby fine hair and I needed a little help around the hairline. No matter what I did I couldn't get it to adhere properly or look natural. The texture  difference between my silky hair and the product was noticeable. I would get some fallout throughout the day which caused horrible eye irritation..I could see how this might help for people who need it more on the crown, but for me not good.",0
As advertised...,1
Meh.  Not strong. Not worth the price not anything special,0
Very great moisturizer and came very fast. The scent is very sweet like bath and body works dark kiss was. A little too sweet for me. The lavender is my favorite scent from OPI so far. Very pretty and light. The orchid scent can be overpowering. Overpowered my perfume today.,1
My favorite fragrance,1
"After reading all the reviews posted before me, I thought that maybe a couple of people had received the wrong product. No, sadly, this straightener was a fake. It is made from very light plastic and the tong plates do not meet, only the tips. This product would be impossible to use. It went straight back in the box to be returned.

Please don't order this product hoping you'll luck out and get the real product because you won't. I'm not sure the other reviewers who said they did are real. So please walk away and do not order this at all.",0
I guess I didn't understand what this was and that you needed some sort of light? It smells so toxic I was afraid I was poisoning myself. I didn't know about the light so it never even came close to drying and wiped right off. Regular nail polish is fine.,0
I love the product the smell of the rosemary is powerful at first but does disparate after a while. However if you enjoy that smell it won't bother you at all!,1
"I used this account (my boyfriend's) to order this curling iron. And I didn't have it for very long, but it already doesnt get as hot as it used to. It also doesn't curl my hair at all.",0
this is really a very pale peachy color that looks like little kids pretend polish on my nails.  Thought it was more salmony-coral.,0
"I bought this mascara because I hate getting raccoon eyes by noon.  It works fine for that, but my lashes looked clumpy and spikey.  When I tried to get it off, many of my lashes came out with it.  I was hoping it was only the tubes, but at closer inspection - many of my lashes were still in the tubes.  I have a friend who really likes it and it looks great on her, I just wish I had the same results.",0
"I used to love this night cream. But since the formulation change, I find it to be too heavy and oily on my combination skin. Plus, the scent changed some. I'm disappointed.",0
"doesn't last long and not worth the money. If you have very thinning hair, try something else. You would have to pour a bucket of this on your hair if you want results and you'll just be wasting your money because it will look fake and gone within hours due to sweat and humidity.",0
Never buy nail polish online.  You really can't see the color well. Did not like.,0
"I used to use the Shu Uemura eyelash curler until Sephora stopped selling it. After that, I tried many different curlers trying to find one that even came close to the Shu Uemura one, and the Japonesque one comes pretty close. I have very straight lashes and this curler curls them pretty well, and it's great that Japonesque will provide free curler pad refills for the life of the curler.",1
"This is my all-time favorite everyday sunscreen, for sure; I use it every day year-round. It does irritate my eyes a little, but so do all sunscreens, since my eyes are sensitive. It rubs in totally clear and without a white cast very quickly (although it does leave your face looking a bit shiny, I usually wear it under makeup, so it's not an issue). I love the hygienic pump dispenser and it dispenses almost exactly the right amount for full sun protection for my face and neck. I recommend this to everyone looking for a good daily sunscreen.",1
"If you have thick hair pay the extra $10 for a curling iron that gets hotter. This one doesnt hold the curls for very long. Just traded this one in for the babyliss pro. I'm giving this one away to my sister, who has thinner hair. Hope it works for her!",0
"It is pricey for what it is, yes, but it really did work for me. I put it on at night on any spots where I feel acne coming in and it does really help to dry the area out. Definitely don't use on broken skin though, you will quickly learn the hard way that that does not feel so good. I usually use a Q-Tip to dip and then apply, do not shake or mix before use, let it remain separated.",1
Love it.,1
Good,1
"Normally love the product, but when it arrived I was VERY disappointed by the way it was packaged. The conditioner had leaked all down the bottle. It took me awhile to clean up the mess. It was shipped in a box that was too small and the conditioner was leaking everywhere, 1/4 of the product was wasted and I will likely have to transfer it to another bottle.",0
Does not work!!! I tried right after I recieved the product and the tip is not allowing suction. Have had this issue before with the Nubrilliance tips. Can you send a new one?,0
Was very good to my dry hair.,1
"very greasy... heavy.. not a type guys dig for...
get highr end ones like Lab series, Kiehls...
money talks..
spend 25$ on lotion, it's worth it..",0
The perfect shampoo. Not to strong just perfect!,1
"It may be a little pricy, but I think it's worth it. It's cute, stylish, and durable. The silicone seems to protect it well. Would have given it 5 stars, but I keep the water bottle in the fridge overnight, and the sleeve seems to absorb any food smells, and emit them very faintly for the next few hours. Not a big deal to me. I'd buy another if I needed one.",1
"I love this product, but to be honest, I think it is for those with few skin problems like dryness or constant breakouts.  The coverage is outstanding and it looks flawless when it sets, however, if my face is dry in certain areas or if I'm having a ""bad skin"" day, it can enhance it, which is why I gave it a four.  Be sure to use a light moisturizer prior to use.",1
For those who want to re build their natural nails after acrylic or gel nails are removed this is the product for them.  Does as it is advertised to do.  Wish it weren't so expensive.,1
"Been using a week so far. No difference on arms or chest and I exercise since using this. How long before u see any kind of difference. It seems to dry my skin
 GOLD BOND strength and resilience does not dry your skin up",0
"awesome product and fast delivery .
thanks",1
Fantastic!,1
No I haven't seen any change i t seems it needs to be used with other Jan Marini products I will try with it's cleanser and see what happens please advise,0
My skin always felt soft and smooth after using these and it helped clear up some acne.,1
I've been using this product for over a year.  Love it.  Help my hair from being flat..,1
My favorite perfume ever. I like the spicy men's fragrances. This gives me that spicy scent with a feminine touch.,1
It's ok! I was expecting more from this product. It's basically silicon,0
Good spray that generally holds up but the bottle nozzle gets closed up.  Could be much better.,1
"I like to wear face lotion, sunblock and sometimes foundation (unless its a tinted moisturizer). I got this one because it seemed to have the four important things I care for: lotion, sunblock and tint (all for rosacea), but its really a tinted sunblock. If thats what you are looking for go for it, but if you need lotion beware this won't give it to you. Also the smell is really strong.",0
doesn't seem to do much except make head itch,0
"I love Framesi products, they make my hair feel like silk, this too!",1
I love the Sunscreen but not the lip balm. The balm was not creamy nor easily guided on. I wish I hadn't bought it and could return it. I love their sunscreens.,0
this smells awesome no doubt but product came in with some sort of leak in the top area ???? I got it way to early as Christmas present for my husband because I knew with a newborn I would not had time for shopping so for the same reason I wasn't even able to complaint nor return,0
So perfect,1
"I thought this would work and wanted to try it for at least 6 weeks before writing a review. I took before and after pictures to compare. Unfortunately, it made my nails worse. I generally keep my nails short and wash my hands very frequently, so my nails are weak. I thought this would be a lifesaver, but it just looked messy when you would layer more over every other day, and the corners would snag my hair, eventually chipping off. I think I'm going to try a natural remedy which is soaking nails in olive oil for 10-15 minutes a day. Maybe that will be more successful : (",0
This product is very rich and the shea butter in it will help you nourish your dry skin. Love it!,1
"I guess I should have realized this would be yellow by having ""chick"" in the polish name. It didn't look that yellow on my phone. It's definitely yellow, not the neutral color I was expecting.",0
"Based on the reviews, I bought this shampoo with high expectations, my hair never get tangled the way it does now with a dryness never been experienced before. Very disappointed!!!",0
"Love the smell, very light",1
Never disappoints!,1
"First let me tell you that I've owned this fragrance before and it's lovely!  Clean, light and fresh.  That being said, this is a much watered down version of the fragrance I've had in the past.  Two minutes after applying it, there's nothing.  And I mean NOTHING.  It doesn't last past the initial spritz.  I've purchased two, used a half of the first bottle just trying to make it noticeable.  I'm going to send the second one back.  Then re-purchase from HSN for more money but much better results.  Sorry :(  I was really looking forward to the lovely scent for such a great price.

4/7/15  Update---the company I purchased this from was GREAT!  Apparently you cannot send these items back, but, they refunded my money just the same!  FIVE STARS for this company, but, still just one star for the product  :(",0
"I really like this product, and I am pretty particular with makeup.  I got a sample of this through ipsy and immediately went online to order the palette. I highly recommend.",1
"It feels different then the first one I purchased thru a sales woman who came to our office a while back.  And this time, I had a reaction to it,  I broke out with acne and I never get acne.",0
"Exactly what I wanted. Prompt delivery with free shipping! Who could ask for more? I only wish they had more.
Billy Boy",1
Love the smell.,1
Had this since March to replace my last Hot Tools curling iron that I had for years. This morning the screw holding the spring in place popped out. It is stripped and cant be fixed. Ive used this curling iron maybe once a week since the beginning of March. And it is now outside the return window for Amazon. Very disappointed in the poor construction as I loved the way it curled my hair.,0
"Nice product, but it leaves a residue on my leather car interior.",1
"This was only the second commercial beard oil or beard balm that I have tried. Typically I have had them custom made for me by a relative who is into essential oils. But this product is a good stand in. I appreciate the product for what it is now. It is Cruelty-Free, Vegan, Gluten-Free, Sulfates (SLS or SLES) and Paraben Free, Petrolatum and Mineral Oil Free. It smells good, is easy to apply and works well. I am prone to ingrown hairs where my beard comes in thickest and this is soothing and calming. It helps to take away the itch and alleviate the desire to just shave it off. Worked well and even got a bottle to pass on to a friend.",1
This cream is rich and very moisturizing. I love the way it plumps up my skin and the wrinkles appear to fade.,1
"I used product only once.  It filled my pores with the green color so did not effectively ""cover"" my roscea redness.  Very disappointed because I was looking for a more natural mineral based product for redness coverage.  I returned this product.",0
Love me some PCA....I use almost all the products for anti aging and pigmentation.  Love it!  The peels are the BEST!,1
nice shimmer,1
Used to really like the product but the massive price increase has me looking for alternative options. The stuff works but I can't justify spending over $500 per year for this stuff.,0
The spray nozzle on this can does not work !!!!,0
"Great product. Shipped to me quickly, will use them again.",1
"Putting scent aside, this candle was an absolute joke.  Out of the box, its initial light stayed lit for 20 minutes before dying out. After continually scooping out wax and giving this candle several opportunities to burn again, it never stayed lit for more than 20 minutes. Very frustrating. As a candle enthusiast, I will never buy from this company again.  Was the candle I bought just an anomaly with a defective wick? Maybe, maybe not. I personally will never know unless someone sends me one free.",0
This is a good product....while it works. I have had 2.  They have a one year warranty and they have both broken at month 13.  I contacted the company with the first broken product and they told me that they could not do anything and I would need to purchase another.,0
"Love the dryer. Occasionally have to hit the fuse switch on the power adapter, it too easily disengages,but it's a great dryer.",1
This is a rip off. These are all tiny samples that you could get for free anywhere in the mall. Do not pay for this. Horrible purchase.,0
Smells great just like all other Loccitane products. There are other products I prefer from Loccitane for moisturizing though. I think my hands are just a little too dry for this to work for that purpose. I use it more as a fragrance around my neck and cleavage area. The odor is somewhat relaxing to me.  It will not be wasted.,1
"For me the product was too strong.  My skin was itching something terrible.  I won't be using  so I can't give an assessment of it's claim to fame, if you have sensitive skin -  this product may be too strong for you also.  I recommend doing a test in a small area, if it turns red and/or began to itch send it back.",0
It really works. My husband had several spots on his head where his hair was very thin and showed signs of balding. Nioxin 1 has restored hair growth. Only a small amount about the size of a dime is needed to wash and restore.,1
Great lotion. Just wished it had the Turbo Wash scent.,1
"Product itself seems to do what it says it will do, but the scent is pretty nasty. Smells a bit like old after shave.",0
Got this for my husband for Christmas....the top part of the razor literally broke off in the middle of shaving.,0
"its ok. its very convenient to just spray on your face, i like that part, however its very greasy and makes your face look like an oil slick.",1
"Excellent product worth what you pay for, I am satisfied with this purchase",1
"Sort of disappointed.  I thought paying a little more the straighter would make it work better and stay straight longer, but in my personal experience that was not the case.",0
Didn't know it had nail polish. I have gel nails. I will give it to one of my granddaughters.,1
Not good,0
Not worth your money. Didn't work on my coarse natural hair.,0
Best shampoo I have ever used.,1
"Maybe it's too soon to be writing this review but I started using this 1 week ago and I paired it with the Aztec secret face mask and my skin which was filled with acne is almost completely free of acne!!! I'm hoping as I continue to use this and the mask it'll clear my acne completely, which by the looks of it it will. This thing is a life savior, I've literally tried it all, name a product, I've used it. This is the first product that has made a big difference. I'm so glad to have finally found something that works for me :)",1
It's just not doing anything spectacular - does not improve on things I could buy at the grocery store. Will be moving on to another product in the quest for a high-end face cream.,0
I would like to give negative stars if I could. The WORST SHAMPOO I have ever used. Made my hair so dry-like STRAW. Very expensive and terrible. Suave works better!,0
"Didn't work for me. Used the whole bottle, but didn't notice any difference in skin tightening. Cost too much. Now I'm trying the Strivectin concentrate for stretch marks. A friend used & her skin looked great. I hope I get the same results.",0
Great product,1
This product stains your sheets and clothes,0
"I thought based on the name, ""Super Shiney"" I would have gotten a wet sexy finish to my nails.  Sadly it was not the case it was dull and nothing special.  It's unfortunate because the stickey base coat works well.  I thought the combination of the two would make for an attractive mani. I was wrong.",0
"My expectations for this product were pretty high. I love the Jack Black brand, and their fragrances. Pretty convenient packing / form factor for the deodorant as well. Product smells pretty good, and other reviews here on amazon were pretty positive. So, I took a chance and spent almost $15 on this single deodorant stick. The problem: it didn't work at all. I work in an office, and ended up with smelly pits by the end of the day. I was previously using Old Spice Hawkridge, which worked fantastically (and at a fraction of the price!). In short, this product ended up being a waste of my money. Don't waste your money on this, too!",0
No scent,0
great smell,1
"I bought this a few months ago, have used maybe a dozen times and it's stopped working.  Really disappointed.",0
The color doesn't hold . It starts to bleed through  and you see patches of discolor. I've used vinyl for some time but the light color doesn't hold it's own.,0
I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. It smells fresh and sophisticated! He wears this for work.,1
"WOW! What a lift me up! Dr. Jessica YU, the LA Dermatologist DR. to the stars wrote about this recently and swears by its benefits so I bought it here on Amazon. It' s quite refreshing and seems to give me an instant lift-me-up FEELING. Interesting what mineral water does. Just feels GREAT & moisturizes where ever you spray it on. I carry a smaller can in my handbag as I tend to 'sweat' in stores when shopping and makes me feel cooler when there is isn't any air-flow cool nor warm in malls or stores. Allows me keep on shopping for things I want and need. Finally found something for those nasty hot flashes for the last 20 years. Red-heads need this Thermal Spring water...you know what I mean too.",1
Very small. Didn't like it!!!,0
I received this product in On 7/10 and it did not meet expectations. There was no expiration date  and it was obviously expired because it did not do what he was suppose to do . I had to purchase another one locally and it working just fine.,0
"This is a softening and non-greasy lotion, with lots of all natural ingredients, but...the smell.

This lotion is called Green Apple, which might lead you to expect an orchard like scent. Unfortunately, it doesn't even have a natural smell, despite the many naturally fruity contents. The first thing that came to mind upon smelling it is artificial lemon-scented dish detergent.

It may very well be good for the skin and have some fine ingredients, but It's so unpleasant, I can't see myself continuing to use it.",0
This heats up way too hot.  It burned my hands and head.  I returned it.,0
This has not met my expectations at all.,0
Does not work as expected.,0
Exactly like the salon. Smells awesome.,1
"I wanted to like this so badly, but after months of use following the instructions exactly, it actually made my nails worse! They were constantly flaking off and breaking. My doctor told me that nail polish is drying, so I experimented by stopping use of this for about a month. Because I don't have a ton of patience, I went and got a shellac manicure and let that grow out and my nails have been so much stronger since they aren't constantly being painted with this stuff! Use at your own risk.

Update: it has been months since Ive used this nail polish. I got gel manicures about every month for a few months and now my nails have been naked for about 3 months and they have been stronger than ever. So glad I ditched this product.",0
"This is my 3rd T3.  First I had a featherweight one but as I didn't buy from an authorized dealer the warranty dept wouldn't replace.  Well my 2nd t3 was the Veloce and I loved it.  It was fast and didn't leave my hair fried or frizzy.  Well after 6 months or so, it wouldn't turn on anymore.  I checked the cord everything and still nothing.  Thankfully I bought from an authorized dealer and the warranty dept did replace.  But now here it is another 9 months or so later and when I turned on the replacemnet, one of the fans inside fell apart...in the morning right before I had to go to work!  I have loved the t3 line but it seems that they are cheaply made and require constant replacement and repair.  Not good if you're a salon stylist or even use it at home alot.  And seeing as they run into the $100-300 range you expect it to last.  Sadly as much as I have loved these hair dryers, I can't afford to keep buying em if they are going to burn out or break once a year...I can't really recommend em to anyone either despite the positives.",0
worse polish I have ever worn,0
Bought less than a year ago. Used only a few times. Went to use it today and it doesn't heat up.,0
"I have really thick, wavy hair that used to take me at least 45 min to straighten on the max setting. I read the reviews for this CHI and decided to upgrade.  After using it for a couple of weeks let me tell you - it is worth every penny! I can finish straightening my hair in 20-25 minutes at 415, it's comfortable to hold, and it heats up so fast! I couldn't believe it.  I like the digital and color coded heat settings, and that they're inside so I don't hit them when I'm holding it.  It came with a beautiful red foldable case, and the cord is extremely long.  It has saved me so much time in the morning and my hair looks great every time - I highly recommend it!",1
"perfect so far. have only had 1 week. Need to buy the spray, as gel dries quickly. Will check back",1
So far this product has not helped the skin on my back at all. I will continue to exfoliate and use this in hopes that I experience an improvement in my skin.,0
"This product struggled a lot to remove gel-based eyeliner, when from the marketing you'd expect it to be universal. Aside from that it's been a very standard experience. Goes on easily, leaves your face feeling fresh and clean, good for sensitive skin. Takes off foundation and facial makeup very well. Recommended.",1
Very good shampoo and does actually give magnificent volume.  I love it.,1
2nd bottle already...great product.,1
Ordered soap on a rope and got just the soap. Returned it and reordered soap on a rope and once again received just the soap,0
Love that the polish is free of all the crap that's in most polishes. I had  a pedi and the polish has lasted for ever. I used to only use OPI polish but now I'm a London Butter gal.,1
"This works super well for my curly dry hair. It smells great, leaves it soft and shiny, but does not weigh it down or look greasy. I prefer it to much more expensive products.",1
Original,1
"Bummed this did nothing for my skin but make it break out. I have clear skin always.  I was hoping to find a product that would help tighten my clear skin, not make it break out.  Back to dermalogica and Image skincare! Glad I tried though.",0
"I don't know that it actually ""cools"" me down, but it is very light and does rub in very quickly and I certainly don't feel ""hotter"" with it on like I do with some other waterproof sunscreens.  I also prefer SPF 30 or so rather than the super zinc-ey SPFs of 50 or higher.  I'd rather reapply than feel like my skin can't breathe, this lotion works the way I want it to.",1
Didn't like this product.  Way to difficult to remove.,0
"This is great. I use it on a daily basis. Great for any problem spot you may have. Just use it in the shower, and you will see results.",1
"Very nice light rosewater type scent, performs ok  like all the other ones. Not my favorite but a decent value.",1
"This stick is really tiny and you have to apply a good amount of the cream to cover the whole face. Even though you don't have a mess with sticking sunsceen while applying, you still have to use your hand to even it out on the child's face.
I normally really like Miatela peosuct, but this one is not convenient.",0
"I have been using this product since it first came out, and loved it...This new batch seems to have changed.....the cans do not spray well and it doesn,t hold my hair as before.....will be looking for another product....",0
Even tho I have fine hair its so chemically damaged that most heavy products aren't a problem. This was too waxy and heavy for my hair for daily use. Its not as bad if I flat iron my hair after so Ill save it for that.,0
It melted when I tried different values of heat after 2 weeks of used. Also when I put it in level 1 it heat up to the maximun. stay away of this.,0
"I was a bit disappointed in this box. As, a regular purchaser of beauty boxes from other companies I have come to expect a certain value out of beauty boxes. Most of the samples were very small (In many situations some of these samples would be offered for free). I only got about 80% of the pictured beauty box and other items were added. The pro is, if there is a product I like I will get a credit for that item, so I guess it may be worth it in the end.",0
"This sunscreen offers great protection, but it is impossible to scrub off.  I also tried removing it with make-up remover, but it was still hard to remove.  It also whitens on the skin, an affect that becomes more pronounced after swimming.  I would not purchase again.",0
"I love this lotion. Love it love it love it! I suffer from hormonal acne, so I get large cysts on my face on a weekly basis. I dab a little of this using a q-tip on each cyst at night after cleansing and applying moisturizer. It takes a few times before I noticed a significant drying effect on each cyst, but this DEFINITELY shortens the lifespan! Don't get frustrated if you don't see a result the next morning. For the larger cysts I usually don't see a result for 2-3 days of use.",1
"This is not a lotion but an opaque oil.  It is heavily scented and goes on greasy.  I find that if I put it on early enough ahead of my makeup, I can go ahead and apply makeup over it, but immediately after application my face feels oily and not a good surface to apply makeup.  Thankfully, the scent also fades, because it's really strong and would not only clash with my cologne but is overpowering so close to my nose. I love scented products but this one is a bit much even for me.  One pump is enough only for my face; if I want to include my neck and decollete I need two.

How does it work? My face feels moisturized and ""plumper"" after application. I don't think it does a whole lot to minimize the look of fine lines and wrinkles that are already there.  I have to trust that it's working in the long run, but short-term there's not a lot to go on.

Basically, I like how my face feels after applying this serum, but the scent is really too much for me.",1
"If you FOLLOW DIRECTIONS,  it works perfectly for whiteheads,  at least for me.  Does not work on the occasional cystic acne that I get. But it DOES only say whiteheads on the bottle.",1
"Color was beautiful, but the glitter in the product damages my nails.",0
I still have the full bottle. I don't feel like it makes a difference on my skin. It definitely did not unclog my pores.,0
"I am having trouble with the spray mechanism on my first can, which is basically full. Am hoping I don't have the same problem with the second can.",0
"good for light peeling , no more no less",0
"...but this scent has a more citrusy tang.  I like it much better than warm cotton, but still feel a little bit as if I smell of fabric softener.  It is definitely fresh and light and I will keep it.  I will probably wear it quite a bit, since I prefer clean scents.",1
"I wish I would have known that this product contains formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. Why would I want to brush that all over my nails and possibly risk it being absorbed into my skin? Worse yet, breathe in the fumes? If that wasn't a deal breaker alone, this turned my nails so disgustingly yellow that I had to wear an opaque polish at all times. The final straw was when my nails started cracking and getting brittle. Don't like this at all. I took the hype bait.",0
The cap was broken and taped closed.,0
Hair stylist suggested using this with shampoo as well an so far so good.,1
"The shadows weren't super easy to blend, there was quite a bit of fallout from the shadows, and the couple blue shades that look spectacular in the packaging just come off as very so-so, even on top of a good primer. I was disappointed enough that I gave this to a friend that isn't as into makeup as I am to play around with.",0
Bad product from 2011 never again,0
Great soap. Makes my face feel great all day long.,1
Doesn't really smell that great and made my hair feel heavy.,0
The bristles fall off the brush after use.  I also had two really bad burns with the surface touched my forehead.,0
"I am very happy with the sizes. These are small compacts, but a little bit of the product goes a long way. You can add more if you want more color and it goes on smoothly, stays exactly where you put it.  Both Camiela & Peony are the more natural peachy/brown colors-but not overwhelming. I am a winter, and these colors suit me fine in both summer when I am tan and winter with my pale skin. But I do have olive in my skin, Peony is a bit darker so I use it at night, Camiela is softer, so I wear it in the day time. Overall I am very satisfied but I do have two concerns:

1. Two of the colors, Camiela & Peony, seem to be in the same color family, whereas Tulip is very different. I can't see how all 3 colors would look right on the same person. But even with giving one away and keeping the 2 others, I am happy.

2. The product shipped in summer time so I expected it to get hot, but when it arrived on my doorstep I immeduately opened the package and these were melted :( I put them in the fridge and they returned to their original state. Stll, I wish this could have been avoided.",1
"I have thin straight hair and I have been using static guard to get rid of the static when I blow dry it. I wanted to get a product that was meant to use on your hair, and purchased this, which was recommend to me by a salon. It is pricey, ( same that is listed here) and for what you get in a bottle, I hesitated in case it didn't work.  It didn't work at all. I tried it on my hair when it was wet, and it still was full of static, so I then sprayed it all over after I finshed blow drying and it was still just as full of static.  I guess Im back to using static guard.",0
"Unlike Lancome lip liners that go on smoothly this was very sharp and hard and for one reason or another nothing showed up until I pressed on it several times.  Unfortunately by that time my lips were hurting, thus I never used it again.  Waste of time and money for me.",0
"I have used it for like 4 months, nobody really noticed a difference. not even much...6 months later my dad still says that i have short lashes so i used lilash..my lashes grew 3 times its volume and length..everyone asks if i have fake lashes or wear mascara.so if you want better lash enhencement, i'd reccomend Lilash over Jan Marini any day. i must warn you, Lilash does make ur eyes red for a couple of days.",0
"Feel -5- Very cooling and refreshing. Helps calm irritation on my neck without being too sticky

Smell -3- Something between a lemon hard candy and lemon wood polish. OK for spring and summer, but probably in a drawer otherwise. Doesn't linger for more than a few minutes from my experience but strong initial burst.

Overall -4- Will probably continue to use through the warm months, but will be looking something with more subtle tingle and smell for colder months",1
By the time I get where I am going it is gone. I expected it to last at least half of a day or evening.,0
"I only need to use a very small amount and it does a great job conditioning my hair especially since I dye it!  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it doesn't have as nice of a fragrance as I would like!  Combs out and dries beautifully!

Recommend by my salon.",1
YouTube made me buy it. I think it's all hype. Just fragrant water.,0
"Finally had the opportunity to try this trendy new beautiful product. I am very happy with my purchase. The dual bottles you receive in this package are a good size AND the product is fantastic. Roses smell good anyways, add in those extra nice ingredients and you have a great product. Not sure about using it under my makeup, but definitely love it as a moisturizer!",1
"It can be very difficult find a deodorant that doesn't contain aluminum or triclosan; even harder to find one free of these ingredients that actually works.  I am not a fan of the $18-20 price of Malin + Goetz, but it works much better than any of the $5 brands that I have tried.  Keep in mind that without the pore clogging aluminum, this isn't an anti-perspirant.  So, you may sweat slightly.  However, the eucalyptus and citronellyl seem to combat body odor very effectively.

I will continue to use this product unless something more cost effective comes on the market.",1
strong hold as long as you don't move your hair.,0
"It has taken awhile for my lashes to grow, about 2-1/2-3 months, but they have just like with Latisse. The difference is I don't have the brown color on my eyelids that Latisse leaves for most people. My lashes have also darkened where the new growth is. I am happy with the product.",1
"Great product, just a bit on the pricey side.",1
SOOOOOO disappointed. I bought this a month ago and have used it only 4-5 times. It worked great until I took it out of the cabinet to use it one day and it made a rattling noise as i held it up to my hair. I started using it and the the plastic end/top totally came off and part started falling out. I truly wanted to love it but clearly there was an issue with the product and i had already thrown the box out so I cannot return it. What a waste of $129. I wish the seller would be willing to replace the damaged item. It is dangerous and not usable now.,0
My hubby has very sensitive skin. He loves this shaving cream. He will never go back to any other brand.,1
My hair did not feel clean.,0
"Dried out super fast, not sure why, because I did close it tight.",0
Waste of money,0
"It does not blow as strongly as my old, ancient blow dryer, yet it dries my hair more quickly.  I also think it creates less frizz (I have curly hair, so a problem) when I try to straighten my curls.  It is light weight, so not hard to hold and move around.  It is not loud as too many are.  The cord is a generous length, so if your outlet is not near the mirror it should not be a problem.  I also purchased a hot sock diffuser to use when I want to keep the curls.  This fits on well and works really well at drying my hair quickly.
All in all, I definitely am glad I purchased this.  It is a good product.",1
"This product goes on smoothly and feels great on the skin.  It is not greasy at all.  Only 4/5 stars because the price $$$, and it goest quickly.  I would love a cheaper alternative.",1
"Great colors for blondes, but the shadows are very frosted. They look matte in the pan, but, in fact, they are quite shimmery on the lids. It's a bit much to use four frost shadows at once. So while I like the colors, I don't like all the shine.",1
I am addicted to this! It makes your hair feel so soft and un-frizzes it.,1
I gave it one star for being scent-free and because it doesn't leave a white cast. But it did not give me any volume nor did it absorb any oil. It actually made my hair look greasy. Big disappointment.,0
Product came falling out of the box the top loose and looking like someone had ripped it out of the box as it wasn't even intact will definitely not buy again,0
This is great stuff.  It leaves your hair instantly de tangled and smooth.  Be sure to rinse thoroughly and you will love the results.  Adds lots of shine!,1
I have tried the original and loved it. This one is strange. Soapy feel and very drying. Made me break out. Possibly not authentic?,0
"I'm afraid that in my opinion, the scent starts off with a hint of citrus (which I was hoping was the stronger scent) and develops quickly into what reminds me of cheap, expired perfume.  I can't stand it - I have to wash my hands.  Sigh. What a waste.  The quality of the lotion itself is amazing.  Should've stuck with the Avocado/Basil scent (which I LOVE).",0
Very hard to apply because product is so thick.  Leaves a white flaky residue when dry which has to be flaked off before you can apply makeup.,0
Used to love this stuff but I'm pretty sure they changed the formula and now the quality is sub-par.,0
Not sure how well it works yet . I just got mine . But mine is more like lotion not foaming . Maybe I received a dud,0
se sale al tocar facilmente,0
It is what It is. Get what you expect. Not that great at this price. Buy hemroid creme better results,0
"Been using this for years, nothing else works comparable for my hair.. love the consistency; moisurizes; controls frizz. However, I do wish the ingredients were a little more natural since I've started using more natural products for skin and hair.",1
"Good, I Like it",1
"I don't understand all the hype around this curling iron. It curls my hair just fine if I leave it on long enough, but it doesn't seem to heat up to an appropriate temperature, so it takes FOREVER to curl all my hair.",0
Great natural hair line!,1
The packaging doesn't work. Pump does not pump and it leaks from a small hole in the bottom of the container. What a mess!,0
This product sticks together and makes your hair stick together too.  Hair feels dirty.  Would not buy again!,0
My hair didn't feel clean after using it.,0
I had trouble using.,1
I purchased my first serum from Neiman Marcus and it actually worked very well.  The serum I purchased on line did not preform the same... or at all....I don't believe it is the same serum. I will purchase the serum again but from Neiman's.,0
My favorite of all time!!  Love OPI !!,1
"Discoloration:
First of all, if like to say I want I wasn't expecting a miracle. All my life I've had dark armpits and I hate it. I went to the dermatologist to see if she could help me and all she said was ""it'll cost you."" Upset at her lazy response I looked for alternatives myself and noticed the great reviews this was receiving and bought it. Within a few weeks of usage I noticed it had cleared some of the dark pigmentation but not in its entirely. In hopes of better results after continuous usage I kept purchasing this item; so far I've bought 5 and the armpits have not gotten any lighter since its first debut and I don't think it will. It will help, but to a limited point.

Body Odor:
None whatsoever!!! I can go to the gym and not smell anything, friends and mom have confirmed this. Until I find something better to help me with the dark armpits I will definitely keep using this bc there's never any body odor. To my shame, I have used dresses two days in a row only because there was never any odor on the armpit area.",1
"Love this shampoo. Makes my hair soft, shiny, full of body not weighed down. I have color treated hair and had trouble with breakage. This shampoo has almost completely cured that!",1
It arrived promptly. Very good quality..the same as the one I got from my dr.,1
fabulous stuff. love that Badascu,1
I like this lotion but I think the cream is what you need for really dry skin.,1
"I love this stuff but some of the other reviewers are right - do not use too much.  I have thick wavy hair to my collarbones.  I wash my hair twice a week (I color it and it is dry) and I use this ONLY after my hair is washed and is dry.  This will take all the ""fuzzy and frizzy"" out of your hair - but you need only a very little amount - use too much and your hair will be greasy in a second.  Spraying on the brush sounds like a good idea.  A minimal amount will make your hair soft and shiny and take all the frizzies out without having to get out the flat iron.  It's definitely not cheap - but one bottle will last me about 5-6 months.",1
Product was not sealed.,0
The product seems to be good and perform as represented. I had planned for this to be a Christmas gift and it arrived a week late.,1
"I love this line of skincare, so I was really wanting to try the makeup line as well, but it's almost impossible to find in a store.  It was hard ordering this online and having to guess at the color, but I ordered Almondine, and although it had a slightly more yellow base than I'm used to, it was a fairly good match.

I used it for a week, and loved the look when I first put it on, but it became a bit too oily for me (I have combination skin) and had a tendency to slide off my face as the day wore on.

Fortunately, Amazon is letting me return the unused portion for a full refund!!",0
"I ordered the Sultra Bombshell Rod Curling Iron in the hopes of trying a different method of putting curls in my niece's hair. I'm glad that I did! With a couple of practice runs, I'm now able to master Shirley Temple Curls! I will say that you will need the accompanying glove for your fingertips because the rod gets hot!",1
The product is easy to apply. I was hoping it would create more volume and with my hair it didnt. Maybe I have to much hair but it left it flat.,0
Purchased this for my bf's bday since it's his favorite cologne. Decent price & so worth it. Love this fragrance.,1
"Not a fan of this dry shampoo at all.  Perhaps it was the supplier, or a bad batch - but the product I received felt more like a full strength hairspray than a dry shampoo.  I use a number of aerosol dry shampoos such as AG, Batiste, and Redken's Pillow Proof - but Sebastian's dry clean only felt more like it's hair spray and left my hair stiff, immobile, and more grease ridden than if I hadn't used a dry shampoo at all.  I do not recommend this product, and I would not purchase it again.",0
Does not work well at all!,0
The item arrived completely empty!,0
Lip gloss was sticky.  Not a big fan of it.,0
I was very disappointed in this. For some reason this color chips the same day you put it on. I even tried using a top coat. Color I like but chippinng I don't . Won't buy this one ever again,0
"My wife likes the very long cord and the tangle-free cord spinner on the base of the iron. There are no temperature adjustments, only a simple on-off switch, which was my wife's biggest disappointment. The temperature setting is a little higher than she would normally like. The glove is not particularly heat resistant, and the hem of the glove was frayed. The wrap for storing the curling iron was also extremely cheap looking for a $130 iron. The iron itself seems to be very good quality, but because of the high heat, she wouldn't use it daily for styling, for fear of damaging her hair. But she was able to style with it well.",1
I love it!,1
Great product I live by!,1
This is an essential in my daily make up routine. The variety of colors in this palette can be as natural or dramatic as I choose ,1
Cute little palette and easy to carry anywhere. The shadow applies a lot darker than I expected but I don't mind. I use less product.,1
"I was excited since it has good reveiws and is advertised as paraben free. Unfortunately, it has methlyparaben. I know I should have read the ingredients but one would also expect the advertising to be truthful. Really disappointing.",0
"i had moderate to severe KP since i was a teen. i am in mid 20s. i was compelled to write a review for this product, though im not the one to write recommendations for anything. only those who has KP knows the feeling of inadequacy to wear shorts during the summer. after using this product for approximately a month, my skin texture greatly improved (if you want numbers, i'd say 130%). the unsightly bumps are gone about 70%. but remember i've only been using the product for the past month for about twice-three times a week. after showering with the kit, i put on the kp lotion then body butter for a better scent. try it once, you will not regret it.",1
"First there was no box, jar not sealed and the product inside is from the old type at least 1 or 2 years ago.
I have ordered this product from Elemis this past year and it comes sealed in a box and has a completely different
texture than the old style I was sent.  Very disappointed in this purchase. Not worth the money savings.",0
Conditions my hair without weighing it down or making it too greasy. I don't feel that its very good with detangling though. I have to comb my hair in the shower while the conditioner is still in my hair to get any tangles out. Ive used this for several months and have been pretty happy with it. I will buy it again.,1
This device made me feel very nervous after using it and actually gave my heart palpitations. I absolutley cannot use it again.,0
"I love Jane Iredale pressed mineral foundation.  They have a good variety of colors and have a shade I wear in Fall/Winter and into early Spring and I wear a darker shade in the Summer.  I have very sensitive skin the breaks out easily and I love that this foundation never breaks me out.  Also, you can apply lightly using a brush or can get better coverage applying with the sponge.",1
Do not buy - FAKE,0
Good product keeps hair looking good all DAY!,1
Product did not help my redness.  Bought the whole product line and used it as directed for several weeks.  Ended up on steroids to help heal my super sensitive skin.,0
"This is a functional cleansing bar.  I was surprised when I read the packaging and saw that the company specializes in men's products.  I don't know what would make this a gender-specific soap.  The lime and pomegranate fragrance is pleasant and gender neutral.  The bar is fairly heavy and rectangular, with corners that are more square than curved.

The bar receives a moderate rating from the Environmental Working Group cosmetic database, with the greatest concerns being the fragrance and the retinyl palmitate ([...]).",1
I really didn't see any change for the time I used it. My hair was hard to style after putting it on.  After trying it for a week I couldn't stand it anymore. If it wasn't so sticky maybe I would have been able to test it better.,0
"I have been using powder play for years, and this is most definitely not it. I'm not sure if it was diluted or what, but it's a different consistency, it's almost a liquid when you pour it out, it smells different and it makes my hair greasy. I have never ordered this online for fear that this would happen. Very disappointed.",0
I used this highlighter powder for when I go out. It's great for highlighting the chest area. I used it most there and a hint on my face.,1
Lotion contains Vit. E an seems to leave a slight oily film on your face. After a couple of tries had to just toss bottle out. Face was beginning to get much worse. I had this same problem with the Jack Black cleansing pads? Maybe just my face.,0
the pump stop working,1
"Perfect color for a beach vacation! It has an iridescent sheen to it to give it a ""mermaid"" look. Arrived in perfect condition. Well packaged.",1
Excelent,1
"I have had this cologne before, and it is fantastic for my taste.",0
"I just started doing my own nails after having them done in a salon for over 17 years. I had Acrylic but  decided I needed to try to save a little money - my nail tech, who has been doing my nails for 17 years, was charging me $40 every 2 weeks. My nails always looked fabulous, and I wouldn't let anyone else do my nails, she's that good, but it was time to do my own!
I read lotf of reviews about lots of Gel products and decided to try CND. I'm glad I did - it's a great product. I purchased a UV Light from Amazon and CND's Top & Base Coat, a few colors and was on my way! I used all as instructed and my nails are beautiful! I apply the gel polishes right over my own nails - and they look like they were done in a salon!
I will continue to buy this product and I would definitely recommend!",1
"I have somewhat thin, color treated, dull hair, ive tried numerous products to get that fuller hair look... Ive been using system three for about a month and a half... 1st day using this product i had a few compliments on how shiny my hair looked! Now it looks and feels fuller, it looks like more hair started growing in near the front, love the tingling sensation with the conditioner, it may come off as intense to others especially for people with sensitive skin... it works for me i was a bit sceptical when people said they had hair loss buti  have lost less hair then i was!",1
"I used other La Roche products before and I loved almost them all. Physiological Cleansing Gel became one of my favorites. I have acne prone, sensitive skin, so when I use acne products, like face wash, my skin tends to get dry and flaky. Not with PCG. My skin never felt so soft before! I am using this product with a mild acne cream and I cannot complain. It is the first time in years that my skin does not get dry while using dermatological products. If you have oily skin, it is likely this product will have to be used in combination with something else that helps to eliminate the oil.",1
My shampoo was damaged.  Can I get a replacement?,0
Has a really bad odor,0
Love that it comes off so easily but the mascara goops all at the top of the tube and wastes half of it and makes a big mess. Going back to Trish McEvoys. But glad I at least tried it.,0
Dissapointed the color is very not the color that is on the picture,0
It was a knock off product. Totally disappointed after paying 20 some dollars for it!,0
"I bought this 7 months ago. The unit no longer heats.  The power light is on, but the wand stays cold.  I have kept it in good condition and only use it a few times a week.  Very disappointed.",0
"I bought this to use with the St. Tropez ""Darker""  Mouse since it was mentioned that it was a ""must""... Well, after only one (1) use the mitt had a rip in the seam where your fingertips would touch... I could see if I was a ""newbie"" to self tanners, but after 10 yrs I believe I know the difference between a quality product & a cheap product... Shame on St. Tropez for not offering a mitt that is as exceptional as the product itself.. I read several reviews for another mitt & decided to purchase the ""Ultimitt"" by Thermalabs & WOW, what a diffence!!
Yes it's more expensive but with a 100% one year guarantee how can you go wrong?? I LOVE the ""ULTIMITT""!!! Heck, even ""Fake Bake"" provides a better mitt than the one by St. Tropez & it's included with the product for free..
I'll stick with St. Tropez for the amazing tan it provides but I'll stick with using the ""other"" mitt FOREVER!!",0
"Item looked to be new but it was already opened. Seal was broken.
It's supposed to be a gift so I have no time to return it. Got ripped off, should have bought at store",0
"Way overpriced, very disappointing. Will not buy again.",0
Returning second bottle...they've changed the formula and the smell is terrible now..moldy odor..so sad..this stuff was great. If you don't mind the stale rosemary smell on your neck it works well for sensitive skin,0
This a wonderful product!,1
"So far, I see no results whatsoever. In all fairness, maybe I need more time to see if there is any validity to correcting dark circles.",0
Got for my mom that loved the old Renac ones  but couldn't find them any more or piece back together from what she had in parts from old ones.  She loves this for the same reasons.,1
"This was not worth the money or the time, I used it as directed and it was like putting oil on.  Do not waste your money.",0
"love the scent but the cap was broken on the atomizer....a little disappointed as it was a gift, would have returned it but the recipient didn't want the hassle",1
"I have fine thin hair - so imagine my surprise when a spray gave me a HUGE head of hair. Not to be taken lightly, this stuff is incredible!!! It takes hair to new heights - literally!",1
love the product and love the price at amazon!!! it's almost twice as much at the salon i go to!!,1
"Wow I paid $38 for this and now I see it's gone up to $46?  Anyway still checking out this new formulation.  I've had it for 3 months.  It seems a little more drying than the previous version (which I LOVED LOVED, it saved my scalp!) I don't hate it and it's way more like a regular thick shampoo, the older version was watery and smelled like dog shampoo but worked great!  Will update soon.",1
My shampoo was damaged.  Can I get a replacement?,0
samples are too small for the price,0
We ordered the 9.46 ounce but received the  8.45 instead. Pretty disappointed.,0
"I don't notice any difference until I use quite a bit at which point my hair looks limp and greasy. My hair is fairly straight with some really slight wave to it. It looks normal but is actually pretty thick and settles nicely without much work but gets a bit frizzy especially on top, I hoped this would keep the frizz down but it did not. I continued my search for a styling product and I found bumble styling cream works well for me.",0
"I have very light, barely can see them, eyebrows. Hoped that this product would accentuate them and be easier to use than an eyebrow pencil. NOPE! It's hard to use and the color is not even! It's smears all over skin while applying and then just makes more work to have to wipe off where it doesn't belong. Back to the eyebrow pencil....",0
I applied one drop every two weeks and ended up making my hair fall out,0
I have tried to like this product. It makes my fine thick hair frizzy and straw like. No matter how little I use my hair feels sticky and looks like I am having a bad hair day. I like their shampoo and conditioner.,0
The mist is very fine and even so you don't get a spritz that leaves makeup ruined. That was a concern. The formula is wonderful. I used this after a chemical peel as well and it helped with the tightness and dryness.,1
"I don't know what happened, I ordered this product that I've been using for years and the packaging has changed AND the product! It is not the same, it doesn't work the same.. It's actually the worst peel I've ever used. What happened? I'm so disappointed. I will not be ordering this again",0
"arrived in time, registered with GHD no problems. Like this dryer a lot.",1
pretty color but does not  last 7 days,1
I love the refreshing mist and how dewey my skin is afterwards! Fantastic and so worth the price!,1
Great product and really helps avoid razor burn and get a really close shave.,1
"Horribly disappointed with this product, after hearing so many good reviews. No change at all for my hair.",0
"I am 33 weeks pregnant - was using this since week 12. I stopped using it around week 30 b/c I thought I had PUPP my skin was insanely itchy and was getting small hives. I started to use an anti-itch lotion. I no longer had the hive-like bumps and itch - so I started using butter again as of two days...and I got the itch and hives again! Prior to pregnancy, I had sensitive skin. So it may be my skin type vs. the butter causing irritation.",0
"A bit rough at first, then it got softer. I only use it once a week. Everyday would be too much. It has really made my dry skin so much softer.

I use it after swimming. To help get the chlorine out of my skin. Sometimes I forget to use it dry, so I use it in the shower. Its softer wet, but still  works well.

If its too rough for you at first, maybe try using a sandpaper on it to soften the bristles. I did that for a hairbrush once and it totally worked. Not sure if it would ruin these bristles...?",1
I have pretty large pores and shrinking them is my next experiment after clearing up most of my acne. I really doubted that I would find a product that would help reduce the size of them...but this really has been working. The only bad thing is that it smells really bad... that's why there is minus one star.,1
"This is good stuff ,  smells great on my face and leaves my skin clean as a whistle.",1
"The scent of Juice Beauty Stem Cellular Repair Moisturizer is the first thing I noticed. It smells like lemon Pez candies. I love the smell. Figuring out how to get to the cream took a little bit. After you remove the lid, there is a button on the top that you have to press for a while to get the cream to the top of the tub. This ensures you do not get too much and end up wasting the cream. It did take about 25 pumps the first time I used it, however, to get the cream to the top.

Very Sensitive Skin

For the purpose of this review, it's important to remember that I have a fairly common skin condition known as rosacea. For those who do not know about rosacea, there is no cure and while every person is different, the common complaints are very red skin (looks badly sunburned) that may crack or form little pimples. Blood vessels may be visible, and the skin may sting or itch. Rosacea can affect the eyes with the potential for damaging the cornea if left untreated. Some people get another form of rosacea that causes bulbous growths on the nose. Management of rosacea requires very careful attention to cleansing the skin and use of products that don't contain a lot of additives or perfumes. The medication I'm on dries the skin out, so moisturizing is essential, but my skin doesn't always like the moisturizers I try.

After reading the ingredient list, I was a little worried about how Juice Beauty's moisturizer would work with my skin. Citrus can be a bad thing. Surprisingly, it doesn't seem to be doing more than adding moisture. After a week, my skin does seem smoother and definitely less tight, so it's definitely something I'll recommend if you don't mind spending the money.",1
"Not only does this not go on clear as advertised, it's a chalky mess on my underarms.  White flaking and messy, certainly not as advertised.  Buyer beware.  I would not recommend this deodorant at all.  It also leave stains on clothing.",0
"I have used it couple times so far, I like it. My hair is very curly and after I finished straightend it with the Chi flat iron and this product I can not believe it is my hair. My daughters loved it too.",1
same product sold by my dermatologist,1
Love Bliss products although I do find them a bit pricey.,1
"Delivery was fast. 1st tube was water, like the components had separated. Retuning is easy. 2nd tube also watery. Will be returning product for credit. Super bummed that this is happening!",0
"I decided to try this product based on my salon experience.  It is as advertised, works very well and I would order it again.",1
Wonderful product!,1
HAVE TO TRY IT .,1
This product definitely gives you volume and texture. I wish it had a nice scent but besides that it does what it says.,1
Makes for a perfect shave,1
"I just used this product for couple days and right now area around eyes swelling, burning and red , some ingredient in the that cream I am allergic too. And I been used before other companies but never have like this allergic reaction ever.",0
"Ventured away from standard store bought body washes to try this out. I liked it, but ultimately can't justify the cost. I have sensitive skin and found that this was gentle enough to use.",1
"I have watery eyes and have been trying lots of different brands over the years... this one works and has amazing staying power! I've tried Urban Decay, Laura Mercier, and many others. This liner is a winner! Color stays put and bold all day.",1
"I have only used it for about 3 weeks, but using it faithfully...I can see some growth to my nails and they are seem stronger. I am very happy with this product!",1
The result is not natural looking. Not sure what it does other than make my polish thicker.,0
"Gotta say I read what the scent was and I was quite excited, but when I got it and smelled it... whoa man that was bad. I still shaved with it in case it was one that need to break in and see if the lather and post shave feel where there (those were I will say). That smell was just to much to get passed. Going to try the Green (menthol) and Red (sandalwood) here at some point.",0
"Not for me...unlike face make-up for women that matches their skin tone, Toppik is problematic as you are literally throwing a fine dark powder on you scalp. Once on, it looks OK but touch your hair and you are immediately covered in dirt. If you are planning to not touch your hair or be anywhere near other humans with good eye-sight and do not care if it's obvious that you are masking your balding head with dark powder then this is fine.",0
"brand new as description, love the price!",1
I bought this palette in hopes of finding a better shadow than I was using.  That was not the case. It irritated my eyes everytime I put it on and the irritation lasted for several days. I change foundation at the same time so it took me a little time to figure out the shadow was causing the irritation. I also had problems with it creasing. Don't recommend this product.,0
"I would describe my skin as super pale.  I live in Florida, and I wear this every single day.  Goes on like silk, doesn't smell like anything, and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.  It also doesn't slide right off my face (and into my eyes) during sports/athletic activities. It's expensive, but worth it when it comes to making sure I maintain the illusion of being 15 years younger than I am, and having perfect skin without make-up. With daily use, a bottle generally lasts me 2-3 months.",1
Thanks!,1
"Great addition to any bubble bath.  Makes a relaxing scent that stays on your body after you leave the tub.  When applying oil or fragrance to you body, it does not clash or intrude, rather it seems to make other scents bounce more.  I would recommend this to those who like to relax in the tub.",1
"Hate it! First of all the product was used and taped back! The iron does not heat up, not even at the highest temp. Im returning it.. Im really disappointed with this curler",0
Such a wonderful smelling little luxury! Long lasting and mild scent! I love that it doesn't have a strong perfume or heavy smell. Scents our home wonderfully. 4 stars because it's pricy!!,1
I would love it a lot more if the pump top actually worked on mine. The color was great though.,1
The formula is so dark that it stains towels when drying your hair.,0
"I purchased this product when I read a review on Amazon.com.  Well, I do not find it as amazing as the reviewer did.  I hardly use it now.  I love the Butter London products, but this is not my favorite.",0
Of all the shaving cream/foam that I have tried this is hands down my favorite.,1
Save your money. This didn't curl my eyelashes very well. I use curl my eyelashes and put on WATERPROOF mascara before-hand and I can BARELY tell a difference. Product feels very cheaply made as well. You would think with a price like this that you would get a well-made product that works well.,0
darker color than shown on website -not for me,0
All this did was make my scalp look very dirty with the smudges it left. Washed it out right away and would never use it again.,0
Dries polish fast.,1
Best product ever!! Just look at the pics I posted and you will know all you need to know. After I dry my hair it takes me all of 30 seconds to disperse this product onto my scalp and head out the door. I had been wearing wigs until I found this product. I live in Florida and wigs are HOT in the summer so this product was a real blessing for me. I use the dark brown and I do use the applicator that is sold separately.,1
"Not the color cover I was looking for, the color is to light !",1
"So the product changed from when I first put it in my shopping cart and when I actually purchased it (yah I like to think about things for a while) and what I got was different from what I expected. The box was torn open, but careful inspection showed the product had not been sampled. It's a good product, and I'm happy with it, just was not what I thought I ordered, which was an unscented lip balm (got it free on IcelandAir and absolutely love that version). Not worth returning.",1
"Though 10 hours is NOT my experience for how long it stays, it does go on smoothly and works as well as my typical kohl.  It is a bit odd to need to sharpen what looks like plastic, as I'd typically expect some sort of advancing mechanism.  The pigment itself is quite soft, so sharpening is more challenging than I consider ideal.  Good color, easy application, doesn't last all day.  So, not bad but not perfect.",1
Came with a seal broken . Takes awhile to take nail polish off .,0
love the smell,1
"I purchased this product from Ulta along with Abba Moisture Shampoo to see which one works more effectively for dandruff and sensitive scalps. I have very sensitive skin and have found it difficult to find a product that reduces dandruff but is also good for people with sensitive skin. Unfortunately this product did not work. After trying this product, my entire scalp began and itch and it actually dried it out making my scalp have more flakes. Not a good product for people with sensitive skin.",0
"does not run, easy to apply. love this black liquid eyeliner.",1
Perfect nude color,1
Amazing smell! Not greasy.,1
this really hydrates my flaky patches all day!!,1
"I saw this bar in a magazine (I think it was InStyle) and ordered it on good faith, thinking that if it was not a good purchase, Amazon's return policy makes things pretty simple.

I've only been using this for 3 days but I can now see a serious improvement in my skin -- it looks more even and my pores have shrunk considerably. I'm using it with a charcoal-infused konjac sponge, you can find these on Amazon as well. I was seriously worried about paying $45 for what is essentially a bar of soap, but from the looks of it, it should last me 6 months with one daily wash a day. I don't recommend using it more than once per day as it may irritate your skin. Also, be careful when using it after waxing -- give your skin a day before using it after a face wax.",1
"This stuff covers great, and the ingredients are good.  My only issues is my skin is too dark for opal and too pale for nude - have to combine the two, which gets annoying.  But it does offer excellent coverage and does stay put for the work day (and I have exceptionally oily skin).",1
Very weak. Doesn't say on long.,0
"This is not the real product.  I was very disappointed to realize that the product inside the bottle was not the original gel.  The packaging seems legitimate and it was obviously sealed.  However, the real gel is pinkish in color and has a very pleasant smell.  The product inside this container was yellow in color with an unpleasant smell.  Beware that you are not getting the real product.",0
Does not cover at all!!!,0
Best nude lip ever!  A true nude!,1
Very good,1
I was surprised how lemony it is-It seems to dry my skin.  Im going to give it away.,0
"i bought this product before from amazon & it was AWESOME.
i just ordered another one since mine was about to finish. & to my surprise its so different than the first one. its so GREASY like.
& its weighing the hair down like u just put baby oil on it. Disappointed as i really liked the first one.
maybe this was a defective one. but definitely not the agadir argan oil!!",0
This was disappointing.  It was not waterproof.,0
"Good product but extremelly small presentation, quite expensive for the amount of conditioner",0
Does not give you a close shave and rough on skin...this item is NOT returnable...so save your money!!,0
Great color it is actually a bright tangerine orange love it. Orange is one of my favorite colors and will definitely order more.,1
"Love this stuff, fully develops a natural looking bronze tan in about an hour. The brown color of the foam makes it easy to see missed spots, the smell isn't as bad as most of the other self tanners out there. Leaves skin really soft afterwords. Just make sure you wash your hands immediately after you are done or wear gloves because it stains hand pretty instantly",1
"I absolutely LOVE this toothpaste. I have the Ginger Mint and the Lavender, and let me tell you, if you want to impress guests, you want this. Trust me. I have had multiple visitors say it was the best toothpaste they have ever used. The taste is understated and not too intense which I love. The toothpaste works into a great lather and really tastes like Ginger :) As a  guy, I keep it in the guest bathroom and everybody wants to know where I got it. If you are worried about price, please, please just take the plunge. You will be glad you did, and I have no plans to buy any other brand of toothpaste. I would also recommend the cinnamon one. Tastes so great it is tempting to swallow. If you pair this with a Sonicare, your teeth win. They just win, and it is great for impressing girls that come over :)
Unless you make minimum wage, buy this toothpaste and you will be extra glad you did. I cannot say anything bad about it, except of course for the price. Thank you for reading my review and as always, good luck!",1
"Horrible! $30.00 for the 3 polishes. Regular nail polish works the same. Not worth the price. I deserve a refund, OPI. You suckered me.",0
I'm a huge Essie fan and loved this color in the salon. Bought on Amazon and it was goopy and not the quality I've learned to expect. Something was off.,0
"This is my second bottle of this stuff. Im hooked. It smells amazing but its also my hair holy grail. When im in a hurry I just rub some of this in my hair and it looks healthy, shiny and less out of control. It doesnt have allot of hold like a styling gel/mouse/spray but it has a little. My boyfriend just started using it too...even he loves it.",1
I do not recommend this for face unless you are going to the beach and wearing no face make up. It is too thick to wear under your daily foundation. Otherwise it is great for body. Has no obnoxious scent and works.,1
I bought this item November 1st from Amazon and on November 29th the plastic around the head broke and it's useless.  The time has expired to return on Amazon.  What a waste of $325.00,0
"I think my skin is too sallow for this product as it makes me appear slightly jaundiced (not a good look!).  It's a nice smooth cream which glides on nicely, but definitely not for the sallow of skin.",0
"I really wanted to like this and I tried several times. This iron gets DANGEROUSLY hot, even the tip doesn't stay cool. I burned myself each time no matter how careful I was. It only took one time for me to get the hang of the controls but the temp would fluctuate & sometimes would not budge above 350%. This iron does curl quickly & the curl does hold so I'm disappointed about the heat. I cannot recommend this iron.",0
"Dermablend came recommended as a brand by a friend of mine who's best friends with a drag queen. Not quite a year into transition and I'm still learning how to do makeup, and since I'm relatively dark for a white person, five o'clock shadow is a constant annoyance.

I've been using this with a Cover Girl BB cream (the oil-control kind) and some MAC Fix+ spray and, well, it works fine. I do feel that for the price, it's far too expensive for me to be carrying around in my purse, which means it simply isn't available for me later on after I've been eating food, wiping my face, blowing my nose, etc. so the odds are that I won't rebuy it, simply because of the cost alone. But it would be great for a date night look or a photo shoot (yeah, right, at my age and weight?).",1
"I have sensitive, thick skin which has been problematic over the years. I like how my face feels after I use this wash. A word of caution...use light pressure and make sure your face and hands are wet before scrubbing.",1
Smells terrible. Conditioner does not work.,0
way too drying,0
This is a beautiful pink lipstick.  Love it.  It is not dark and it has a slight shimmer to it.  Looks great day or night.  Thanks Amazon.  Pinkpup.,1
"I have the opposite problem as everyone else with the color.
I have been using this color at my local nail salon for over a year and was used to it being mint.
I saw people buying it from here had received a mint color.
Mine is actually the light green seen in the product photos.
I included a photo of both colors I have seen this color turn out as.
It'd be nice if I could purchase this color and have it be consistently either light green or mint.",0
"Skin feels good, no change in neck...still sags",0
"As a hairstylist, I've had & used this iron before & ordered a new one. Iron came in quickly but plates don't touch flat when closing without forcing & temp doesn't get hot enough.",0
The CND shellac system is great. The big downfall when purchasing online is that the color of the bottle is it always reflective of what's inside the bottle.,0
Best detangler and leave in conditioner ever! Worth the price. Works instantly - love it!!,1
I purchased this 3 years ago and it just died. I only use a few times a year so I am bummed it didn't last longer. First the plastic piece that you squeeze to open the iron popped off about a year ago. I had to use a heat glove just to be able to use it. Now it won't stay on and shorts out every few seconds. I won't be buying another as the quality isn't worth it.,0
I bought this product and used it twice.  Now it will not turn on.  After receiving the BaByliss hairdryer (which I love) this is very disappointing!,0
Ultra Rich is a good name for this Shampoo. Lather twice and its even better.,1
"I love the color; but I'm sorry, like other reviewers, the tip kept breaking off. I'm disappointed and I wish it would have worked for me.",0
The color was much darker,0
I really needed the Clarifying version.,1
"With most thickening shampoos I expect a bit of tingle to help stimulate the scalp that was missing from this shampoo.  Nice fragrance, cleans hair well but didn't really notice much of a difference in the hair after a week of use.  After trying Aveda's Invati, this product, Billy Jealousy and probably some others the Aveda gave the healthiest-looking results and will probably be the one we return to.",1
This product burned my skin and left it red and crusty. Be careful if your skin is sensitive as mine is. And I used only a little dab as instructed.,0
This is a nice base coat. Makes color polish last longer and protects natural nails. A must have for healthy nails if you use polish.,1
Love the color,1
"Love this iron, at first it pulled on my hair, but after a few weeks of use it glides beautifully. Gets hot fast, and has an 8 ft cord",1
The smell is not as intense as the one I tested in the store. It just goes away in a few minutes. The product smells like it has been diluted from its original.,0
Works well for a hint of color. Color leaves hair quickly after stopping product.  Have used several different times.,1
Love how think this polish is...great color in one swipe (2 is even better).,1
"Currently my face is much tanner than it usually is at this time of year  because of such hot weather we have had , I am very tanned and my med. Beige Time Balm foundation was too white and  I couldn't find a color that would match so what I do is use both colors and it works wonderfully. It is easy to apply and I use a foundation brush and mix both colors and it works out fine.",1
good quality just one thing heavy must be use by men.,1
"lovely.  Haven't used it many times,yet.",1
"I purchased this from Q**.  This really works.  I've been using this for about a month and I am already seeing results.  I use this on my face and I've already increased to level 2.  In the owners manual it says to activate this either by a phone number or by going on the Tria website.  If you don't activate the Tria first before using it, the Tria won't work.  This is a keeper!!!

I am re-doing my review on this.  Just recently I returned this to Q**.  After using it for the past few months I started to get a reaction to the Tria Calming Gel.  The calming gel caused my face to burn and get flakey and dry.  Also the Tria would hurt every time I used it and after a few months of using it, the Tria would cut out on me during use.  Q** refunded the tria.  I have got back to epilating.",0
"This is advertised as an After Shave Lotion, but it's far more of a splash.",1
"""Decent"" detangler....smell is great!",1
The curling iron was for my wife and she really likes it. The price was really below value of this curling iron.,1
Color is not as expected. Looks like a faded brown. It just looks to faded/ muted.,0
Thiis product is like magic.  I recommend it for women and men.  But don't forget to also order the Toppik holding spray to hold it in.  It should be sold with the item because you can not do one without the other.,1
"After 2 years this is dead, motor burned out.  I dry my hear about 2x a week, and not at all  in the summer.  Waste of big money, not worth the shipping or cost to repair, since it was never great to begin with.",0
Takes off makeup quickly and easily. Will buy again.,1
"it is a good product and I got fast shipping, thank you!",1
Fragrance is too masculine for me.,0
Very good.,1
"Did not want it, it came with another product I bought and they charged me",0
While I did like how this tinted moisturizer went on and how it lasted through the day it ultimately made my skin breakout. I know the tinted moisturizer is to blame because it was the only skin care item I had recently changed. I've always had sensitive skin but I was really hoping this would work. It has light to medium coverage. My skin was a little greasy by the end of the day but not too bad overall. Give this a try if your skin doesn't easily breakout.,0
found it easy to use.and very good results.  will continue to use.  saving money by not going to a shop.,1
"I had used these products before when I get a hair cut. The salon uses this product line all the time. I was excited to buy this expensive shampoo and finally use it in my own home. First time I used it, it did not perform like the same product at the salon. My hair was noticably dryer after using the ones I bought. I confirmed my suspicion when I went for another haircut and the product they used left my hair feeling healthy. I suspect these are either fake or an expired batch, either way they not worth the very expensive price tag",0
"I love this, my sides are really bad.only bad thing is it looks dull after a while. But i still love it!! Its fixable",1
A++++++++++,1
Don't waste your money.,0
"The 8.8 oz. milk soap is a big bar and will last a very long time. i was lucky enough to have a soap dish to fit it. It is important to make sure to drain the water off of the dish so the soap can dry when it's not in use. This is a very nice soap that lathers well and rinses off easily. I have not had any problem with soap scum in the bath tub, either, which is a nice plus. Everyone in my family uses it, and I think my hubby has been swiping it and using it with his shaving brush. Not sure how that worked out for him, though. Anyway, we've been using it for about two months and it doesn't look any smaller. Maybe my eyes are playing tricks, it's a magical soap, or it was just so big to begin with that I haven't noticed it decreasing in size. :)

I purchased this at drugstore.com along with a few other items and got free shipping with $25 purchase.",1
"oribe products are worth every penny. this wonderful stuff provides both texture and volume. most of my hair is thick, but as i've aged i was mortified to see that one side had markedly thinned. the thinning also showed up at the hairline above my forehead. oribe hair care dry texturizing spray is the only product i've used that truly helps reinforce some fullness to those areas in dire need of exactly that. a little goes a long way, and the incredible scent is intoxicating. because oribe products are high-end haircare, they are exclusive to a limited number of salons and department stores. unless one lives in or near a large city, oribe products may be purchased only online. so you, amazon customer, are in luck. don't squander that good fortune. order oribe hair care dry texturing spray today. you can thank me later.",1
"Love Love Love this spray! My hair stylist turned me onto this, and it is great! It is worth every penny for super sexy hair! I think if someone has had a bad experience they should ask their stylist what they are doing wrong. This is super easy to use, and makes hair gorgeous!",1
"The product is very irritating,  the first time I used, I can feel the the burning pain on the face ,.I can't use it , and I do not know how to deal with it.",0
"I loved this product when I first received it.  It took a long while to need to be recharged, and when I did, I found out the charger did not work.  I am past the return window and now stuck with an expensive product that does not work.",0
I bought a shade too dark,1
I love this stuff. Keeps my frizzy hair smooth and silky.,1
"I loved this product. I have my mother's large-pore combination sensitive Irish skin. It never looks super-clear because of the oil but -BONUS- it ages so slowly that the ladies in our family look awesome through their fifties. For years, I've used mud masks from Borghese and Aveda to clear pores.

This powder functioned like a MUCH stronger mud mask. Even stronger than ProActiv's spot mask. Stronger not in irritation but in drying effect. It dried so much that it flaked on my clothing near the end of it's drying period. Know that if you're wearing black. This said, I appreciated the strength of it for my T-zone. I wouldn't use it on the whole face, but it would be fantastic for teenagers in the super-oily stage or anyone going through a hormonal change that's blocked up their skin.

I'd also like to put in an unsolicited plug for virgin raw coconut oil for use as a moisturizer by all skin types. It's anti-bacterial and has a soothing effect on my super-sensitive skin, even when it's oily already.",1
"I like the product, but HATE the packaging.  It is a daily problem.  I have actually cut myself on the sharp edges of the top.  I will not buy this again simply because of the packaging.",0
It's alright,0
"I have had this product for sometime, but I have not been using it as frequently as I should but so far I have had no problems. My daughter has even used it to help with breakouts. All I can say is so far so good. For me it is cheaper and nicer to use this machine in the privacy of my home rather then going somewhere.",1
It's good.,1
"I wish I would have found this product years ago! Living in Florida and California, I have, in the last 7 years or so developed some freckles and discoloration on my cheeks and forehead. One spot in particular in my cheek has become darker and larger over the years, most people have thought it to be a birthmark. I notice it in photos and even have to use concealer to cover it up. I have had to have microdermabrasion to lighten it to no avail. I just started seeing a new facialist whom recommended this product to me when I asked for microderm on the areas. I would have done anything for these results but I did my research and bought from amazon. I started applying it religiously on the affected areas and I can now (after 3 weeks) honestly tell you that the spot is gone!!!! I does burn at first, you do have to use it everyday, and it did cause the area to scab and peel. I applied it to my whole forehead and also dabbed qtip in the spots at night.

My skin is now spot free! Love this product!",1
"The seller did everything right, no hard feelings there. I am just not impressed with the product. I have tried the organix drugstore brand in the past and that is what this reminds me of! I was hoping for something more like the Morrocan Oil or macadamia oil- but this is thick and silicone feeling and feels very fake for such a ""natural"" description. If I am not careful and apply it mostly to the ends first I will end up with greasy looking hair.",0
I recently bought my Hot tools curler and i love it alot!!! I can set the heat setting to the temperature that i want and it all depends on i want my hair to be curly. Great tool if you are looking for to create those loose curls.,1
Works very well... much better that anything I have tried before.,1
"I've used this product every morning and evening since the middle of May and I have not seen any improvements in my skin. This is very disappointing, I expect great results or at least a reasonable improvement but I see none.",0
"I only got one use out of it.  Thought I would at least get 3, but only one pumps and it was empty. Don't waste your money",0
"I thought it was just mint flavored or a little peppermint.  No it actually burned my lips worse than the hives it was supposed to fix.  Maybe in any other mixture it might be fin?.  But if you have dry cracked lips they will be in more pain that before.  I am in agony and on my 5th week now.  I was 2 weeks into my ordeal and now 3 weeks later I am still dealing with the effects of this stuff  I am still burned and my lips are still cracked,  oozzing fluid and blistered.  I am in 100 times the agony I was with the hives.  I have not ever run into a product this bad and that has caused such serious damage.  I haven't even gotten to the point of knowing where this end in layers of damage.  Not ever in 42 years have I run into a product that has hurt me this bad.",0
"Real, original Paul Mitchell product. Great shampoo that solves my scalp dryness.",1
This smells like mens cologne. I thought it would smell more feminine disappointed.,0
"I received this in my Boxycharm March box. I love trying higher end mascaras but this one was disappointing. It gives you the ""butterfly"" effect lashes, similar to Better Than Sex or Loreal Lash Paradise... But not as good. My lashes aren't as dark and it doesn't seem to add any length. As a reference some of my favorites mascaras are: Tarte Tarteist, Supersizer, IT cosmetics Superhero. Honestly, a drugstore mascara would do a better job.",0
"The product is like a sampler, & such high price. I tried it and you can get the same result with Over the counter $3.00 product. I don't know the comments that they said it is so great and my hair is much thicker. I think they didn't check out the products that are easy available. I spent $33.00 dollars for 2 ounces of each shampoo, conditioner & hair setting lotion and did not see the different. It is a rip off.",0
This product was recommended by my doctor.,1
"Honestly, this is a miracle product. I have been dying and blow-drying and being a general jerk to my hair for many years. I faithfully use this once a week and every time I do it feels like my hair is years younger and incredibly healthy. Can't say enough about this stuff!",1
I think my eyes are oily and after a long day it sometimes flakes,1
"After several weeks of using as directed 3 times a week, I have noticed absolutely zero effect. I have normal skin and I was not looking for a miracle, but a nice mask to give me that ""just had a mini-facial"" feel at home.  My skin does not look or feel any different right after application, nor have I seen any changes to my skin after several weeks of use.  As a mask/peel, it does not work for me. I read an interview of Tammy Fender in which she claims to use this as a daily scrub with her Clarasonic brush.  That bothers me greatly, as that is not how she directs her customers to use this product (""yes, I know I said clap your hands, but it works better if you stomp your feet!""); however, I have been using it this way for the past week and I have not seen/felt any difference, either.  As a scrub/exfolient it does not work either.  For $80, I could have had a real spa facial.",0
"Have bought this product in store before and this product is fake. It's not the right color or smell, it actually smells faintly of gasoline. My skin had an immediate bad reaction to it.",0
"I am really really really happy with this.  I'm a new  Jane Iredale user,  I use the mineral bb cream #7 and I Jay wanted to test out her other products. One thing that really surprised me about this is the smell, it smells amazing and delicious,  no taste but smells so sweet that it concerned me about added fragrances so I researched it and there is no added fragrances,  the great smell comes from the natural ingredients! I'm really impressed.  Thank you to Jane Iredale for a great product. I'll definitely purchase the full size products.",1
I bought this as a gift for my fianc for Christmas. She has always used Chi but was told great things about this product so I decided to get it for her. After a week of using it she told me it doesn't straighten her hair near as well as a Chi and went back to her Chi.,0
"Long time user of the Billy Jealousy Hydroplane shave cream.  However, the new formula for Hydroplane shaving cream is not as good as the original formula.  The new version has a flowery smell, has the consistency of lotion rather than a shaving cream, and now leaves me with razor burns/skin irritation when I shave with it.  The customer service rep. at Billy Jealousy admitted that they changed the formula and that other customers have provided similar negative feedback on this new formula Hydroplane.  I will not purchase, again, unless they go back to the old formula.",0
I have Betty lou Andy Mary lou and I'm telling you this is absolutely FAKE the box is cheap made and light while the original are heavy and better quality. The hilighter itself chunky as hell I rubbed my finger for 5 sec on Betty and Mary and nothing happened now I did the same on Cindy omg it was a disaster do not waste your money,0
"I don't usually leave reviews, but this bottle of Chrome was an absolute waste of money. It is FAKE! DO NOT BUY!!!!! YOU CAN'T RETURN IT!",0
"I have never received so many comments about how good u smell as I have wearing this cologne and the lotion of the same fragrance. One of the most frequent comments I hear is ""God you smell good.""  Even the guys at the car wash comment. I don't wear any other scent, of course. Please never discontinue this fragrance and the lotion. If you do let me know so I can purchase your remaining stock!",1
"After I read that this was the #1 sunscreen in Consumer Reports, after I read all the glowing reviews, and after convincing myself that sometimes you have to spend more to get the best, I finally bought a tube of this...and I was thoroughly unimpressed. The texture is thick and sticky and did not ""melt in"" at all, as one would expect from both the name and the gushing praise from CR. With a name like ""milk"" and a descriptor like ""melt-in"" and the gushing reviews from CR that said it left behind a ""velvety"" finish, you'd expect a product with a thinner consistency that completely disappears. You'd be wrong. It is absolutely not worth the price. I took it back and bought another tube of Face Factor by Kiss My Face for one-quarter of the price.",0
"This sunscreen has been a solid performer for me. It applies smoothly, with just a little rubbing to get it fully absorbed. Unlike other broad-spectrum sunscreen lotions, this product does not leave your skin feeling tacky or sticky, even when you are applying it.

Once on my face, this lotion stays put, even on hot, humid days when I am doing yardwork or hiking, with beads of perspiration on my face. I have used other sunscreens supposedly for the face that break down with perspiration and get into my eyes  ouch! This lotion has not done that to me.

When following the simple directions of applying it 15 minutes before going into the sun and putting on a fresh coat every 1.5 to 2 hours, this sunscreen has protected me from any sign of burning. As part of testing it, I also placed a dot the size of a quarter on one of my legs and that area gained less color than the surrounding skin, which I had coated with a different sunscreen with a lower SPF.

Unfortunately, if you are sensitive to fragrance, this product does have the usual slightly sour bite that most sunscreens have, but it is less strong than most brands I have tried. As for the retail price, it is quite steep, but it does provide the added value of protecting against both UVA and UVB at a high SPF rating of 60. Also of value is the fact that it resists breaking down when you sweat, which protects your face from burning, and your eyes from unwanted sunscreen. For me, even when traveling, the benefits outweigh the hassle and cost of having a supply of face sunscreen and another of body sunscreen.",1
"As a professional cosmetologist I would never recommend buying salon brand items off the internet, they cannot guaranteed by the manufacturer unless sold from a salon or cosmetology school. So you are probably buying a knock off, if that does not bother you than be my guest.",0
Did not apply to nail well at all. Was very thick and air bubbles would appear on the nail. You need to work fast and cannot do back and do more than one brushstroke to spread out across nail evenly. Do not buy. I use the polishes without the top coat and they last just as well.,0
it works some,1
A British friend gave me hers - it's so good I went hunting for another...and my nails are actually growing!,1
"This concealer comes in a container that looks and feels like a lipstick container. You use it in the same way. I think that is nice because you could easily carry it with you in your purse.

I've found it easy to use and effective. I use it to cover up some ""age spots"" and blotches. I've used it with and without foundation and it works with either. It isn't super creamy so you do need to blend it in a bit. I have fairly light skin but it has blended in well -- doesn't look too light or too dark or ""articifial.""

My experience has been that is lasts for the bulk of the day. If I apply it in the morning, I don't need to reapply throughout the day.

If you're looking for a compact, easy to carry concealer that works well, this would be a good choice and worth trying. As with any make-up product, I think your results will vary depending on your skin tone and condition.",1
Didn't stay put on water line,0
Love this product. Makes your hair feel soft and manageable. Takes that frizz away in an instance. You will love it.,1
"In my continuing quest to find the perfect shampoo/conditioner combo, I thought I would give Blow Pro a try.  I so wanted to be a Blow Pro Girl.  While the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blow-Pro-Blow-Up-Daily-Volumizing-Shampoo-8-0-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B007192MUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blow Pro Blow Up Daily Volumizing Shampoo, 8.0 Fluid Ounce</a>&nbsp;is not so bad, the conditioner just spoils it.  It leaves hair tangled and matted and requires the use of a leave-in conditioner.  This is a waste of money.",0
this stuff works great. the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because it does not smell very good and it's a little hard to rub in. but my 2 year old has not had any burns since using this. also i think it's a bit pricey.,1
"Yep, all the positive reviewers are right! This night cream is amazing. Everything you expect on a night cream, and it does not leave your skin ""heavy"" in the morning.",1
"This works well for a face cleansing system.  I am not 100% sold on the anti-aging massager.  I will have to use it for much longer, to give a good assessment on that part of it, but for the little time I have been using it, I have not noticed any difference.  I like that there aren't any replacement brush heads, like with other cleanser systems, you are constantly spending more money to buy the replacement brush heads.  And the brush heads aren't usually that cheap.  It works well as a cleanser, so I am satisfied there.",1
"This is a gorgeous bright, bold, vibrant color.  It's going to be a popular color, this summer.  It will look great with or without a tan!",1
"Cologne pictured was not what I received.
I am a Burberry Brit girl and was a little disappointed.",0
"I was unable to use the gel primer - kept having scaly skin on my forehead.  Once I switched to the crme primer, the itching and scaliness went away.",1
Used the lip gloss for a few days and made my lips sore they started to peel and hurt so bad... idk if it is the product of if I just have sensitive skin... hope this helps,0
"I bought this after reading so much about how it helps wrinkles and how Oprah's beauty editor uses it. So far, so good! I can see a slight improvement already. It stings a bit when putting it on but that goes away after a few seconds. I use it every other night, the other nights I use the Retin-A prescription Tretinoin cream.",1
"Has a sticky feeling, does not even make your lips soft",0
"I bought this product specifically because it was for brunette hair, thinking that it wouldn't leave a lighter residue at the roots. I was wrong. I have light brown hair and it left my roots looking almost gray. Other than that, the smell was pleasant and it worked as it should. I just wouldn't spend the extra money for the brunette tint because it doesn't deliver the desired results.",0
ceramic coating began to peel off after one month!  I returned this one and stuck with the gold plating - much better!,0
Works extremely well with a small learning curve. Id say adds a bit of class to shaving.,1
Takes time to dry hair completely. But it seems does little harm to air. Good for everyday use. like it.,1
"I never write reviews. I decided to do this for all the gals out there looking for a miracle. First of all, I am smarter than this so I feel really silly. If this really worked, it would be impossible to get and cost a fortune. My belly is pretty much flat just needed the tiniest bit of help after baby 2. I saw absolutely no difference. Save your $$ and drink some extra water and put down the bread. I promise it's more effective and I'm not getting paid like Cosmo mag!!!",0
Its just a color its not thickener at all,0
"My hairdresser turned me on to this product - I have thin, dense hair, and if it's even a little bit humid out, blow drying is usually a waste of time.  This product seems to give me a smoother result - even when I'm doing the blow drying instead of my hairdresser - and my hair seems to keep its shape better even in wet weather.  I've been using it about a month now.",1
Not as good as the cream.  Does not foam and suds up as well.  Very thin with less lubrication.,0
Perfect for winter skin!  Love it!!,1
The rose essence really comes through.,1
"I've used many products from devines,and I've been happy with everything I've bought,with the exception of this hair shield ,its very over drying,sticky and when. I've used this product bc if the alcohol in this product it burned.my hair!! So my conusion is to not buy.this.product",0
the cap is broken,0
"I use this as a second or third coat to add a little sparkle on colors that may be a little dull for summer.  Really looks pretty.  Would not probably use it alone, but haven""t tried it.  As always love the shellac product line.",1
"It does seem to work. At first, I apply twice a day for about two weeks, and that seems to get in under control. Then I move to once a day then every other day at about a month to maintain. However, it does make me cough as well (another reviewer mentioned that). I have to cover my face with a towel when I apply it, then run out of the room. It can't be good to get this stuff into your lungs! Another complaint: it has gotten pricy over the years. I ordered this in June 2015, and it was $28 back then. Now it's listed for $42 for the same 8oz size.",1
"I've used a number different Zirh products and scents. This one is my co-favorite (along with the Clean face wash). It's not scented, so if you are buying it to splash on for the scent, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a smooth, soothing, lightweight, alcohol-free, non-oily post-shave balm to leaves your face baby-soft and refreshed, this is a fantastic choice. I follow up with a SPF moisturizer, because years of fun in the sun will show up on your face. A little goes a long way- my last bottle lasted me over a year! Highly recommeded.",1
I cant give this a 5 stars because the packaging was so horrible! The box it came in was crushed and dirty like it was slid across a dirty floor alot. But the actual product was fine sealed and i have absolutely loved. I have fair skin and it has given me a brighter healthier look. I'll be buying more when this runs out but maybe not from this seller.,1
"I really didn't expect a whole lot from it, but, I figured I would give it a try, since it's received such rave reviews.

I HATE those nasty, unexpected... unwelcome suckers that pop up out of nowhere when you least expect them! This stuff seriously kills them overnight. I mean, it doesn't eliminate their presence entirely, but it literally prevents them from ever getting to the ""whitehead"" stage and reduces them to a pathetic excuse of what they'd ever hoped to be.

When I feel/see one brewing, I will slap some of this on it before I go to bed - when I wake up and wash my face, that which felt like an iceberg that would have a big nasty head on it upon waking (at least one) has been reduced to a little pink dot or bump with no whitehead whatsoever!  Then it just heals like a normal zit would once it got past it's glory days.

It just helps you skip over that few days of squeezing and being aggravated and possibly scarring. It's pretty awesome!

No clue how it works, but it DOES work!",1
Great smell.,1
"This product lets me air dry my hair without that crunchy feel. It's great for the shorter bob styles - have to see how it will handle the ""grow out"" phase.  Highly recommend",1
"Not as useful as I thought, Not as useful as I thought, I thought that would be a recognized brand to excellent, but I was wrong ... It really does not meet my expectations",0
This didn't work very well,0
"I identify as black American, with curly natural hair. This product seemed to sit on top of my hair, slick and gummy. Made curls look stringy. Not for me.",0
"First let me say that I LOVE Lanza products and have been using them for over 10 years - specifically their thickening shampoo and conditioner and their Lanza Healing Volume Daily Thickening Treatment and have always been pleased with the results (I have crazy fine hair and not a lot of it.)

When searching to repurchase the thickening treatment I came across this zero weight gel and went on to read that many people felt that it gave their fine hair terrific volume so I thought I would give it a try.  For whatever reason - it did the exact opposite for me.  My hair had no volume/fullness after blow drying and I was actually embarrassed by how limp it seemed.  I gave it two tries but the same thing happened on the second time.

The good news is that I gave the product to my sister; she has thinning hair that is wiry, dry and coarse and this product did magic on her hair.  Lots of beautiful volume - she loves it!",0

"I have been using fusion for a while and thought what a great idea to have an applicator for even distribution and making it last.  A totally frustrating experience and a waste of money.  It blobs out in a puff - the ball stays down if you pump too hard or too long - you can't control where the dust is flying.  So much easier to just sprinkle and the coverage is better by far.  Total waste of time, effort and money~",0
my wife loves this curling iron,1
"I have very fine curly hair, this was just to heavy, no bounce to my curls, tried using less than recommend no difference.",0
"My eyelashes are longer and darker.  When I have no mascara on, you can still see my previously invisible lashes.",1
"I'm so sad! I love this product, but received one with a faulty nozzle -- so it doesn't work. And it's not eligible for return.
What a waste...",0
"A product you need to try and see how it works with your skin.  Seems to work well for my kids, but is just one part of the plan.",1
The product came in early and I really enjoy this product,1
Came on time and is exactly what we expected. Yummy smell. We really love it. Thanks for getting it to us quickly.,1
"Love this stuff! I have used this in combination with the charcoal cleanser and I swear it has changed my skin for the better. My pores are smaller, my skin looks and feels cleaner and clearer. I never had an issue with acne but my pores being larger was an issue for me. It's REALLY helped with oil production and it's evened out my skin tone.  Love this stuff, will definitely re-order when I run out.",1
I feel like I wasted my money.. My lips never felt nourished or hydrated. :(. Won't buy it back.,0
I have not ordered this bottle from Amazon but just got my nails done in the salon with Rose Bud. The picture posted is significantly different than what the color is in real life. Warning- it's a much paler pink.,0
"I usually never do this, write reviews, but I hate this curling iron i've owned it for a week now. I curl my hair everyday and this curling iron doesn't hold the curl. I decided to buy it for a replacement and after seeing the great reviews I thought okay i'll give a try, I have a Hot Tools straightner for 5 years already and it still works like the first day I bought it but this curling iron for me is a disapointment.",0
have to turn off water and stand there for a few minutes,0
"I thought perhaps I'd found a less expensive version of my favorite Diptique Feu de Bois candles... alas, this is more piney, spice, with a tiny hint of wood smoke. Nothing like the smoky, rich scent I love.

This is a very nice candle and clearly high-quality, but it smells like a fir tree, and not really a burning one at that.",1
"Does a pretty good job of cleaning make up, but I use a cleanser first, then finish with this.",1
"Excellent product, especially for tinted hair that is blown dry and curled wih an iron.",1
"Works well and fits easily into my handbag.  I already have the larger size, so now I'm happy with both of my Mason Pearsons!",1
Love this color for summer! Arrived on my doorstep very quickly,1
The product was open inside the packaging and leaked everywhere so was unable to be used.  Of the three packages purchased 2 leaked.,0
"I don't think this was real. The box came and it was obviously used before, maybe only a few times but the cover for the bottle, not the cap, was not original like I had normally bought in the past. Anyways I wear retinol on my face and now my entire face is burned up. I've used this before and it worked fine, which leads me to believe the seller has sold me a defected product!",0
I love this toner but I am questioning the red dye.  Why did you have to add color to it?  Seems extremely unnecessary.  Can't you just accept the natural color which is most likely colorless and leave it as is?,1
As expected,1
Did not remove a single hair. Total waste of time and money. And smells bad.,0
"I've tried the Proraso soap for sensitive skin and the refreshing/toning soap. Both of those are excellent, but this is my favorite of the three. This soap builds an excellent lather and leaves your skin feeling great after a shave. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the Proraso soaps honestly, but I think this one is definitely worth a shot if you haven't tried it.",1
very good but not perfect as slightly sensitive when applied,1
"I was looking for a powerful blowdryer and knowing that Babybliss has a great reputation, I decided to try this blowdryer because of the ""xtreme"" in the title and the 2000 watts listed.
Unfortunately it was weak and did not have much power at all. My 1745 blowdryer was much stronger and more powerful.
My second issue with this dryer was the buttons to power it on and off. They are flat and very hard to slide on and off. I found myself needed both hands to turn the buttons on/off cold/hot.",0
"This is the best curling iron I have ever owned, I purchased this like 4 years ago and it still works amazing, the curls last for days. Great product.",1
Very disappointed in perfume. I didn't realize scent of perfume is different than eau de toilette..  I do not like the smell at all ..,0
"great product, have used for more than 40 years along with lip protectant stick, and never had chopped lips.",1
Great product. Holds hair tight and heats up fast. For some reason I thought 3/4 was a bit fatter but that was my error. I can still use it and will definitely buy Hot Tools in the future!,1
"I loved my Amazon Luxury Sample Box it was filled with all sorts of different products. I am an avid subscription boxer and this would be amazing if it was monthly. Sure I won't use all the samples, but there is something for everyone. And the products I won't use I can pass along to family.",1
Wayyyy too heavy. I gave it to my roommate who doesn't breakout.,0
"I started using this on the advice of my dermatologist, for my rosacea, combined with first-Doryx and then weaning down to Oracea. The bumps on my face have lessened a lot - HOWEVER I can't say that it is due to the Peche. I suspect that my bumps have gone down due to the medication which is known to reduce bumps. The redness has gone down slightly but my face is still really red. The Peche has not reduced the dry patch that is on the area that I have rosacea. I was instructed to use the Peche 1-2 times a day and it has lasted me so far at least 3 months and I'm about halfway through the container. I will probably not be buying Peche once it runs out because the results aren't certain enough to justify the price.",0
"A little goes a long way. After fixing my bad color job that my last colorist did, I needed to find something to get my hair back from crunchy. This was it!  My hair is soft and no longer crunchy.",1
"I got this in light brown.  I have slight hair loss from a medication I was taking, at my crown.  This looks like dirt, & sucks the shine from my hair wherever it falls.  The color is not even remotely brown or light brown.  More grayish black brown. I gave it 2 stars because I like the shake it on container.",0
i have very dry skin and this was too thick and greasy for me. it made my face look like an oil slick and has an extremely unpleasant smell to it.,0
Great product at a great price.,1
I really like Bioelements Crucial Moisture.  This cream hydrates well and has a wonderful aroma.  It's good for anyone with dry skin.,1
Happy to recevid it. Good and soft for skin no pain..,1
"The blow dryer is nice- it is quiet and reduces some of the frizz. I am not sure if it really cuts my drying time ""drastically"" but I believe it does cut it down some. Most importantly my hair does not seem to be as fuzzy or straw like when i use this hair dryer compared to other ionic dryers I have purchased at the drug stores.",1
"It's been 5 months and not a single hair has grown that wasn't my own before I bought this item.  I have doubted other reviews mostly by people selling the product used suggesting that they just gave up after a month or two of use. I have use this religiously for five months now, and although the manufacturer says six months of use is recommended, i've use this as directed and without any results. I'm not bald I simply have thinning hair in the front and would be considered a perfect candidate for this product.  I'll change my review if for some miraculous reason new hair, allegedly up to some 30 follicles per square inch, happen to appear!",0
"Very nourishing. I can just rub it in, comb it through and rinse and my hair is conditioned. I don't have processed hair right now.",1
My new favorite scent.  This is a wonderful soft floral scent - long lasting too.  It makes your skin so soft.,1
Does anyone know if it helps blondes with swimmers hair? I swim everyday and my hair is greenish from the chlorine. My stylist said paul mitchell purple shampoo would be the best but i'm not sure if this is the one she is referring to.,0
"The product works very well and makes the colors pop up.
The bottle is quite small and besides that ONLY came HALF full.  A big robbery, I'll NEVER buy it here again",0
I have been using this product for two years. I initially purchased it from Costco and really loved how it worked for me. This purchase was awful. It actually burned the skin under my eyes. Really disappointed in Amazon for allowing this product to be sold under their name.,0
Nice fresh clean scent.,1
"I had originally intended to cancel this purchase, but by the time I tried to do so, it was too late and the item was on its way. I decided to try it anyway and am so glad this item was not cancelled. I have very thin baby hair and it's thinning more every day. After I tried the product, I felt like it was thickening my hair, but it was confirmed when one of my friends commented that my hair looked thicker. ""Yippee, skippy!"" Finally a hair product that delivers!

I highly recommend this item if you are in need of some hair volume.",1
"If you have hard to grow nails OPI Nail Envy Original, helped me grow my nails.  My nail always chipping, breaking and after using this product.  My nails are long, strong, and beautiful.  Give it try, you will love it.",1
Didn't work for me.,0
one of the best facial masks ive ever used.,1
Crappy samples and very limited items to use your credit on.,0
Nice but pricey!,1
"Applicator worked great at first but then it started spraying the product out of the bulb that is pressed down. Purchased another one to only have a problem with that one too.  When it worked it was great, but it didn't last too long.",0
"There is something wrong with this product. I have used Awapui Moisture Mist on my hair for years and it always has a lovely fragrance. This smells dreadful, like old socks. It must be counterfeit or outdated.",0
"Love this stuff. I've got thicker coarser hair (Korean), and this stuff holds up. Note: I do put a small amount of hair spray on to ensure my hair stays in place throughout the day. It gets unwieldy if I don't.",1
"I did not purchase this on amazon but at a beauty supply store. (I have a license.)
For years I have been getting fake nails because my polish would chip the same day I got a manicure!  I never had good nails.

I tried gels,  I hated the taking it off part.  Then a couple of women were asking about vinylux and I decided to try it.  I didn't think it would work!!!!!  1 week and still no chips!!!!  It also makes my nails stronger..

I have been waiting for a product I can do at home.  I bought the top coat along with 3 colors.",1
All OK,1
I wanted to like this product because it received some great reviews but it just didn't do much for my hair. I was hoping it could give it a little body and some texture but it almost dulled it out. Kind of upsetting with the price point.,0
"Not good for my skin, which is very sensitive.",0
"My favorite color, and it never dries out.",1
This was terrible. It was sticky and absolutely had nothing promised in the add when I bought it. The whole reason I bought it was cuz i thought it said i would feel a Tingling sensation.  This product was a disappointing buy.,0
"Fast shipping, product just as described",1
"I bought soft shell, is some pink tone, the foundation is matte, I have pores not too big, but this foundation make look the pores more big. Is not bad foundation, but maybe works better for very young skin. Not for me, I have mix skin, near 40's",1
Good for light facial cleansing. Not for deep cleansing,1
Definitely not the same product,0
great,1
I didn't even try the dryer.  It's too heavy and there is no way I would be able to dry my hair with it every day.,0
Eh I wasn't that impressed I lightened my dirty blonde hair a few days prior and my hair came out with orange tones. I was hoping for better results I used it six times and didn't see much change if any. I had to stop using it due to my hair started falling out o_0 I am now trying to undo the dryness caused from using this product every 3 days.,0
"As a female who just started using the LaserComb Professional 12, I have to say that the results are beyond disappointing. I've only been using the product for 4 weeks and my hair is getting worse. That's right, I have MORE hair loss! I should mention that I over-used the product when I purchased it because, as a former professional hair laser user, I couldn't understand how 8 minutes would have any results, and I spent extra time concentrating on the bald patches (wouldn't it make sense to use it more in the areas where there is no hair?). The HairMax representatives claim that shedding is to be expected for the first 8 weeks (they don't tell you this at the point of purchase), and that it should stop in another month...but no guarantees on how much I should expect to lose. While the company markets the product to ""promote hair growth,"" they fail to say exactly how much hair will grow because everyone experiences different results. I don't like being in the dark and gambling with little hair I have left. I'd say I've lost 20-25% of my hair so far. When pressed for a response, the reps will say that hair growth is ""estimated"" at 25%....so does that mean I'm back where I started? What if the hair never grows back? Turns out I can't file a lawsuit because they list HAIR LOSS AS A SIDE EFFECT.

The most frustrating part is that the HairMax forum is moderated by a company employee who filters out the responses from the community. And after googling ""lasercomb bad results"", lasercomb makes hair worse"", etc. nothing but glowing reviews appeared, which made me even more suspicious. I desperately need to hear from other female users who've had poor results because I find it hard to believe I'm the only one. If anyone has had a similar experience, please send me your comments!",0
Helps alot,1
"Nice smell, and very refreshing on my face.",1
Very happy with this.,1
I have very sparse lashes and the bristles on the brush are too far apart so they do not catch each lash.  I have to apply several coats and it ends up making a mess.  It definitely does not smudge or cause raccoon eyes and does wash off easily but I will not order ir again due to the brush style.,0
"The texture of this hand cream is significantly thinner than the Shea Butter version. I like the fact that it is easier to blend; however, the trade off is that it is less moisturizing. The reason why I am only giving it two stars is because I disliked the smell (very floral, slightly nutty) and I found that my hands were still quite dry even after using it. I would not recommend nor repurchase.",0
Not the same product I've ordered in the past. The past formula ingredients are listed differently and this version has more chemicals first and doesn't say Loma Organics.,0
"Meh. Disappointed with the color. I thought it would be a brighter, pink color but it's more of a matte, mauve color. Not very ""hawaii"" like. I'm wearing it now on my toes. Like all OPI nail polishes, it goes on smoothly and easily. A double coat definitely makes the color pop. But I'm only giving the color 3 stars because it's not pretty.

UPDATE: So I looked at the color in the sunlight, and it is actually quite nice. It reminds me of the pink/mauve color in a sunset, or some sort of delicious alcoholic beverage with an umbrella in it. I'm pleased with the smooth application, and that it dried into more of a pink/purple/mauve color. The color is a muted, understated color with a surprising pink in sunlight.",1
"I love this product and what it does for my skin. It gets rid of wrinkles and seems to tighten my skin as well. I just can't understand why it went up eight bucks in three months and that is why I am leaving this review with one star, to hopefully send a message to amazon that even though I like what the product is doing for my skin, I don't like the games they play.",0
"like the concept, but color didn't show at all on my- I bought the ruby instead and LOVE it",1
Smells great and makes your hair shiny!! Love this stuff,1
"Not the real BaBylissPRO Nano.

I have this exact model and type of babyliss straightener before I ordered this one off Amazon. It's a wonderful straightener! However, the one that they sent me was not the same. The color was different. the heat settings were not the same. It felt completely different running this one through my hair as opposed to my other one.

The BaByliss PRO nano is an excellent straightener; however, this is not the BaByliss PRO. I strongly believe that this is a fake. It's still a decent straightener. but don't advertise something that you're not please. People will be disappointed.",0
"I ordered the shampoo and received the conditioner instead, which is NOT what I needed!",0
Works great!  I will stick with this product!,1
"As with most anti-aging products, what you get is deflated hope and a thinner wallet.  While I like this lotion as a lotion, it did no long-term good in terms of volumizing the skin on my hands, reducing that crepe-like look, etc.  There was some improvement in the texture of my skin when I first applied the lotion, perhaps more improvement than is provided by other products, but it did not last.  Wash your hands and the benefit is gone.  Due to the expense of this product and the minimal, temporary results it delivers, I would not recommend it.",0
"BAD
Dont buy from this supplier",0
"This stuff is great does wonders for my hair , and it smells heavenly!!i highly recommend this , worth the price you pay",1
I purchase this flat iron from a Paul Mitchell certified distributor and I really wanted to like these but I'm so disappointed .. My hair burnt at a setting of 350 you could literally smell the burnt hair and the plates don't touch so when you flat iron your hair your strands slip right through. I'm gonna stick with my Red Pro silicon protexion flat irons they've worked extremely well...I guess it's true when ppl say just stick to what u know ..hopefully others will have a better experience,0
"Hairspray was really really old and my Grandaughter was by me when I sprayed the first spray on my hair and she said""What is that bad smell Oma? I said bad old hair spray. The same thing they wanted me to send this back and they new they have to know that their buying old product. What a shame it was a lot when you add the two together 40 some dollars I could not afford they are in the garbadge.",0
Provides the right amount of moisture!,1
Very gentle and moisturizing.,1
"I bought this product after seeing it used by my favorite stylist. I do love the smell and it gives your hair a nice glossy shine. The only downfall is that it doesn't have any hold. Your hair looks perfect for the first few minutes, but any waves don't last without another hairspray.",1
"This  one specifically was too thick and of course you can not polish your nails perfectly. I am assuming its either deffective or was already opened, it does not matter, an exchange is fine with me but...I contacted the store and they don't have the best customer service.",0
"This is the prettiest color for your nails to look clean, natural with a hint of the most beautiful shade of natural pink",1
The best mascara Ive ever used!!,1
This product does not stay on my face. I do not like the coverage.,0
"It only takes a small amount to wash your face, it feels so smooth and clean.  So glad I found this !",1
greatest lip gloss ever. don't hesitate. just trust me and buy it. it'll be your favorite lip gloss forever.,1
Was a different consistency than what I bought in the salon. Seems like it had been melted in transit and was more like tar.,0
Good,1
Love it,1
Im really picky about mascara. I already have thick dark lashes and like a mascara to curl and separate. This is so clumpy and thick. I have to wipe off most of the product to get a decent application.,0
"I'd been using a glycolic pad treatment from the dermatologist for about six months, every other day, with great results. The problem was it was so very expensive. It seemed like I could purchase the same basic thing online and save quite a bit, however after using it a few times I realize this product causes some type of reaction on my skin, even if I just wipe it on and wash it off afterward. It could be an allergy, but I wanted to throw this out mostly because I never had a problem with the dermatologist's formula. Just be cautious and maybe do a small test on your skin. If it turns red immediately you might not want to rub it all over your face. I do like to use it on my dry heels, however. Softens that skin and doesn't cause a reaction there...",0
I love this facial spray by Mario badescu. For the price I don't mind adding it into my routine. I use it to set my makeup and give it a nice Dewey finish as well as after I wash my face I feel like it helps with redness and locks in moisture,1
Doesn't last very long compared to ones you find in store,0
"Didn't seem to help a whole ton. Still itchy, still scaly. Was hopeful for results.",0
Great product quickly delivered. Amazing results.,1
It's garbage,0
"I wanted to like this product, but it is not happening. I have blondish hair that I have to wash EVERY day, because it gets greasy after 12-24 hours. Ive tried all kinds of shampoos and products and nothing seams to help. I put this in my hair around my ear and scalp where it gets oily the next morning and nothing. Didnt seem to help a bit. So now to continue my mission for a effective dry shampoo....",0
I have tried many different nail strengtheners this one is great.  It doesnt peel or chip off you could use it under an polish.  I usually just use this as my clear when I don't put polish on.,1
Not the same product,0
"From all the hype of the Jimmy Choo women's fragrances, I was tremendously excited to try the men's version.  Out of the bottle, I was impressed with the blend of fruit, patchouli, and suede notes.  Very nice.  Then the drydown - or better said - the ""let down"".  I get four (4) hours max longevity from Jimmy Choo with modest projection/sillage at arms length for two (2) hours. I have worn this fragrance twice, each providing the same results.  I will, however, admit the second use performed better in cooler weather and lasted longer on clothing.

Given the complexity of the notes, I would suggest that Choo does provide flexibility to be worn during any season and for most events.  It is definitely office safe for those with more sensitive noses.  With the hype of the fragrance, I do see Choo worn by a younger crowd and out ""clubbing"" (or whatever it is called these days - my ""clubbing"" days are long gone..!!).  Additionally, this fragrance is almost borderline unisex and I could definitely see that ""daring"" young lady pull this off, or perhaps layer with one of her favorite fragrances.

I do love the bottle - clear with a ""smoky"" finish and subtle curvature that is a nice touch.  The price is moderate and average for any designer fragrance - if you give it time, I am certain you will see it at discount department stores - just like the Choo women's editions.

A final tally for Jimmy Choo for Men is 4 stars out of 5 stars.  It is a very pleasant scent, but the performance is on the weak side.  I like it, but it falls short of loving it status.  If you are a collector and ""want to join the crowd"", pick it up and add to your increasing collection.  Otherwise, pass on Choo and ""save it for a rainy day"".

Enjoy your day and make it count.  Invest your time rather than wasting your time...",1
"After looking for a razor that wouldn't give  me razor burn.  I tried all the major brands and the online subscription razor brands too. Then I finally happened onto a YouTube video that explained the benefits of using a safety razor.

They convinced me (along with learning shaving against the grain is bad practice), that one blade is best.

No more razor burn, razor bumps, or in-grown hairs.  It also helps to change the blade regularly, I do mine once per week. Also to use a quality shaving cream, not the junk from the big box stores.

This razor is quality built, nice ergonomics, and weight in your hand.",1
"I thought more colors would come through...they didn't, just light pink.  Plus, it doesn't last that long on the eyes.",0
"I love how these work, but thought they were a little expensive for the amount.",1
"I didn't find this product, either the handle of the brush head to do much good.",0
Minimal results after three months dedicated use,0
Glad I got the smallest size to try. I keep my hair cropped pretty close (1/4-1/2 an inch); this ended up just looking like powder on my scalp. The medium brown also has a green tint to it.,0
"I bought this product based on the high ratings. But my eyes water and this liner didn't perform any better than all other liners and pencils I've tried. After only a few minutes the liner is smudged. I also don't like products packaged so that I don't know when it's running out. Am very surprised at the number of glowing reviews I gave it two stars because it is easy to apply (though not so if you want a thicker line) and it's very neat to use. At the price, I wish I'd gotten my money back.",0
I'm a huge Essie fan and loved this color in the salon. Bought on Amazon and it was goopy and not the quality I've learned to expect. Something was off.,0
Had a horrible chemical smell like ammonia or windex. None of the other items I purchased in this line had any odor. The top plunger part seemed like a different color from the bottle. Not sure if it was tampered with since you can screw off the plunger and the box was opened. Wouldn't purchase this item here again. Returning item for a refund. Will buy in stores to try item.,0
"Ok , so my brother bought this cologne without ever smelling it! He went by reviews and all the hype this cologne got. Well he loves the smell. It captivated him but the only problem with this cologne is that the smells lasts for a while . Maybe 1hr tops! He had to basically take a shower using this cologne to maintain the smell going. He wishes that the smell would of hold to its wonderful scent, the bottle is elegant too.",1
I bought this for my wife and she is very happy with this.,1
I have really curly hair and I use this just to clean it. It works great and I love how it heats up fast and works great every time. My old one had the spring break so I do recommend buying these one amazon rather than double the price in a store.,1
"The delivery was great but the perfume is not the original, is so different.",0
not seeing obvious whitening so far. but maybe i should use more frequently. it drys fast and doesn't irritates sensitive skin.,1
The palette arrive today.  Looks absolutely amazing.  Too bad it's broken into pieces.  My first makeup purchase from amazon.com...  I never have this problem with ulta/sephora/makeup manufactures.,0
"This item smoked and then died on the second use
Don't waste your money!",0
For me this product just did not work. My hair is noticeable thinning in the front due to hair loss from medications. When I applied it as directed all it did was make my scalp look filthy dirty. I sent it back for a refund.,0

"You can get better results from doing about 5 minutes of facial exercises a day as I did before purchasing this device. Was getting lazy about the yoga and saw this as an easy way out. Have faithfully used the device as instructed for 10 months with no permanent results.  Started off with very good skin with newer formation of wrinkles around mouth and jaw area due to advancing age.  With the yoga, the results were longer lasting for me.  This device gives a temporary plump, probably from the stimulation but I suspect i could pinch my face all over and get the same results!  Am back to facial exercises which also are more relaxing. and just use this before a social event to plump things up for a couple of hours.",0
Overrated... I don't see any difference between this and water besides the delightful scent.,0
This dries out on brush before 3rd pass even with ample supply of water. Dries out face and results in several nicks. I get a better shave with a $5 tube of Arko. Very disappointing.,0
These make my lips dry and peeling.,0
it's ok....not worth money,0
Gives my fine hair extra thickness without weighing it down.,1
Love this hairdryer!  Would highly recommend it!,1

Pretty classy nuetral looks good on my light olive skin tone. Im in healthcare and this looks clean and professional. Essie always pleases!,1
It works! Got many compliments on my lashes!,1
"Ive been using this shampoo for about 44 days and I get mild scalp acne and dandruff. My hair is very oily. The first week I notice my scalp became more itchy, but I disregarded it because I thought I needed to get used to it. The itching contributed onto the month. 2 weeks after use, my scalp began to break out very bad. My face has been clear and thank god it got spared, but my scalp was going through hell for 2 weeks. Nevertheless, I kept on using it. Bad idea. 4 weeks in and I had about 12 pimples on my scalp. The itching was worse than ever and my scalp was red. I decided to stop using it everyday and only every other day. No results and after 40 days, I stopped, which was just this past week. I can already see an improvement on my scalp ever since I stopped using it. I had mild scalp acne (like 4 pimples a month) and mild dandruff and I thought this shampoo would help but it ultimately made it much much worse. It was so bad I got an acne scar and hence, a bald spot on my scalp. I don't know what it could have been since I'm not allergic to anything, just cats lol. Anyway, it was a pricey investment that didn't work for me. I'm back to using the $1 vo5 and it made my scalp better.",0
It was dryed out!,0
"I will use this bottle but wil not buy again, i don't like the lsit of ingredients.  I bought one in Tj max, with more natural ingredients and much more product",0
"Love it, use this product everyday, bought this one for my second home. Have bought a few over the years but this product is perfect fior me!",1
"I like the compact form factor and it's effectiveness at cleaning. However, like many other users, the battery died in less than a year. The red light comes on and stops working. The customer service was great, it offered me replacement for Smart Profile Uplift or another Mia Fit. I picked Smart Profile Uplift because I know the replacement is probably going to die in 8 months... I will miss the small form factor for ease of travel.

1 star for the battery
5 start for the customer service
5 stars for the 8 months that was working perfectly.",1
Giving two Stars nectar I like the scent of the product. What can I say.. use a  little and it does absolutely nothing but make your hair shiny and smell good. There was no hold or way to shape my hair. The product did not have any hold until a generous amount was used which makes your hair stiff and unmanageable,0
I applied this after I washed my hair with bumble bee and bumble bee thickening shampoo and conditioner. After I blow dried with a round brush. There really was no difference. I couldn't even feel any product in my hair. If I could return this I would.,0
I brought this because it's the brand that my beautician used for my facial. Not the same product. Doesn't smell as strong and doesn't bring result. So disappointed!,0
"Great ease and control with plastic bristles. Doesn't tangle. This is my 3rd one, if that's indication. And not my last.",1
Do not buy this you are waisting your money!,0
I use this all the time....,1
"It is just okay.  Need to keep adding, drop by drop.",0
Not working properly.,0
my wife seems to like it,1
"Was a bit disappointed with this. I have very fine hair that tends to go flat, i was hoping that this product would add a lil volume. It does add texture, but nothing that hairspray wouldn't do. It makes my shiny hair sticky ... ughhhh.

Not a great Product !",0
"Not going to replace the powder, certainly . . . . maybe my nozzle came broken, but it doesn't spray symmetrically, which is a problem.",0
"Well make, it protects my eyeshadows. I got one when I ordered the life palette.",1
"This is a quality iron that gets hot very quickly.  Straightens hair and easy to handle. The off switch can be turn on when straightening your hair
Make sure to use a heat protectant",1
Great hold but gets flakey late in the day. I'll stick with the Re-Shaper!,0
nice,1
Beautiful color! Love CND products!,1
"Works well, but I don't love the smell",1
"Don't waste time reading reviews. Just. Buy. It.
I have not a single complaint. My nail polish is still going strong and it's been 12 days.",1
first time I have ever done a review. I use the St Tropez tanner...Tried the gradual tan in shower and have used it 4 times with no tan results at all...plus it makes my skin dry...Not happy with this product.,0
Dryer broke after about three months of using it.,0
Seems to keep my foreo clean. I use it about once a week to clean it.,1
"This product gives just the right amount of color, easy to use and it lasts all day.  Will order again.",1
"I gave this one star because my zero star submission wasn't accepted.  I didn't realize this thing would be smaller than my finger...missed that in the description.  It's fine for combing my mustache, but have a hard time combing my beard with it (and I use beard oil daily, so it's not like I have split ends and tangles).  AND, though it was shipped in the same box as my VitaBeard, I was charged separate S&H - $5.22 for the small bottle of VitaBeard and another $5.48 for the tiny replica of a comb....absolutely ridiculous!  I am very disappointed and will NOT be recommending this comb to friends.  Baxter of California should make it clear to potential customers how small the comb is.  I for one will NOT be purchasing anything from them ever again.",0
Did not like how it made my hair feel. Gave it away to housemates daughter.,0
"This oil does leave your skin feeling silky afterwards. I have sensitive skin and it made me a bit itchy, so I passed it on to my daughter who loves it. The smell is okay, but I think it could be better.",1
Dont buy! If you don't keep it charged it stops working. 1 year warranty after that you are out of luck! Cant replace the battery! Contacted the company and they offered 25% off to buy another one. Are you kidding me? I don't have $100 to keep spending on this!,0
Too expensive for what you receive!,0
Works great!  I will stick with this product!,1
"Ouch!  This stuff burns like liquid fire!  I did not see any discernible difference in my lashes so I went back to my go to, Rapid Lash.",0
"I have used this drying lotion before and I really like it. If I catch a blemish early, it dries it up overnight; also, it I haved used it on mosquito bites and it took care of them.  I have really sensitive skin and cannot use a lot of products, however, have not had a problem with Mario Badescu drying lotion. I, also, bought a bottle for a friend.",1
Didn't seem to help my hair at all personally.  Didn't make it worse either though I guess.  Wouldn't buy it again.,0
it has paraben and mineral oil :(,0
"It's not good. I don't like the color at all, the consistency is unpleasant on my lips- sticky and color doesn't spread well.
I wish I didn't spend my $ on it.",0
"This is NOT really OPI. I purchased and used and it was so hard to paint on my nails. It was like glue. I purchased OPI from Sallys later that day to try and it was completely different and better. You cannot return this item. Save your time and money.

(I buy from Amazon at least once a week... never had an issue like this before.)",0
"Not only is this stuff water thin, it is very pricey and smells awful. I'm giving it away, If you have to do any LAFCO products do the Claus Porto (Favorite is my favorite). Waste of my money.",0
"Thanks to my hair dresser for recommending this product to me. I absolutely love it. I like to recommend this product to others for it's quality. Your hair is going to appreciate it. Don't hesitate, just get one to try. Once you try this product you will stay with it. Good luck!!!",1
just started using it will see over time  like osmosis products,1
It did not stay all day...disappointed.,0
After using this product for less then one week I had a terrible skin reaction from this product! First the area around my eyes started to look bruised then a day later the burning sensation started. Then my skin started the peel like after a sun- burn! I could barely open my eyes.  The skin around my eyes is finally starting to look and fee better.  I would not use this product or recommend it to anyone. I guess I am o.k. with my skin after all!,0
"Doesn't wash off makeup, leaves my face feeling dirty and like I haven't washed it yet. Very weird smell too, and you need a lot for each application. Not for me. Would not buy again.",0
this crumbles under my eye area and it actually makes me feel that it makes my wrinkles worse!,0
"kills the natural shine of hair. When I wash off this Oribe "" super shine "" ,that my natural shine  comes back. There can be a problem in that very old and exp.dare  for a long time has ended,Awful ! This is not super shine ,this is super -dull moisturizing !",0
when I used it I cried for the whole time because of the terrible fumes hurting my eyes from chemical fumes. Yes my face was smooth after but it was not worth the torture,0
"Had a rash on my neck after a week of use, Product not for me.",0
This didn't work very well,0
"I love this stuff. It is affordable, smells good and makes my skin feel refreshed. Also works well as a makeup setting spray.",1
good for body not hair,1
"have used this for many years. not the cheapest out there, but if you care what you are putting on your skin this stuff is great. does not leave white haze on skin, goes on very smooth (not too thick)",1
I was disappointed with this base coat. I always dread getting glitter nail polish off so thought that this might be the perfect solution. It helped it come off so much that my entire nail color was peeling off the next day!  It is also a matte white do I do not think you could put a clear glitter top coat over it.,0
I like this lip stain alot.  A little goes along way and it does not feel too too dry like many mattes tend to.,1
Probably nothing wrong.  I just don't like it.,0
"The scent of this conditioner definitely leans towards the peppermint and tea tree oil; I really don't get the basil scent at all. It has a creamy texture without the slickness of typical conditioners. On application it gives your scalp a very cool sensation, most likely from the peppermint oil, and that coolness lasts a while after rinsing. It is strong but not enough to tear my eyes. It did leave my hair smooth and shiny as advertised. The tube is pretty large and there's plenty of product inside; you don't need much to cover your whole head. I have a slight sunburn on my forehead and I was a concerned when the conditioner touched that area because I wasn't expecting such a cool 'rush'. But it did not sting and was OK.",1
One of the best kept secrets for getting rid of blemishes! Love this drying lotion!,1
I was very unhappy with this product. My face immediately (within 6 hours of use) broke out in HUGE cystic pimples on my forehead and nasal labial folds. I was blemish free prior to using the product.  I never have acne!  I have used other IMAGE products before without difficulty and now i'm stuck with 2 bottles of this.,0
"The pump/cap part does not work after a while, can't spray normally and there is still a lot of water in it.  After reading the reviews I don't think I'm alone.  So I think the quality of the bottle is not so good.

I suggest people who are reading this review use it within a short period of time or switch to another brand",0
My hair is hard to curl so even though this item got hot enough the barrell size I believe was to big.,1
This is an older bottle and I am not thrilled about that. I wonder if it will work as well.,0
"This stuff works wonders at first, by it seems to dry out soon. So now I have to buy a brand new one for all the CND nail polish I have.",0
"I'm giving the Cargo Liquid Foundation one star.  It was watery and provided little coverage.  I had to reapply it so often it was effectively useless.  Cargo has been my brand of foundation for years.  Something changed.  That's too bad - it was really good, a while ago.",0
"It's smell nothing ,like only water on the container. When you applied in your skin ,it feels water applying to your skin .Not like I previously bought.",0
The lid on this was up and I lost part of the shampoo.  Second time this has happened!,1
I did not like the way it was package and sent in the mail. Its a great oil.,1
"Nothing negative to say, but I haven't noticed any huge positive benefits either.  Sticking with it.",1
"i absolutely love this color! i have worn it now for about 2 months straight. i cant find a better purple!
i have a teal that i go back and forth on but this is always my color i go back to - always happy with it.",1
"The first one of these I bought had the ""vanilla"" scent. It was great. Long wearing, but didn't feel thick or goopy. I just loved it. The next one had the ""light cucumber"" scent. It was awful. Tacky, goopy and felt terrible on your lips. The scent is actually irritating. If this is the real deal and they just changed their formula, it was a big mistake. Avoid the shades offering the ""light cucumber"" scent. Yuk.",0
This product did not behave like the exact product I purchased at the dermatologists office.  I loved that sunscreen!  This one made my skin an oily mess.  Buyer beware.  This is probably not authentic.,0
This is literally the only heel cream that I have EVER tried that works. AMAZING!,1
Not the same results as the same product from a salon. Must be old product.,0
Smells amazing and delivers,1
"After one month I am noticing a difference!  I feel my skin looks brighter, less splotchy, fuller.  Now waiting for someone else to notice!  Easy to use.",1
Smells nice.,1
"It was the best dryer that I've ever owned. However, two months later the low speed stopped working, and it shoots out sparks if you put it in low. It works fine as long as it is in high, but I tend to use the low speed more often. Of course, I've tossed the box and now need to find the original paperwork to figure out if I can return it to the manufacturer. Frustrating and disappointing.",0
Perfect color for discret but trendy look,1
"This body balm is amazing! Turned my pale uneven veiny legs tan and silky smooth.
Its the consistency of a lotion and absorbs quickly. The bottle is slightly smaller than what I was imagining but I think itll be good for at least 20 applications on legs. I ordered the color latte which is perfect for me when Im not tan. I ordered the mocha darker color for when Im tan. Will update photos of color comparison. Current photo is latte.",1
Great,1
"For my first shave soap it works fine, wish it had a better smell for my taste.",1
After 1 week it became clogged and couldn't use anymore. Too expensive to keep replacing every week.,0
"This is the NEW FORMULA. Be warned. It's nothing like the old formula which is now called ""Pure Volume Extra Care"". New formula is worse than any cheapo shampoo I've ever used. This stuff makes Prell look luxurious. Cannot understand why the product team at Pureology would mess with something that always had 5-star reviews and worked so well?!? The fact that they had to keep the old formula available proves that new formula isn't being welcomed with open arms. Think ""new coke"". UGH",0
Great product. Doesn't run and burn your eyes. This is my daily ho to,1
Didn't like this product I wouldn't purchase again,0
Favorite eyecream use daily am & pm.,1
Great product,1
Works like it said,1
"So far so good.  I have pretty clean skin...problematic near chin (every now & then will get a cystic pimple); I didn't have immediate results, but am about halfway through the bottle and will probably buy again.  It does leave your skin feeling very smooth and clean...I do use a makeup remover before using it.  Haven't had a cystic acne since I bought it, but will see how it goes as I continue to go through the bottle.  I do have to say my skin feels and looks better - just slow improvement.",1
Worked one month and then stopped heating up,0
"good color, goes on well...",1
crappy dispenser... never foams right. gets all over the place... too bad.,0
"I bought three different colors of this dreamy looking nail polish and used them as stocking stuffers (including my own!)  The sheen is lovely, but the polish chips easily, and can't be worn without a topcoat, as even two coats won't stand up to normal wear and tear for even a day.",0
"I bought this after reading good reviews and seeing a few recommendations, thinking that it would work for me if it did for plenty of other people but it made absolutely no difference in my skin. Maybe it works for other people, however I wouldn't recommend it.",0
"I bought it from Drugstore.com. Usually I love OPI polishes but with DS Radiance DS038 I have a love-hate relationship.
It goes on great and is almost opaque in one coat. I have always been a ""two coat minimum"" gal though. It looks phenomenal! What I do not like is the wearability factor. DS038 started to chip, peal, and rub off in just a day. Last photo shows the extreme wear on day 2. For that reason, I gave it 2 stars.",0
"This stuff is amazing.  It has softened my forehead wrinkles so much.  No scent and easy to carry and use. Its not oily or greasy, jist auper nice to use.",1
I do like it.  Pricey,1
Always helps to clear up a stubborn breakout.,1
"Cheapest, flimsiest flat iron I've owned since middle school when I bought a con-air metal platted hair straightener. I bought this flat iron because I have long been a GHD fan-- my first GHD lasted 6 years, my second lasted 2 years, and my third lasted only 2 months. It appears GHD's quality has decreased exponentially over the last 9 years, so I decided to cut my losses and try something new. The reviews on  t3 were decent-- nobody was complaining about it breaking after 2 months so that was already an improvement, and a woman at Sephora recommended it so I thought to give it a try. Talk about disappointment. First, it feels like it probably costs about 12 cents to make. Cheap, extremely flimsy, creaky-sounding plastic. Despite the multiple choice heat selection, even on level 5 it gets about as hot as my old GHD's did when you first press ""on"" before they heated up. One pass? Try about 30 passes. Second, even doing the tiniest increments of hair, your hair still gets caught and pulled. I have long, THIN hair-- just a lot of it. I used this thing after ALREADY BLOWING OUT MY HAIR (e.g. totally straight just with more volume than I would like), and it took about half an hour just to get my hair SLIGHTLY flatter than before. I can't even imagine how long it would take if I tried to use this thing if my hair was curly or wavy. Biggest waste of money, thank god for Amazon's return policy. Oh, the hair clips are really great. That's about the only positive I can say for this thing.",0
Two weeks now not very good change,0
"I really like the konjac sponge, its not overly abrasive or too harsh for everyday use. Great for exfoliating and keeping skin smooth.  I didn't like the oil this came with, it has a weird smell that stays for a while. Ill be ordering the konjac sponge again",1
I was so excited to try this product because of all of the reviews.  Unfortunately it did not work for me. It would wear off and stick to the fold in my eye and that was hard to remove. Them after about 1 month it wouldn't even work on my eye like it dried out already. I don't know if it was my skin oils or if it was a defected product but either way so bummed it didn't work for me :((,0
"Revision Intellishade SPF 45.

 I love this product.  Having had a few  skin cancers  on my face removed, I know how important it is to apply sunscreen every day. This product is my sunscreen, moisturizer, foundation all in one. It is light, sheer, and good for all skin shades.  I have been using this product for  three years and would not use anything else on my face.",1
Really devastating to nails,0
"I really like that this is 2000 watts, drys my hair much quicker and it has 2 setting both for speed and temp.",1
"Goes on very splotchy.  I was extremely disappointed.  Normally, I used the pressed mineral powder and love it.  This product is a NO-GO :-(",0
"I honestly don't notice a difference, even after several uses.",0
"I purchased the Olaplex because of a review I read on Amazon.
I used this product before I processed my hair perm and again after.
It was totally amazing, my hair which was damaged due to previous processing did not
break, it was not dry looking, it was silky and shiny after the hair perm.
I have recommended this to my Manager at work and she purchased it as well.
I have been a cosmetologist for over 30 years and never found anything that worked this well.
The Redken product has changed over the years, it is not as good and did nothing for my hair.
Thank you.",1
"Barely any coverage (even for a tinted moisturizer), left an greasy sheen, irritating (stinging feeling.) Not impressed with Juice Beauty so far at all (their mascara is also very poorly formulate/irritating.)",0
Worked perfectly until it released it self and landed on our rubber bath mat. No damage but it now fogs up,0
"We got this product fast and I was excited to try it on my 14 yr old son. I thought since it was an award winner it might be a great product. Maybe for an occasional breakout , but not for moderate acne.",0
This is a quality comb. It is definitely worth the money and I will be buying the smaller one for travel usage as well.,1
"I've used this product for years, purchasing at a local spa. This was my first time ordering the exact same product from Amazon and the consistency arrived much different, watered down and fragrant. This product should be closer to a gel and fragrance free. I believe it may have been diluted or altered.",0
THE best.,1
"I loved my Clarisonic Mia - until it no longer held a charge three months after I bought it. I called Clarisonic, and once I gave them the serial number on the bottom of the handle, they wanted nothing to do with me. They said that it was not one of theirs, and asked where I purchased it. When I told them Amazon, they informed me that neither Amazon nor its resellers were authorized Clarisonic dealers and they could provide no further assistance. They also said that Amazon resellers are creating similar products and seling them with the Clarisonic name and, despite the fact that my Mia came in a CIarisonic box, it was not the real deal. I called Amazon and they didn't really care that resellers are selling non-authentic goods. They suggested I call the reseller and even offered to do so on my behalf. I took them up on it, and will find out in 1-2 business days whether I am eligible for a replacement (which is doubtful since the two month time frame for returns has expired). When the customer service agent asked if I was satisfied, I said ""No, because Amazon is selling pirated goods at that's illegal."" She reiterated that it was a reseller, not Amazon, so I responded ""OK. Then I'm not satisfied because Amazon is allowing its resellers to sell pirated goods and that's illegal."" So I will wait to hear what the reseller says. Please avoid my mistake in purchasing this product from Amazon.",0
Fabuloso,1
"Very good dryer, switches could be sturdier but overall very good.",1
They must have changed the color and formula: doesn't stay on and the color is nothing like it used to be.,0
I tried this after reading other rave reviews.  My skin became red and blothcy and itched enough to wake me up in the night. I don't know if it reacts with other products in my regimen but my skin isn't overly sensitive and I didn't change anything else.,0
does not work as good as matrix,0
Really liked this product.,1
This product is definitely not waterproof. The first day I got it I put it on and a couple hours later it was off. I didn't cry and I was not outside so there was no reason for it to come off. I do the wing tip on my eyes so it's important for the eyeliner I use to be waterproof or it will come off on its own. I bought this product because it said it was waterproof/smudge proof. It's neither and am very disappointed. I'll stick to the Mac liquid liner which is definitely waterproof.,0
Gentle cleaner with foam . Highly recommend to sensitive skin user,1
My wife and daughter loves it.,1
"I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a ""croap"" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the ""Marco method"" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most ""feminine"" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",1
I love it! The scent lasts a long time.,1
"too complicated,",0
"You really have to be careful with this product- or at least, I do, with my super fine hair. The product is not supposed to weigh hair down, but no matter how lightly I try to spray this product, it makes my hair go totally limp and oily looking. The only way I can use it is to lightly spray it on a paper towel and *lightly* rub that on my hair. Then it works fine.",1
"Pretty color,but chipped after only 2days. Drys fast!",0
"Nail Envy Original is great product to protect nail plate and make them healthier. It won't make miracles, but what it does is protects nail plate by covering them, covers imperfection and makes applying the nail polish easier and it looks nicer. I used the product as directed in the enclosed paper. Apply on the clean nails and repeat application every other day or apply as a base coat.",1
"This product is advertised for all hair types.  I'm African American and my natural hair is soft, curly when I let it dry naturally and straight/wavy when I blow it dry or dry in rollers.  This softens my curls too much and leaves them limp, which is not something I want when I want curls.  In other words it loosens the curls too much.  It does smell good and leaves the hair soft, but messes with the curl factor.  So I use it when I want my hair straighter, not curlier.",1
The product itself works fairly well but the smell and chemicals honestly make me sick to my stomach! Inhaling this stuff can't be healthy. It's like a very strong hairspray.,0
This was a lifesaver for my newborn son's baby acne! I applied with cotton balls in the morning and evening. Cleared up very quickly. Very surprised! -NICU nurse for 6 years and new mom,1
"Just a friendly warning.  I purchased this less than two months ago.  (outside of the return window by 2 days)  I have never had it even near the hottest setting and have never left it on for more than a half hour.  The purple paint on the clip all bubbled up and now drops chips of purple paint the size of coarse ground pepper all into your hair and all over your clothes.  It is useless and I guess I will just throw it out.  Please take my advice, I have never written a review before but feel compelled to let people know about this.",0
"I usually buy one every six months, and use it almost daily.
Nice clean scent, effective odor protection that doesn't burn and it lasts and lasts!",1
I must've been sent an old bottle because what I received came out looking greenish. Even when I applied it to my skin it had a greenish tint to it.  Not like other self tanners I've received. It didn't smell bad which was good but I'm worried about the discoloration of the product itself.,0
"I have used this product in the past and it works, however the scent is very strong my husband could barely stomach it.",1
Awesome stuff!!,1
Amazing product!,1
Didn't work for me!,0
"This is not the same Nioxin I had purchased a few years ago.  All of the premium ingredients including the DHT inhibitors have been removed.  What you are left with is nothing more than overpriced Suave.  Will be returning for a full refund.  If you want growth stimulation, get Rogaine for $15 a month.",0
"Good coverage, but hard to get off clothes.",0
I regret spending so much money on this hairdryer.  It stopped working after 10 months.  I will never buy a Chi product again.,0
"I LOVE this stuff. I put it on lightly with a flat top brush zero on areas of face that need it and it doubles as a foundation/concealer. Not heavy at all and very natural looking, amazing coverage, stays on well. I got too dark a color this time though so I'll try lighter next!",1
Didn't give me smooth waves at all,0
Great price and works great on my eye lashes.,1
"This is a product review only. I purchased this from the Kate Spade store. It was sealed in plastic, but upon opening I found 2/3 of a bottle of perfume and bottle looks old. I usually buy the larger bottle so beware this size may be defective. I love the sent. Not worth returning.",0
"Does not hold hair in position at all and I do not like the ""floor cleaner"" scent.  Overall, I am very disappointed",0
"I love using this prior to bedtime. It's not greasy, and it makes my skin more supple. I use it mainly on my hands and neck.",1
I did like the product but it has broken less than a year after I bought it. Not worth it when other brands have lasted me years.,0
Such an amazing beautiful highlight awesome prices well for the quality can be used as highlight eyeshadow inner corner highlight and highlighting collarbones and shoulders a staple in any makeup lovers kit and also a great gift,1
I really exited to use this product but sadly it came to me with a very crash top.,0
"It's good, but I don't see an expiration date on the product, and it concerns me.",0
awesome product,1
"Great hair spray, lightly perfumed, and softly effective hold...I really hate having to use hair spray at all, I'm comfortable with this.",1
"At first I thought it was a great product, because my hair stylist has it on me at one time. Unfortunately my feelings towards it changed within a couple days. I started to notice white flakes in my hair and assumed it was from the product, but just to be sure, I switched back to my old product and nope, no flakes. So with that by itself, I threw it away. Maybe it's just my hair but this is just from personal experience. I like to fix my hair throughout the day because it tends to lose shape. I'm a guy with straight, inch to 1 1/2 in hair on top. When I would run my hands through my hair to kind of give it a messy look, the white stuff would come out and would disgusting almost. I actually just washed it out one time at work because it didn't look appealing. But like I said, it might have just been a personal thing.",0
"no i would not recommend this product. it does not perform as advertised. more words is requested to post this comment,,,",0
"Received on time,  product is as promised",1
Very stylish and lightweight. Heats up quickly and has a nice long salon cord.,1
Not too good,0
The tube that this product comes in broke after only a few weeks.  the lipstick would not go down and now it's a mess.  I would save my money and not purchase this product.,0
"Love it, doesn't pull my hair, swivel cord. My hair looks shinny, and really straight, still learning how to monouver with it to make curls, and wavy hair.
Totally recommend it",1
Works great,1
"This is what I ordered, but there packages are marked wrong!  Instead I rec'd Moi Moi hair masque??  The sticker on the product says that it is the L'anza Healing colorcare silver  brightening??",0
"Great for styling short hair, just can't comb it afterwards so make sure you get it right",1
"Finally! A product that stays on all day!!! It goes on evenly and flawlessly, is silky smooth, blends well and is long lasting. You don't need much for complete coverage. This is now my go-to, I use it as a foundation or tinted moisturizer. It is more than I spend on any other makeup but worth every penny.",1
"Doesn't help with softness, manageability or hard water build up.  Useless product.  The shampoo and conditioner are good though, stick with those.",0
Good,1
"Arrived completely broken, it is just dust. Not Sure how to upload a picture.",0
Broke :(,0
excellent,1
"I've bought Clarisonic Facial Brushes before, and this was just as it should be. Use it everyday.",1
much cheaper than buying it from the dermatologist. works just as well for about 1/2 the price son loves it for his face.,1
i used this product on my private area and it made me go bald!!!!!!! All my pubic hair is gone. Awful product.,0
So disappointed in this polish.  It says apply two thin coats.  I have applied three and I still have brush marks and spotty coverage. It definitely doesn't look like a gel polish.  I went out and bought a cheap drug store variety and it has much better coverage.  I am not sure this is really OPI.  Beware!!,0
"This shaving soap has grown on me since I ran out of the Omega and started using it more. I find the scent pleasing and the shave satisfying. Definitely a great shave, worth the 10 bucks.

For those who don't know this soap has a new formula as of 2012 that removed some of the more questionable chemicals in the ingredients. I'm not sure of the other changes made, as I never used the old formula, being relatively new to shaving soap in tubs.

The same was done to Omega, except I don't believe Proraso mades Omega any longer. I used to like the Omega's scent but the more I used this stuff the more I found the Omega's scent too strong. They both shaved very similarly. The new version of the Omega I did not like and threw out.  I kept this stuff.

After trying a few other brands, I must say that this soap is a good bang for the buck at 10 bucks or less. Pleasing scent. Good Shave.  I still prefer the following brand over Proraso though:

Taylor of old Bond Street's various shave creams. I can get a shave with less cuts while being more aggressive and fast with the shave.  I've tested this many times. Because it's a cream it's applied in very small amounts to the badger brush compared to a more vigorous circular swirling of the brush with the soaps like Proraso. There are numerous scents to choose from. I suppose a fair comparison though would be Proraso's Shaving Cream in the Tube with this brand, but I already have enough shave cream/soap to last a couple years here. :)

For traveling when I want to toss the shave soap into a hot car, or when I want about the strongest menthol cooling effect I've come across in shaving soaps, glycerin based soaps like Mama Bears/Awakenings Mentholated shaving soap are what I toss into the suitcase, as it does not melt and turn into a mess in a hot car.. stays nice and solid, ready for use. :)  It's shave it comparable to Proraso, slightly thinner maybe, very strong cooling effect if you order the Mentholated one.

I see no reason to try any other brands outside these three. Pick what works best for you and go from there. Life's too short to not enjoy your shave to it's fullest.",1
"I ordered this twice and its so good i think my mailman stole it because i never received it..im sad about it but i still wanted to explain why this is such an incredible steal of a buy. Everyone knows there are drugstore makeup and name brand makeup products..the difference is not only price but also quality..when you can buy a lorac palette at a drugstore price point, it is like the stars have aligned and the gods are smiling down from heaven giving you a chance to buy a palette maybe you wouldn't buy at a normal lorac price (40ish bucks). Lorac shadows are absolute butter..by butter i mean blendable like no drugstore eyeshadow ever could be..the fact that they are all matte, includes a bronzer and a blush is just a bonus..if you are thinking about this, buy it now before its too late..limited edition items sell out fast and for 19.00 honestly im surprised they are in stock even now..beginner friendly in my opinion..perfect addition to any makeup collection..i may have to try ordering again because third time may be a charm! I know its hard to incorporate name brand cosmetics into your routine if you normally don't but i promise you it is so worth it to dabble here and there when deals like this come along..i started my collection with all drugstore then ventured my way into experimenting with other brands..if you love makeup id buy this..also would make a beautiful gift..if anyone decides to purchase based on my review id really love to know! Thanks to amazon because this deal is only available here!",1
"the smell is okay...does not dry my skin...but so far, i have not noticed any improvement for the bumps on my body...as happens all too often...the reviews on amazon get me to buy the product only to be disappointed again.  i bought the product with high hopes to finally improve my skin...but did nothing for me.",0
Good one but not perfect. Does not guarantee in 100% shiny fluffy hairs.,1
Smells bad,0
"Up there with my favorite preshaves... and that says a lot. Not too thick or thin, seems to do a nice job softening the beard while I prepare the cream/soap and sink. Will buy again.",1
"Tried it, it did not work!!!",0
I didn't care for this scent although it is a fresh clean scent but a bit too masculine smelling for me.,0
"This used to be my go-to foundation because it was easy to apply, felt good (high quality), and the color looked great with my skin tone.  Then we had some other expenses so I decided to try some of the cheaper options found on the ""top drugstore products"" lists.  After a few of those, none of them were as nice as LG, so I was excited to go back. HOWEVER, they've changed it--THE QUALITY OF THE MAKE UP IS NOT AS NICE.  It feels cheaper, doesn't go on as well. So disappointing!!  I'll be trying a different higher end brand!",0
"I have been looking for a cheaper alternative to Wen for quite a while.  This product received a high rating on totalbeauty.com, and while I really wanted to like it,  I found it left my scalp dry and irritated.  On the plus side, I really like the bottle shape (I hate pumps) and the fragrance was fresh and pleasant-smelling.
NOTE:  I have a lot of fine hair with a bit of a wave to it.  I have to wash it every 2-3 days or else it becomes greasy.  I color my hair every 4-6 weeks and highlight it every 12 weeks.  I prefer to use a cleansing conditioner because it provides just the right amount of conditioning without weighing it down.",0
Great product,1
I purchased this to go along with the shampoo and conditioner. This products smells fresh and clean but ultimately does nothing for my hair. Left my hair still feeling dry and tangled. Will not purchase again.,0
I love this spray! I notice a difference in volume when I use this as compared to when I don't. Especially when I used it along with the mousse.,1
Brush has two different depths & bristles.  Hard to get used to the odd brush.  Took multiple coats to get good coverage.,0
I love this product. It smells fantastic but it unfortunately arrived with a broken cap.,0
"This is NOT Lorac! I went to Ulta to buy the same foundation because this stuff was NOT IT. It was simple to apply but when it dried it was SUPER sticky. I came off pretty easy. I would not recommend this to anyone. I also told the lady at Ulta who was doing my foundation match about this and she stated Lorac DOES NOT permit Amazon to sell their product. So the company that is selling this, is scamming people. Just an FYI. Amazon is great, but this company is not.",0
Awesome!!!  I purchase this for my teen and it works really well. Love these products!,1
"I purchased this from vikistore, and found that it is a counterfeit product.  Of course, I found out AFTER it stopped working.  Amazon should revoke this person's ability to sell products.  This should not be happening on amazon.  Very disappointed.",0
I saw the difference first time I used it. I will continue to see where it takes me after a little while longer use.,1
MY WIFE LOVES IT.....,1
I purchased it 2 years ago and is by far still the best flat iron i have ever owned  i will never purchase another brand!!!!,1
Complete system is great for oil and breakout control.  Must use daily or not very effective.  No greasy feel; nice Spa- ish scent,1
Doesn't burn--didn't cause me to break out--but IT DOES CONTAIN PARABENS--a lot of them.  I'm going to stop using it since I don't want cancer-causing agents all over my face.,0
"I only ""hate"" this because I suffered two severe dermatitis attacks after using this product. Otherwise, I really wanted to love it - it really evened out my skin tone on my pale legs and arms and I trusted Elta more because my dermatologist always recommends them. So this is strictly a warning for those of you with truly extra sensitive skin and/or dermatitis/eczema issues. The first time I used this on my legs and arms two months ago, both my upper arms were covered in a rash, but my legs were fine. A few days ago, I used it on my legs and feet only and developed very severe dermatitis on my hands and one of my feet.  It's been a very painful price to pay, so I highly recommend test-spotting this first if you are prone to problems.",0
Burns so bad feels like acid on my face fr. They're making me add more words but that's all I gotta say dang,0
It works well but the smell is too strong I stopped using it.  For the price you can find something better.,0
"Product would be best for those with white skin and peach undertones.
Light beige is more muddy looking than the picture suggests.
I honestly would not recommend this brand for persons of color. If that is not you, it is a five star product.",1
This got such good reviews and I was so disappointed in it. Doesn't curl well at all.,0
"Didn't notice any tan from using this product, would not recommend this. Just use the tanning mousse instead.",0
"The shaft of this product broke after 2 months of use. I've had hotel toothbrushes last longer! Customer service has been a nightmare, ignoring calls and emails and forcing me to set up an account  go to their site, find my warranty number and oh, the page won't load. I have spent over two hours of my life trying to get a replacement. Next time, sticking with a 5 for $1 pack from the dollar store.",0
Seems to work well on my arms and legs.,1
"Well. Other reviewers definitely right. You don't need a lot at all. A little goes a long way. This is gonna last forever. I do like how my face feels after. It feels... Clean! It does dry out my face, but I'm not concerned because I moisturize right after. I feel like the dryness basically cleaned out my pores and that's why it feels so clean.",1
This is a 30 pack of single use facial cleansing cloths specifically designed for quick and effective make-up removal around the eyes. Each cloth is thick and well sized to wipe over your face and neck several times if necessary. The cloths are infused with chamomile and aloe extracts (as well as 'pure Icelandic glacial waters' according to the packaging) giving it a refreshing herbal scent. The product does indeed feel good on tired eyes with an initial cooling sensation and lingering moisturizing effects that will certainly perk up a tired appearance.,1
Is doing the job .awesome,1
love it,1
Was great while it lasted but after a month the top broke off and was not repairable.,0
"I hate the color, looks nothing like it did when advertised.",0
"Was not what I expected did not like at all not worth the money! But smells really good, and is creamy",0
"This is a nice moisturizer for my face and it makes my complexion look a little brighter. It doesn't take much of this serum to apply an even coat on my face. The fragrance is pleasant, a nice floral scent and it doesn't stick around for long. My skin is very dry and at first it would soak this lotion right up. I feel like my skin is more moist and supple now, and the lotion isn't getting sucked into my skin quite as fast. It did sting a little bit the first few days I used it, but that sensation has been gone ever since. My complexion looks more vibrant and less worn or tired, so MEG 21 Cell Therapy seems to be doing its job for me.",1
This is not Cosmedix Phytoclear!!!!,0
"I had this flat iron for about 4 years.  I used it pretty regularly.  I would say maybe 4-5 times a week, less in the summer.  I loooved this straightener!  It worked so well.  The only problem is that after about 3.5 or 4 years, it just stopped working.  Now I don't really know if this is a good amount of time or not, as this was really my first brand name straightener that I ever had.  Maybe that is a good length of time.  I was disappointed, but realized that maybe I got so much use out of it that its time was simply up.  I decided to try a Chi and am definitely sad that I didn't go back and get another Paul Mitchell.  This one just seemed to work better.",1
used it for six weeks didn't notice any difference at all in my skin except for more breakouts than typical--your face feels clean and tingly after use but didn't do anything for me realistically.,0
"This made my hair really dry and ""straw like"" it also does not spray on clear like advertised. It leaves white powder spots.",0
Like many others I only received three of the patches from my order of six. I have LOVED everything else I have tried from this brand and was looking forward to trying these.,0
Amazing! Does the job wonderfully! I'm a lifer now!,1
"This is super cool looking however it leeks and it's very hard to get a spray perfume into the funnel. I put an o-ring around the screw on sprayer and that stopped the leek. Also, the glass inner vial broke free of the metal exterior and that had to be supe rglued so that I could unscrew the sprayer. Overall WAY overpriced (even though it is super cool looking) the flo atomizer is way better and more reasonably priced. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004V904J8/ref=sxr_rr_xsim1_a_it?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=2286650982&pf_rd_r=C2NWFGYWHPQ8XZTAFN1Y&pd_rd_wg=rz4d7&pf_rd_s=desktop-rhs-carousels&pf_rd_t=301&pd_rd_w=And4Z&pf_rd_i=flo+atomizer&pd_rd_r=P32N1ZP8NCBZ0A1R94Y1&ie=UTF8&qid=1471525617&sr=1",0
"Don't but this product..... unless you're desperate like I was lol
There are so many things wrong with this straightener!
First of all... in the beginning it's okay BUT your hairs will get caught and pulled by the corners and sides of the flat iron. Second, when you use it and close the iron to straighten your hair it doesn't close flat plate against plate. It is uneven and badly made. And lastly, it breaks in literally after 5 uses.
It just starts to get looser and looser and eventually it snaps in half. The screws literally come out.
Don't waste your money on this I've bought better off brand straighteners from Ross and TJ Max!
WORST PRODUCT EVER",0
"Beautiful....smooth, long-lasting",1
I have exema and very dry skin....This really is the best I have found,1
Did nothing - would not purchase it again.,0
"It smelled super weird.. I used to have one but it never smelled like that or even looked like it
 Something was off about this product.",0
This curling iron is so disappointing to me based on all the great reviews. First thing I noticed was it didn't he and hold the curl as good as I thought it would secondly it nearly burns your thumb and lastly the cord it's a tangled mess. And no auto off switch really?? Would not buy again,0
These products are so pleasant to wear and smell so good,1
Good but dries out my scalp.,1
This color just screams summertime my clients and my entire nail salon love this product it is very easy to use it goes on smooth does not streak or clump it is 100 percent perfection I will buy all the colors real soon for my nail salon thank you,1
I used this for about 5 months.  Made my hair feel thicker but didn't add any hair to my head.,0
Works great and great buy!,1
Broke out,0
"The best conditioner for very dry, coarse, or damaged hair.  Use with warm and massage into hair.",1
"Leaves my hair greasy and waxy, regardless of how many times ive attempted to wash it all out. will be returning ASAP.",0
"Lovely neck cream.  Helps to smooth and moisturize skin so it looks lifted (you really didn't think a cream could really lift anything, did you?)  My only negatives are the price and the fact that it comes in an open jar, which is a) not sanitary and b) allows what antiaging ingredients that are in the cream to oxidize.  Not sure I will repurchase as a result.",1
"Yeah, basically what everyone else is saying. I have had mine for a month now, and it's pretty freaking great, haha.",1
"Great cover, light weight.
Love it!",1
This stuff is fantastic!  I've even started giving bottles to family and friends.,1
"This was much more oily than I expected, based on other reviews. I have been looking for a moisturizer with SPF that doesn't leave me feeling super greasy and this was no exception. I have used beauty oils before, and love them, but this does not absorb into my skin. I've started using it on my body, just to use it up. Two stars for sun protection, but not grease-free for me.",0
"Love this stuff! I have curly hair and good shampoo is hard to find. Set at a good price, too.",1
This product is amazing.  I use it right out of the shower on my face.  I use it as a makeup setting mist. It just sets everything in place.  It is cost effective.,1
It doesn't hold that we'll and it makes my crackle. The goo that comes out is very sticky. Not for me. :(,0
THIS PURIFY TYPE IS NOTHING LIKE THE OTHER PUREOLOGY SHAMPOOS.  IT IS CLEAR COLOR AND MY HAIR FELT SO DRY IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET DANGLES OUT.  ALMOST ONE THE OF WORST SHAMPOOS I HAVE EVER USED.  I AM GOING BACK TO THE OTHER FORMULA.  DID NOT LIKE THIS AT ALL,0
I love this mascara,1
"Arrived with burned styling product on the plates, thus is obviously used. Even worse, it doesn't even turn on.",0
"Great stuff. A little on the sweet side almost a little perfumy but. Last a long time which i like. I combine another scent to it to tone down the sweet smell. Also the bottle leaked a little on it's way to me, that was a concern of mine from reading the reviews about that issue.",1
"I love this night cream! It keeps my skin hydrated, soft and wrinkle-free.",1
"I bought this along with negligee, top coat and cream puff and my nails were gorgeous after just one coat of all. I did a double coat of cream puff and the negligee and found it was better to just do one coat of all. I applied it in the following order: 1.base coat 2.cream puff 3.negligee 4.top coat. I cured it in between each coat and only used alcohol after the base coat and after the top coat. I also did a friends nails and it looked very professional and shiny. I also did my toes about a month ago and had no chipping yet. I had to send the dryer back because I had a problem with it so I'm waiting to redo my toes and they're holding out really good. My hands only lasted a week but that's because I was cleaning and it chipped. But it's better than paying 50 dollars every two weeks!! Removal was easy and my nails were not damaged at all.",1
I loved it but wouldnt purchase it again unless its on a discount,1
Japonesque Mini Travel Jar are indeed small. was hoping they where made out of glass... not a big fan of plastic and what not. they do work good.,1
Best hair dryer I've ever owned.  Super quality and dries hair quickly but it is pretty darn loud.  I wish they would make one that was much quieter.,1
I team broken and nail polish all over. Waiting to hear from company.,0
Love this too need no makeup now just blush I am 65,1
"I really loved this stuff at first...it's very light and absorbs quickly. The fragrance is natural and not over powering. But after a week or so, I started to break out like I have never broken out before. My face is still recovering. Such a bummer. I'm not sure which ingredient my face didn't like..I guess I should have looked for a 'non-comodogenic' mark on the package, which I didn't see anywhere. I've never known my skin to be that sensitive, so I guess if a product has ever caused you to break out, maybe be wary of this sunscreen.",0
"I first came across these when I was living in Europe. They are lifesavers when at the beach and great for every day when you need a little freshness. Also for those of you obsessed with your skin like me, water quality is such an important factor that so many people neglect. At the recommendation of my facialist, I began using this (large version) when washing my face and have already noticed visible results in the texture and completion of my skin. Pricey, but worth it.",1
"I bought this mascara because my old one was smearing and flaking onto my skin, and it was impossible to get it all off at night, resulting in raccoon eyes in the morning (or even after a nap). The Blinc mascara comes off easily at the end of the day when I lightly rub my eyes with warm water--no more raccoon eyes in the morning. But it stays on during naps and does not flake off even after a long day (just don't rub your eyes).
It's easy to apply and comes with a normal wand/brush just like any mascara. It does seem especially wet/liquid and sometimes I put on too much and have to use an eyelash comb to separate my lashes before they dry stuck together. It's waterproof in terms of rain or crying, but warm water (such as in the shower) will take it right off. It's pricier than my usual mascara, but so far I like it because of its smudge/flake-proof qualities.",1
Doesn't hold very well. Smells like sandalwood.... Yuck.,0
"I received this is the mail today, and it looked like a dog had chewed it up. Has anyone else a bottle like that of tempu? I buy this all the time and have never had this issue",0
"After using it for a couple of days it made my teeth hurt! I think it destroys enamel! Be careful. It's not for everybody. Didn't work for me.
A KILLER FOR TEETH HEALTH! THIS ACID SHOULD BE BANNED BY HEALTH CARE!",0
Ordered two and both tops were cracked upon delivery.,0
"Nice color, not worth the price.  Made my lips feel like they needed constant re-application.  Won't buy again.",0
Best eyelash curler for short lashes. Love it.,1
My hair has never looked or felt better.,1
Does seem to help with keeping my color from going brassy but it does leave my hair feeling like straw.,1
Don't waste your money! All this product does is put colored powder on your scalp. I can't believe I even bought it - should know by now nothing can make thin hair look thicker except extensions or hair plugs. This is no miracle product so don't buy it!,0
Not as expected,0
"Love the color. I have bought OPI before and it went on glossy and smooth. This product did not, however. Had to out clear over to make it shiny.",0
This is one of the better facial cleansers I've come across in recent times. I've never had any issues with it. Just careful and make sure any third party seller sells you an authentic bottle.,1
I had to purchase one for my college student.  She loved it!,1
This didn't make me any darker.  I followed the directions perfectly and left on for the maximum amount of time and i did not get any tanner.,0
"WAAAAYYY to glittery that its abrasive to my skin. It honestly felt like something you would find in a child's make up kit. Possibly good for a Halloween costume, but I'm not spending that much money on a lipstick for once a year.",0
Does the job....conditioner leaves hair dry....impossible to comb out...I have really long hair......and terrible water.  Otherwise it does the job with repeated washes.,1
"I ordered this in January and waited until my old tube ran out today to open it. I hadn't noticed that the outside reads Hydro Plus moisturizer, but immediately noticed it was the wrong product when I opened and applied it today . Not happy. I love the acidophilus cream but at $70/tube I can't just get another one! Hoping this can be made right.",0
"clicked on wrong one, wanted regular, and after using it really really wanted regular - this one needs the conditioner, which regular does not",0
The brush is very small (almost ridiculously small) and it wasn't any better than a regular top coat. I usually love OPI products but this one wasn't my favorite.,0
I just don't like it :(,0
Pretty dec. Smells like old candy. Not greasy.,1
"I purchased this product because the gradual tanning lotions I purchased at the drug store caused my legs to break out after shaving after a few days of use of the products.  Unfortunately this product did the same thing.  It also streaked even though I was very careful in exfoliating.  I did not think the smell was that bad, though.  I will probably go back to Fake Bake after trying this product.",0
"I lived in Spain for 4 years in my mid-twenties and I had a friend who was in her mid 30s who used this on her face.  Her nickname was ""mueca de porcelana"" which means porcelain doll..not a wrinkle to be found.  I decided to try this cream around 5 years ago and never looked back.  Great for hydration and keeping those wrinkles away!  Everyone I share this product with has fallen in love!
At night, wash your face, use a toner, and then apply the cold cream...and for day use, I do the same and then apply a 50spf basic face lotion over my cold cream (applying from the top down not to clog pores with the sunblock) before I leave the house.
I work in athletics at a university and I'm going on 32 and always get called a student-athlete... :) Enjoy!",1
"So, what little of the product I was able to sample (the teeniest tiny little glop that I was able to spread on HALF of the top of my hand, seemed lovely.  So, I'm sure the product is great.  HOWEVER, that's the extent to what is in this ""sample size"" that cost FOUR DOLLARS.  What a rip off.  This should have been 99 cents, at most.  There isn't enough to cover my face, which is why I purchased it. I wanted to try it as a last-step in my nighttime routine. I won't be able to do that.  Very disappointed. This is priced like a purse-size, and it is not that at all.  This tiny little bottle fits in the palm of my very petite hand, and is mostly empty.  BUYER BEWARE.",0
This product really works.  My eye lids were red & dry.  It doesn't take a lot of this cream.  I use a litte each night & it really works.  Now my teenage daughter has started using in spots that dry out too much due to acne creams.  It works for without being too oily.,1
"I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.

The Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.

Associated gear: Parker 99R safety razor; Boker Tree Brand straight razor; Escali Badger Hair brush; Proraso Green pre-shave.",1
"So fare i can;t say a hole lot it came in time but my nails are still soft and brittle,as my hair hard to say if it has gotten better?",1
Not good. it seems greasy and I do not like to use in the morning when I am so inrush. I will never order again,0
worked great! for a week then fell apart at the seams,0
"I bought this for my wife for Christmas--she loved it and it worked perfectly for 6 weeks and then suddenly it stopped working! We didn't drop it and she used it less than 20 times. I am very disappointed!!  I would consider using this brand again if Amazon accepted a return, however, since it appears they won't take it back (deadline Jan 31), I'm going to purchase a different brand and never use Hot Tools again.",0
"Since most foundations have a maximum of 15 SPF rating its nice to know this skin renewal lotion amps that up to SPF 30.  Where I live in Southern California the sun can be brutal.  The texture of this cream is lightweight and a smal dot goes a long way and it adheres to your skin quickly.  As per the packaging warning there is a slight tingling feeling as you work it into your skin and because of this I hesitate to put it too near the more delicate area around my eyes.  (Im using a separate moisturizer for the under eye area).  Though the results aren't dramatic I can feel my skin plumping slightly.  Sometimes I use it on its own and other times I use it under my foundation.

It dispenses with a pump which makes it easy to control the flow so you can precisely get just a small amount so nothing is wasted.  This seems important since this product is not at a drugstore price point.  Ive only been using it for a week so Im not sure if the results justify the cost but the way it plumps my skin, provides a higher protective SPF, and how soothing it feels Im liking it.",1
You get a great and close shave.  It also lasts a while as you don't need much each time to get a close shave,1
"But had to use this AND the color conditioner EVERY day.  The condition HAD to be used each day.  Also grew weary of getting it colored every 4 to 6 weeks (my wife first tried Just For Men and THAT took hours to do), then I went to a professional and just wasn't willing to pay $50.00, which included the tip, each month so let it go completely gray.  Have had MORE compliments on the gray than on the brown coloring AND the way the shampoo made my hair look.",0
"Works good, but not sure it is the best.  Still looking.",1
Wish it got a liiiiiittle hotter!,1
Not impressed!  Wouldn't waste my money on this.,0
BEST LOTION I HAVE FOUND.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT,1
"Es muy bueno, protege muy bien del sol y deja tu piel ligeramente rosa, con un brillo saludable luego de un da de playa.  Resulta ideal para pieles grasas, pero no para m. Despus del uso diario dej mi piel muy deshidratada.

This is a very good product, it protects very well from sun damage and leaves a light pink tone and glowing efect after a beach day .
I think it is perfect for oily skin. After a daily use, it let me dehydrated skin.",1
This product did not work for either myself or my daughter. Not stiff enough to hold hair and it wouldn't stay without using a ton of bobby pins...exactly what we were trying to get away from using. Would not recommend.,0
I really love this toner. It makes your skin feel fresh and clean. I have rosacea and this toner is gentle enough to not irritate my skin at all while still leaving it feeling clean and toned.,1
"It has a pungent smell to it. I thought i would like it since i love the sexy hair soya want flat hair, but this was bad. It has a smell and leaves my hair sticky and not completely flat.",0
"I have very healthy, but short hair, so it grows fast and gets really thick.  When that happens, my hair feels rough and dry.  This product is amazing.  I recently forgot I had some from my hairdresser and my hair looks sooooo much better....smooth, shiny!  This way I can go a little longer without getting my haircut so often because the silk infusion will make it look super!  Thanks for the great deal, too!",1
These are amazing at tacking off glitter nail polish. I just don't like how expensive they ended up being.,1
"Lorac's True Red is a beautiful red lipstick. It feels very soft and light on the lips and stays on for awhile, but I do need to reappply after eating and drinking. I received several compliments on this color. I would say this color wouldlook great on all skin type.",1
"Im a longtime Clarisonic fan, though I use it weekly, rather than daily, as it can be a bit too much for my sensitive skin. The Luna 2 is a similar idea, with a significantly different set-up.

Like the Clarisonic, its a vibrating, rechargeable cleanser, but instead of a round, changeable bristle brush, this little hockey puck a built-in silicone scrub head. I don't think the wide base is quite as easy to handle as the Clarisonic handle, but it is submersible and the battery lasts far longer between charges.

The much more gentle massage is also totally suitable for daily use, so Ive got this one in the shower to use every morning, and am keeping my Clarisonic to use with deep cleaning masks and for weekend facials.

Im skeptical of the reverse side anti-aging massage as it mostly just felt like holding a vibrating cell phone to your face  not unpleasant, but hardly useful  but, all in all, the Luna 2 definitely makes my skin feel softer and cleaner than washing alone and its compact size and long-lasting battery make it an easy-to-use addition to my daily routine.",1
"This product makes my face peel. Cant use unless I want to go without makeup for the next few days. My skin is not sensitive usually, but this stuff makes it get outta town",0
"I like it and it seems to work, although I find it a bit drying for my skin especially in winter time",1
"This scrub is just okay. It smells great and leaves my skin soft, yet there isn't enough exfoliant (strawberry seeds) in it to thouroughly exfoliate my skin.
The creamy,  whipped consistency is nice and feels more like you're cleansing with cold cream than actually using a scrub.
I found myself really struggling to collect up strawberry seeds for the areas that needed exfoliating, mostly my chin and nose.
The results are lackluster at best, but the cream really does make your skin feel soft and moisturized even if it doesn't feel exfoliated.
I wouldn't recommend this for someone who needs a decent amount of exfoliation on a consistent basis.",1
Great Product.. Great Shipping Thanks...,1
It help to my skin,1
"I am in love with L'Occitane's product line for skin. I get a tube of this every Holiday season to help with my dry, cracked hands & elbows.
You'll need the ""MAGIC KEY"" to empty these containers&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Magic-Key-Press-Tub/dp/B0041M5VXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Magic Key - Press Tub</a>&nbsp;to the last drop

It is a heavier moisturizer and a bit greasy until it absorbs properly, however it is mild and does not cause burning on open cracks. It helps heal, and prevent (if I remember to use it) the dryness associated with winter & wind.

The scent is quite pleasant as well.

The biggest con is the tube, which is made of metal(aluminum?). I heard they are working with a company to release environmentally green tubes. However, until those are released you'll have trouble emptying these till the last drop. L'Occitane makes a special ""key"" to roll it properly, but I think it should be included with every tube purchase given the cost of the product, and I think the key price is a bit much also.",1
"NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  THE REGULAR JANE IREDALE MASCARA, THOUGH NOT LENGTHENING, IS MORE GENTLE ON THE EYES.  THIS DOES NOT GIVE THICKER LASHES AND IRRITATES THE EYES.",0
Not as good as the gel you use with a light but last longer then regular polish. Cool colors,0
"Ordered light blonde received what appeared to be light green, tried it twice and both times it looked terrible. I wasted my money but at least I ws smart enough to purchase the smallest trial size for less than $ 7.",0
"Even though my color choice was a little off,this product met my expectations. It was easy to apply & stayed in throughout the day. I thought it was a little pricey,but the container is a good size & will last a long time. I would buy it again.",1
I don't know why they changed the old formula.  It was much better before....,0
I received a sample of this perfume in a Birchbox. It's the first perfume in a long time that I have really liked. I read another review that stated the scent wasn't the same but to me it has the same scent as my sample.  I was also pleasantly surprised at how much actually comes in the tube.  Definitely will re-order and recommend.,1
"Perfect amount of sparkle to add to any base color. A bit difficult to take off, but that's to be expected. In the photo it's on top of 2 layers of Butter London's Kip.",1
"It works. However, I get a lot of frizz. FYI

PS: Fiance",1
recieve my bottles shattered!,0
It stopped working within 2 months,0
"La Roche-Posay knows skin.
From the first application, it seemed to melt some of those little laugh lines around my eyes.
It might seem expensive, but each eye takes only one tiny droplet. Gently pat around the eye area. That delicate skin is smooth and even has a lifted feel. Sometimes I put a drop or two on my neck as a skincare treat.",1
I didn't realize when I bought this product that there is a boycott movement against AHAVA products.  One should read about it before deciding whether or not to purchase this product.,0
Good,1
Doesn't work that well.. soo want a refund.. ,0
Love this product.,1
Ive been using this product for over 2 weeks and not seen any changes. I would not recommend it.,0
Been using this for several years now and is my favorite face wash. Just hope they continue to produce it and don't discontinue it like some of my other favorite Glytone products.,1
It smells really nice with a clean and light scent. I don't really think it's making my skin any more moisturized but I usually so much lotion I'm not sure I would be able to tell the difference. I didn't think I could go without lotion just from using this shower oil. I wasn't sure if I should use this shower oil instead of body soap or in addition to it. I think the price is pretty steep for what it is. I can buy 3 bottles of another brand of body soap for this price. I also wasn't sure how to apply it since it doesn't lather and won't really go on a loofa. I think it is for this reason (can't put it on a loofa) that I tend to use more shower oil than I would body soap. Overall I've enjoyed the smell of the product and using it but I think it's overpriced.,1
Love this palette! Quality carries on just as u expect from any product from The Balm. Only doing 4stars instead of 5because the pans are kinda small. I'll be going through this kinda quick. But I love the colors and brush it comes with,1
This is one of the greatest products I have used. I love the whole Melu line. My hair feels and looks better than ever.,1
My nails are thin and brittle and hoped for a solution.  This did not help.  In order to take it off requires acetone - which is lethal to already weakened nails.,0
This is a good treatment but did not cure my frizzies as I had hoped.  I thought it would get better after using it for awhile but it did not.,0
"If you don't want a greasy oily beard then this product is for you. I thought it was something more like a conditioner that left no residue, instead I would describe it more like a very mild control gel for your beard.",1
"Smells like dirt, poor lather that dries up very quickly. There are a lot of ways to save $10 in life, but this shouldn't be one of them. Spring for something better.",0
"Color that came is a green color, not the burnt orange color shown. Color itself isn't bad, BUT that isn't what I wanted.",0
Weird texture and smell. My hair feels dirty after I put some of these powder on..like I haven't washed it in days and its full of dirt/gunk. Returning product.,0
Do not buy this!  I had it for a little over 2 months and the black coating started to flake off. It's really a mess now and can't be used. The beauty supply store will not take it back even though it's clearly defective.,0
Worked great on my hair,1
Expensive.,0
"I didn't like the smell of this cream, at first - but now I love its unique scent! The cream, itself, is thick and almost gelatinous: a little goes a long way. Its so silky, absorbs into the skin well, and feels wonderful.",1
Easy to use and makes hair shiny.  I have thick shoulder length hair with some curl.  Strong enough dryer to dry as it styles damp hair.,1
"This, in combination with OPI's Envy, has made my nails exponentially stronger...and in just two weeks!! Thank goodness...I was getting desperate!!",1
"It is a shame that in order to write a review you have to give a product at least one star. This piece of crap sparked, stopped working, and smelled like an electrical fire after owning for only a couple of months. I have never owned a hair dryer that didn't last AT LEAST a couple of years. I would not recommend this to ANYONE!! It does not deserve even one star.",0
"Pretty good cream, but the vessel makes it difficult to use the soap with a bowl & brush - if you use a wet brush to try to scoop some up, it leaves water in the jar.",1
"I have has this curler for about a year and have used it on my hair, my sister's hair and my mom's hair. All three of use have thick hair naturally, but my mom and I have our hair treated. Today I used my curler to try to recurl a piece of my hair and the curler melted my hair right off! It's not even because I had the curler at full heat (I had the curler at about 380-400 and the max is 430). The curler produces good results but I'm scared to use it again.",0
This is probably the best eye cream I have used.  I've used quite a few and seem to have best results with Anthony.,1
Great smell and leaves my hair so soft,1
It is very sticky and have a bad smell,0
"I love the polish, very good quality and lasts a long time. Doing the whole routine takes a lot longer than 5 minutes though and I am not that patient. I tend to use just the topcoat on my fingers and the pink on my toes. The satin finish is a matte finish and just takes the whole thing back to where you started.  From here on out I will just order the ones I like.",1
This iron does not curl at all. 35.00$ wasted. It does not heat up enough to put a curl in my hair.,0
"This didn't cover my dk circles under eyes, I wish you send me a sample of something that works, I have used so many products don't know if the color match wasn't right for me.",0
Compared to Hollywood transformation face creme it doesn't measure up at all. I would like to return it for full credit.,0
I have used lots of different lip moisturizers but was still left with flaky lips.  This product feels good going on and WORKS! Now my lipsticks go on more smoothly and just look better.  THANKS!,1
"Ceramic and a hot tools product... You can't go wrong. I'm just replacing my 1 of 5 that finally gave out after ten years.

Sums it up :)",1
"If looking for a powder-based dry shampoo, this is a great product.  It blends well and absorbs oil effectively.  Since purchasing this product, I have also tried ""spray"" dry shampoo, which I like better for my hair.  That's the only reason it gets 4 starts out of 5.  Had I not tried the ""spray"" dry shampoo, I would have given it 5 stars.",1
I really love the formula and the packaging is lovely. I wish I loved the color more but its a little too shimmery and the color isn't very rich,0
"but I will order this again if the need arises. The product is very strange. The brush is very strange, but it works. I have had my polish on for two weeks without one chip! Totatly amazing and it will probably last very long as it is like putting on water it is that thin.",1
A jar of goo that doesn't seem to do much for my hair.,0
My fave flat iron!,1
"Smells good. Awesome product. Spray broke on it. Straw broke in half inside. Cant get it open. Bought a second one, did the same thing.",0
"Horrible product and even worst costumer service. It doesn't work, it will burn you, better off to put that $169 towards professional treatments. I would not waste my hard earned money on this device. I have light skin with dark hairs...this product should have worked...but it does not.",0
Smells great,1
"I got this product for my daughter because it had good ratings. Products don't always work the same for everyone, for my daughter it def did NOT work instead it got worst and I feel terrible because no one wants to deal with that. With that being said I will not purchase this product again and I don't recommend it either.",0
The Essential Day Moisturizer smells horrible to me. Wish it were fragrance free.,0
I think that it may be outdated or old. It doesn't not smell at all like my other bottle of Euphoria.,0
"When I ordered this, didn't realize that it was not the butterfly type. Others may like this type, but it seems like a LOT of extra work during changing blades to have to unscrew the head, then line it back up for reassembly. For shaving seems as good as any other razor, but since I have to change blades every other day, it just doesn't work for my ultra busy retired lifestyle, (that bacon isn't gonna fry itself).",0
"Once you've tried one cologne shower gel, you've tried them all. The scent is strong, but the bubbles are slim. No pouf in the world can give you the soapy suds you desire and it never feels like it's doing any cleaning. This is especially true of the Burberry gel.

If you are determined to buy it, I recommend using your usual bar or favorite body wash first so you will actually be clean and then follow up with the Burberry so your skin will smell like a Dillard's Men's Department for the next thirty minutes.

Admittedly I do love the Burberry Brit Rhythm scent. It's conventionally masculine but a step above your typical locker room clich. It's deep and sexual, but not especially overpowering. The gel does not linger on your skin for long, so if you aren't going to follow-up with the cologne itself, you better move fast and get someone in bed because otherwise, no one will notice.

OVERALL: I would never recommend any shower gel that is from a cologne line and do not recommend the Burberry either. They all fail as a cleansing soap, are overexpensive, and, most surprisingly, the fragrance doesn't linger. I do like the scent, though, so if you're shopping around for a new cologne, you might give Brit Rhythm a sniff to see if it fits your needs.",0
"I just tried this -- knowing there is a massive ""smell"" controversy about this brand.  Seems like a great lotion, light and applies without leaving a greasy feeling or chalky complexion.  Sadly, I agree with the detractors -- this stuff smells like the handrail at a nursing home.  And it doesn't fade.  Wait for the ""New & Improved"" version if that ever happens -- then you'd have a winner.",0
Brought for monthly give away and it was the wrong size needed a 1 and 1/4,0
Good,1
Good,1
"I gave this away. It smells nice, but left my hands drier than when I used it.",0
I used to wear liquid foundation but I got sick of having to apply it every morning and all the chemicals in it.  So I gave this stuff a shot and have been wearing it for the past 5 months.  I use a pretty small kabuki brush that does a good job of covering but doesn't look too cakey.  I would say the powder foundation is probably better for people with relatively decent skin because it does show dry flakes and has a tendency to settle into pores a little more than liquid. The other nice thing is that I could never match my foundation to my face exactly and this stuff blends in really well and I think looks really natural once it's mixed with your facial oils a little.  Overall I am really happy with it!,1
"UPDATE:  It had been a while since I broke this stuff out but I thought I would give it another go today.  In the interim, I had purchased a new hairdryer that was painted with this type of soft-touch coating they sometimes put on plastic goods.  Today I tried this product and when I was done I looked down to find my hands bright red.  I looked at my relatively new hairdryer and this stuff had basically dissolved the paint - it was now completely faded and even the print on some of the switches is no longer legible.  I can no longer recommend this product at all due to its potential to damage your equipment.  I have tried other similar products and have had nothing like this happen before.  And this was rather instant and severe degradation.  Definitely due to a chemical they use and something that should have been tested ahead of time.  Boo!  I should note that this did not happen on the other hairdryer I was using so its a coin toss as to whether it will ruin your stuff.

A caveat to this review - I am far from an expert in men hair products.  My experience in this type of product is basically American Crew's Forming Cream and Fiber products and my perspective is largely based on my experience with those two products.

18.21 Paste is pretty thick but sort of melts when you rub it in your hands and then applies rather easily and evenly in your hair.  I personally have been putting it in wet and blow drying my hair to sculpt it the way I want it.  The Paste has a what I can only describe as a feathery hold.  It is closest to the Crew Forming Cream but that tends to remain sticky and can sort of clump your hair together.  Not the 18.21 paste - I can run my fingers through my hair and feel that every strand remains independent and there is no stickiness to the product once dried.

I was amazed that while this product doesn't clump or stuck like the Crew Forming Cream, it does have a pretty darn good hold - not quite as strong but good.  The hold is similar to Crew's Fiber but retains the shine.  I have pretty thick and wavy hair and the fact that this product keeps my hair in place all day is a plus.

My main complaints are these:

1.  The smell is just overbearing in my opinion.  I bought this product from a local salon because it got good reviews here in terms of quality and because I liked the smell of it at the salon and I still like the smell of it.  The problem just is that it tends to fill the room (particularly in the car) and can be a little overbearing.  I was expecting that the scent would be subtle once the product was applied - like you might be able to smell it if you put your nose to my head - but it comes off more like I am wearing tobacco/vanilla cologne the entire day.  After a few hours, I just wanted it out of my nose and it wouldn't go away.  If you have other scents you like to wear, plan on this competing or drowning it out.  I like to enjoy the smell of my food when I eat, but this would get in the way.  Enough said.  It's strong.

2.  When I went to wash this out of my head, it returned to it's paste form when wet and was very, very thick.  I could hardly believe it.  Not even the gel I used in the 80s was this hard to wash out.  Pretty sure I had residual of this product in my hair for 2-3 days.  Normally I wouldn't care all that much but even on day 2, the aforementioned scent was still apparent from time to time.

The bottom line:  Is this product worth a shot?  Yeah, sure.  I particularly like that it is a USA made product and I am always more willing to give those manufacturers a try before I go somewhere else.  If you REALLY like the idea of tobacco/vanilla scent and are not scent sensitive, you might love this stuff.  Personally, I won't be purchasing again if for no other reason than to try some more competing products to see how they go.",0
"My 17 year old granddaughter tried this eyeliner, as it came in black, which is her desired color choice. She said it really worked well on the waterline of her eye, considering that it was a ""pencil"" style (vs. liquid) liner. She was also able to smudge the line on the upper lid to her satisfaction, which gave the liner a ""fade"" affect, as the original line still stayed dark and true. It is definitely great that they include the small sharpener right with the pencil, but I think you probably have to take care while sharpening so that the eyeliner does not break (it is small and thin, which is great for drawing thin lines, but also makes it more fragile and susceptible to breakage). I gave this four stars because I think the price is high compared to other brands that work equally as well at a much lower cost. so I recommend that consumers shop around to find a better value for their money.  Other than that, it was great and looks beautiful.",1
"I don't mind using this, but I just don't see any results after using it daily for a month now. It claims you will see immediate or rapid results, but I haven't even seen any slow results after all this time. The eye cream itself is fine as a light moisturizer and I had no problems with it as far as any irritations. It is like a light cream or a cream serum texture. It absorbs nicely and very quickly with no shiny skin afterwards. Previously I had been using kinerase extreme lift eye and extreme lift face, which are very hard to find now that they've been discontinued, but those do give immediate very noticeable results. I guess I was hoping this iS Clinical would be a good replacement.unfortunately it is not and I cannot justify to continue to purchase it with no results other than just being a decent moisturizer. Theres so many more cost efficient products for that purpose. Also, I do not have any major eye problems.. no deep wrinkles, no terrible under eye bags and I do not have any excessive dark circles. I just have fine crows feet at the corners of my eyes and occasional crepe-y look right under/along  my lower lash line. I also feel like I have some drooping at the corners sometimes. This product doesn't improve any of that, except the tiny crepe lines right along the lower lashing, but any eye cream or moisturizer takes care of that.",0
"I had an allergic reaction to this product. I have used before without issue so after some investigation I discovered my bottle was fake, not authentic! Very disappointed.",0
My dermatologist in Austin recommended this product as she said you should have at least 7.0% zinc oxide in your face moisturizer.  I do use it with another moisturizer but it is reasonably priced and I do feel like my skin is very protected on my face when using this product.,1
Waste of money,0
Very creamy,1
Doesn't work,0
"I read the previous reviews, & usually take negative reviews with a grain of salt, however, they were right on!!!  This product smells like ammonia, is opaque white, and CERTAINLY NOT WEN!!!!  Don't waste your money and time returning it!!!!",0
"While this shower gel does have a great smell, it doesn't seem to clean very well and after using it a few days, it felt like it was starting to dry out my sensitive skin. I would never buy this a gift for anyone or let it replace any of my current body wash.",0
I have been using this product for years and its always had a yellowish tint to it.  This particular products is clear and thinner that usual.  Also the fragrance is not as strong.  Dont think its the real CHI product.  Will try and return.,0
"I wore acrylics for about a year+. OK, they were alot of fun!!!! But then, due to minor fungus, alot of separation, of the older acrylic, and so on,
I had them removed.  My nails were also very soft underneath...
I understood that it would take alot of time to get my normal nail strength back...I just forgot about my age...66. One last blast, huh?  Some are
Ok, the rest weak, and one of my best ...what used to be my best, nails, my middle left finger, splits horizontally, or rather, laterally under the nail.
Therefore, it gets to about 1/3"" and splits.

I am NEVER good about regimes!!! I do this whenI remember. My nail girl, gave it to me...She did NOT rip off the acryllic!  In my irregular usage..it alone is getting stronger...If I just remembered to do them once a day....With a full bottle, maybe I will learn.

Heed the warning...Acrylics for no more than a month... Actually, suffer the lousy nails and see if this works, because Any fingernail enhancer, be it acrylics, gel, or fakes, are out for me for now on.  Meaning, I can no longer do them...Oh, also, watch out for those vertical nail lines from those things...This is alot cheaper, and you already hate your nails...Just do this first for say, 4 months...

Advice from a person who just chose to go for it...",1
"This stuff works great, just done overdo it. Easy does it...
Also, works best on people with thin hair but still a decent amount of hair. If you have actual bald spots, putting on them might be noticeable to others.",1
"If I could have only one nail product, it would be OPI Nail Envy. When I finally purchased it at my local Sally Beauty store, I was beyond skeptical & felt like I was surely throwing my $$ away. By my standards, I thought that nearly $20 for 0.5 ounces of polish is exorbitant. Unlike everything else I've tried, however, it really works, & I noticed a difference within a week's use. I'm so glad the many positive reviews here convinced me to give Nail Envy a try. My only complaint is that I didn't find it sooner!

This is the 1st & ONLY product in 35 years of spending money on various nail hardeners, strengtheners, oils, cuticle creams, oils, dietary chages & oral supplements that has made any difference whatsoever for my chronically weak, splitting, nubby nails! Cuticle overgrowth & cracking has greatly lessened. Polish stays on longer due to less severe nail flexing & bending, which used to cause my polish to start chipping off within hours. I finally have nails I love instead of sad-looking, ragged & embarrassing nails. No OPI or Sally affiliation, just an amazed & happy customer!",1
Good curling iron.,1
"i have used this shampoo and other malibu products for quite some time- they are awesome. previously i purchased from the salon. the product i received from amazon is not the same. the color, consistency, smell of the shampoo and feel of my hair after using were all wrong. i believe i received a counterfeit product. would not recommend.",0
"On cold mornings, I use a hair dryer to warm the product. The heat makes it easier to squeeze the product out of the tube and through the little hole on the top of the cap. Otherwise, the product is so thick at low temperatures, it's darn near impossible to squeeze the product from the tube. Once warm, the product is easier to apply. Perhaps Coola might want to think about developing high-tech packaging that warms the product (Lithium-ion powered?) to make it easy to dispense. Just a thought.",1
Poor quality to me is a scam.,0
"very good for the  neck, but have to use 2 times a day for best results",0
"It really helps, and it doesn't make a mess, since it goes on clear. Helps dry up the spots and makes it all feel better. The small tube is easy to stash somewhere handy.",1
It works! I love this product.,1
"I'd been using this product for a year, when I got a fake. I know it's a fake because my eyelashes thinned out quickly, I also looked at the tube and after reading the other reviews, I see now that it has the Fake name which is Eyelash Formula. So, now I've spent 50+ on something that made me look WORSE than I did when I started using this last FAKE tube. I then had to go purchase something else that worked just as well. IF, and only IF this is fixed in the proper way and I am either reimbursed my monies or I'm sent a REAL tube of Grandelash LASH-MD that works will I use this again. Too bad to lose a good customer by sending a fake. That was 50.00 I didn't find on a tree outside of my home.",0
"This product is great. I have very oily and acne prone skin, and I was skeptical to try something new since I had been using Aveeno skin care for so long and was decently satisfied. I used the face wash and the toner together right away and a couple days later I noticed that my skin broke out like crazy! My skin had broken out in areas where I typically don't break out often, so I was a little scared to continue use.. but I have been to several dermatologists in the past, so I assumed this insane breakout was because I had changed products and my skin was adjusting. For the next week and a half I continued to only use the face wash twice a day to minimize irritation. It's been about two weeks since I started using the face wash on its own and I virtually have no blemishes. It's almost as if that initial breakout was all the impurities being sucked out of my skin and now the cleansing routine just maintains my face clear. My only complaint now is that my face is peeling where I had blemishes two weeks ago, but that's an easy fix with an exfoliant. I also noticed my skin is softer, pores are tighter, under the skin blemishes are more easily extracted, and my face looks overall more even-toned. I would definitely recommend trying this for several weeks to see full results! This is my new favorite skin care brand!!",1
once I used it with the hot hair dryer every thing burned out. please don't spend your money on this .,0
great mositurizing and smoothing conditioning!,1
This is a really nice comb that's well made and which uses high quality materials. It feels good to use no sharp edges or tines. No starchiness. It's nice to look at. It feels substantial without being too heavy. It compares really well against super cheapo combs which tend to break and irritate the scalp. The hard thing about Mason Pearson products is getting clarity on the sizing. This is a little larger than typical pocket combs - it works well for someone who is large and who has big hands. I'm very happy with it. I would not expect everyone to think the extra money is worth it unless they have tried and been injured by cheap sharp combs.,1
"I AM HIGHLY DIDAPPOINTED. Spent $15 on nothing!!! The spray doesnt stay on your hair no longer than two seconds,  its not worth it",0
Needed a sunscreen just started to use it  Feels very light and a small amount goes a long way doesn't feel greasy on my skin,1
"If the color is too dark, you can see it.  Otherwise, it does a great job.",1
It is so hard that it is similar to rubbing a sticky candle or very old wood puddy on your skin.  I expected a smooth glide.  Disappointed.  Maybe they sent me an old one?,0
The best base coat I've found. Will be ordering again.,1
Very disappointed in this product.  It's just concealer.  This wasn't clear to me from the packaging.  The instructions were equally confusing.  Should it be applied at night?  Under make up?  I was unimpressed with the results when my questions were answered.  And it is terribly over priced.  Save your money!,0
I've been buying this product for some time and the price was great along with the quality of the product.,1
"After my initial purchase of Jack Black Beard Oil, I sought out other less expensive beard oils. After all, $25 is a lot of spend on 1 oz. I came back to this product again, though, because it's the only one so far that actually works to soften and straighten this weed growing on my face. The smell is pleasant enough on application and dissipates quickly, and it's easy to apply.

I held back one star, though, because it's just too expensive. They need to offer a larger size at a reduced ""per ounce"" price.",1
Great product my skin feels amazing.  LOVE IT for the price its even better,1
I use Wen products and needed a replacement quickly so I ordered from Amazon. Unfortunately the product I received was not the quality I receive from Wen. It is runny vs gel form. Disappointed.,0
"produce was broken, the spring loaded top was visibly broken.  It appeared defective from as soon as I opened the box.",0
"love this brush, came quick!!!!!",1
"Product works great, I just didn't like the smell... (As in I almost washed it off as soon asi put it on).. But the next time I used it I mixed it w/ the royal Amber and it was much better.,",1
Not really as helpful as the Neuma products,0
this is a fake: it does not smell like the original. While in France I asked and it was confirmed that the Jean Patou brand had been discontinued...,0
Great cloths that work well at removing most things (not caked on mascara) and have no scent. They also firmly snap close to keep moist.,1
Not worth the money.  Felt this product did not do what it claimed.,0
no results,0
"Smells good, but does not lather like other body washes.",0
Good product....fast shipping,1
ARRIVED DAMAGED SO I CANT REALLY GIVE POSITIVE FEEDBACK. .,0
The best sunscreen I have ever used.,1
"I will definitely be buying this again. I use this with Jack Black's True Volume Thickening Shampoo. The two go great together. It makes my hair look like I'm a 90's teen throb. My hair is soft, smooth, and feels and looks great! I would definitely recommend this product. It's worth every penny and a little goes a long way.",1
"got two bottles, so that says alot",1
I have been using this for 1 week now and it seems to work for me. The results are not instant but it works. It does make the fine lines around the eyes look smaller and disappear.,1
"I ordered the wrong size so there it sat for a year and I gave to my mom for the next Christmas...never taken out of package.  She used it once and then it didn't work any longer.  I have not had any problem with any other of my Hot Tools products, just this.  Bummer.",0
"I am 41 and I've suffered from large cystic acne on multiple areas of my neck almost every day for the last 5 or 6 years. It's incredibly painful and debilitating to your morale.  I found myself dreading business trips and face to face meetings with clients because I could not get the acne under control.  I bought this and the MB Buffering lotion as a last ditch effort before going to a dermatologist and I am so glad I did.  For the first time in years I have clear skin with only the occasional bout of acne.  It's wonderful!  You will not be disappointed if you try this.
Usage - I use this every night after washing my face with my regular facial cleanser. I apply the buffering lotion first, then apply the drying lotion. Within three days of starting the regiment my cystic acne was mostly gone.  I have noticed with this product there is excessive drying of skin and it seems like when I apply it too thick it's difficult to get off the next morning, I really have to scrub to remove it.
-- Make sure you do not shake before using.  The sediment should be on the bottom of the bottle, the liquid at the top waters it down a bit, works great.
On a side note, it seems to work well on regular acne also, but I don't get those often and in my opinion the fact that it works on cystic acne is much more impressive.  I previously tried dozens of other products and none of them helped.
I highly recommend this product, I will be using it long term as my acne care solution.",1
"Best shampoo ever and so inexpensive, been using it forever and I don't need to use conditioner with it.",1
"I'm giving this product a 2 out of 5 because as a number of reviews have mentioned, this product contains something that burns my skin when applied. However, this product does in fact leave my skin feeling clean and fresh which functions as advertised; however, FOR ME, the burning sensation makes this product non-compatible with me. Note that the burn decreases gradually as the clay solidifies and does not burn by the time it should be washed off.

A couple years ago, when the packaging for this face mask was clear and not gray, the formula of the mask did not burn my skin. I'm not sure if the company has changed ingredients along with packaging, but this new packaged mask burns my face.

*IF THERE IS NO BURNING, I WOULD RATE THIS PRODUCT 5/5*",0
Been using it for a few weeks and not really noticing a difference.,0
Maybe I need to give this product some more time but what's difficult is that there's no lather so my hair just doesn't feel clear after I wash. Underwhelmed so far.,0
"Great product, good active ingredients, will buy again Thanks !",1
This is not a color depositing shampoo like I thought it was.  The shampoo does not have a fragrance.  It has a smell.,0
Super bummed that this is a travel size. For the price I paid it should be a normal size I would have thought.,0
"While this brush may indeed work wonders on your skin I ended up throwing it in the trash. It only holds a charge for a minimal amount of time and it takes more than 12 hours to recharge. It was just too frustrating to keep. Buyer beware. There are much cheaper versions that couldn't possibly be any worse as far as holding a charge and besides, this item is made in China.",0
"This is a good spray, and I feel like it definitely protects my hair when I use my GHD iron, however it has a very sweet, strong scent that I don't like.  It's a vanilla scent and I can smell it all day, I'm quite sensitive to scents, and am not a fan of vanilla.  I won't purchase it again for this reason.",1
"If you want this enough, spend the extra $20 on Juicy Couture's actual website. The one I got was a fake. However, Amazon was helpful and refunded my money. Be aware that you cannot return fragrances because of the flammable liquids.",0
This stuff smells AWFUL!!  I tried using it a couple times even though it smelled bad because I was hoping it would at least work but I didn't notice any difference in my hair.,0
I don't usually write reviews but I purchased this pillow case a little over 6 months ago and I am just not impressed in the least. I was searching for a silk pillowcase that wouldn't cause wrinkles while you sleep or terrible bed head in the morning. I came across this pillow case and it seemed so interesting I wanted to try it out.  There has been no difference from my regular cotton pillowcases except maybe this one feels even a little rougher on my face.  Today I will be purchasing a silk pillowcase.,0
"it heats up quickly, gives me those big curls that I love. It's easy to handle and it has a long cord.",1
"Didn't notice any results from this product. I tried it on all types of acne, small blemishes to cystic, and I didn't notice any change in the size or anything. I'd recommend an astringent instead of this product. There's more variety for specific types of skin and acne.",0
I've been using this product once a day along with cardio and interval training 2x a week. Haven't noticed any toning of my body.,0
My favorite perfume. I recommend this product,1
"I bought the original eternity for men because I wanted a nice scent to wear at a wedding. It was ok but I found for me that it didn't last very long so decided to try Eternity Aqua. It smells great, last a decent amount of time and my lady friend loves the way it smells on me. Let's face it in the end that's all that matters.",1
"My hair is very frizzy and curly and this product  makes very little shine.  When I sprayed it on my friends nice straight hair it was very shiny!

If anyone knows of something that works on frizzy, curly hair let me know?",0
"It shore does help tame my beard and keeps most hairs in place.  I've noticed that it does it's job best if you apply it on a completely dry beard.  So not after a shower.  I noticed some complaining about the beard feeling a bit stiff... I don't know what they would expect if they want some control.  The feeling isn't bad and I deal with it as long as the beard maintains its hold.  During mid day, if I've been running around a lot and the beard looses its shape, all I do is run the comb and the shape it again without any additional application.  It's a bit flaky, but not noticeable (only when I run the comb through it hours later).  I don't know how I feel about the smell.  It's a nice hair conditioner type smell that you'd find at a hair saloon.  I don't hate it but can do without it.  I'm happy to buy a product that is not tested on animals, so that's a great plus.

Reason for 4 stars:  Looking at the ingredients, I'm not too happy with some of them.  It uses fragrance, which is no bueno for the hair if used regularly.  Overall, their ingredient list is safe (although not natural) and some are even beneficial.  I use this product once a week when I go out and have a long night ahead of me and want the confidence that my beard is looking good.  Otherwise, I stick to natural stuff for the majority of the week.",1
"I have read about Hot Tools for years, but never bought one because I mistakenly thought they were too pricey. This one curls beautifully.",1
"Works great, but leaves your hands a tad greasy afterwards",1
"100% fake. there's some kind of cheap conditioner in it or something, but it's not olaplex. it made my hair even more stiff and breakable.",0
"The cream itself is hydrating and feels great going on, but the scent is horrible!!! Smells like some cheap old lady cream! Yuck!",0
I bought OPI Red. The polish was old and thick. Disappointed. Old polish just doesn't go on well. It's thickness indicates the  age and or conditions it's kept. Opi Red is a gorgeous color red.,0
"I ordered this because it was supposed to soothe skin and relieve inflammation, and since I have rosacea I thought this would help. Instead I got to experience the fire of a thousand suns burning my face. The nice part was that afterwards, my face looked like I had been burnt by those thousand suns.

If you like the feeling of a chemical burn, this product is for you. Otherwise I might suggest a different product for anyone with even slightly sensitive skin.",0
Too greasy for me . Smells nice though. I wish I could use it.,0
"It smells like you are walking by an abercombie and fitch store in the early 2000s.... other than that, it works well. It conditions my hair better than most shampoo and conditioner combos.",1
"not verry good
thought my hair would grow it did not",0
Expecting this to last longer than other polish for the price point. Used it with their non-UV gel kit (base and top coat) and didn't seem to aid in longevity of polish. It does look fantastic and luscious for the first two days but after it seems to crack and chip.,0
"For a small object, I was charged $12.00 for shipping, which is way to expensive.  I will never buy these again.",0
This item doesn't wear well under makeup; it flakes.,0
"After six months, this is failing to keep the temperature hot.  I will be trying to warranty this product.  Will go back to what I used before that lasted me for 10 years..Don't waste your money.",0
I absolutely loved the sample of this perfume from a retailer. This bottle is a faint scent and doesn't last any time at all!  Very disappointed.,0
"The hand creams that I received seem to be old. Both tubes were dried out, very dense, less fragrant, and greasy as compared to a previous purchase of the same product (which I loved.)",0
"I have the red Babyliss Pro TT Tourmaline 3000.  This diffuser does not fit.  It goes over the nozzle and clings on fine, but the air comes out the bottom and makes ur hand real hot.  i thought it wasn't so bad at first, but it takes forEVER to dry ur hair that way, and then the leaking air gets really REALLY hot.",0
"This is not what I expected from this brand. Did not like this at all. Only used once, but that was enough. I felt like it left a residue on my face.",0
Not a fan. It works with the dryer I got but it doesn't cup the hair well. Also the blue inset piece is already loose after 6 weeks so I doubt it'll last much longer.,0
"I love Mary-Lou-manizer and was hoping the other two would be nice as well. Unfortunately, the other colors break me out. I'm sure they're fine on most skintypes. These are quite a bit smaller than the singles, if anyone was wondering.",1
This is a nice four pack shadow in a chick looking compact. It has a mirror to use when applying but lost a star because it does not offer an applicator nor a place to store one. The shimmering powder goes on nicely and last all day. Because there is no price listed at this time on Amazon I can not address if it is a good value or not.,1
"I've used this product for some time now .

I usually order  it from the Toppik site .

this was a much better price than the Toppik site and it is exactly the same product , quality , etc.

arrived very quickly ..... no issues",1
"First things first, I would not advise ANYBODY to use this shampoo DAILY. Everybody should make it a habit to skip a wash once every two days. It will help build up the natural oils in your scalp and let it reach the hair shaft. Not to mention, this shampoo tends to dry your hair much more than other shampoos.

The minty scent is also not MILD as advertised. It's rather strong and almost overwhelming, so much so that it has made me want to close my eyes on more than one occasion (as if I was peeling an onion).

The shampoo also doesn't produce much lather, so you will most likely end up finishing it much quicker. I did see some volume, but that took more than two weeks to show. Just remember that a Protein Shampoo will not promote hair growth. It will only help with repairing and mostly strengthening.",1
I know finding the right natural deodorant is hard but this made me smell awful. I'll continue my search.,0
"This product just wasn't for me.  I'm not sure what ingredient caused it, but I had an allergic reaction to the serum.  It was unusual because I had been using it for eight weeks, so I didn't believe it was the serum at first, but after removing all 'new' facial products and adding them back one at a time, it was the Prevage that caused my entire face to break out in a red itchy rash that lasted for three days.  Unfortunately I can no longer use thislots of money wastednow off to find something that works for me.",0
Not worth the price.  Too small.  Transportation cost you more than the item,0
I ordered short rollers thinking they were for SHORT hair. The smaller ones worked ok on my longest hair but the larger of the rollers were useless to me.  I had to give them to my granddaughter.  I like the concept and might consider buying a set for SHORT hair.,0
Doesn't keep make--up from transferring onto clothes. No reason that money should be wasted buying this rather than another brand.,0
I don't think I got an authentic one. The almost empty one is the real deal while the full one might be a fake. I'm not really sure. Maybe they got a new packaging but I'm pretty sure they didn't. I love this product but not fake ones,0
I love this color. Essie is always a hit or miss for me. This is definitely a hit! Plus i love the name!,1
"Arrived on time, a Sunday -wow!  Packaged well.  However...this item is baby sized. Upon closer inspection of my order it does say 2 ounces, but it looks like a sample. I purchased it as a stocking stuffer (it cost over $14) but I think it'll look too much like a free sample so it's a gift I'll have to explain. Hopefully it performs well and they'll get over its size.",1
"Received plain, dirty white container with a printed sticky label on it. Nothing like the picture was received.",0
Same great product I'm used to getting.,1
Went on streaky and the color on nails really isn't like the bottle I would not purchase this brand for nail polish again.  Very sorry and I like Crabtree and Evelyn products,0
Excellent product.  I was allergic to their sister product but this one seemed OK.,1
"A few years ago i started getting seasonal really bad chapped lips for some reason. Ordinary chapstick I found to be completely useless. I've tried lots different brands and while some taste nice and probably work well for the average person, I found that only a few actually work to rid my chapped lips.  This was one of my top choices because it actually worked and had a nice consistency.  But my one gripe, and it seems everyone else has this gripe too, why does it leave your lips white! Seriously it leaves your lips white. It makes it look like I tried to eat the chapstick or i'm really clumsy with sunscreen. Sure if you rub it in with your fingers it goes away but you don't always have a mirror around to make sure it's going on clear.  With that said it's still better than 95% of chapsticks out there. Oh it is a little pricey but you get what you pay for when it comes to chapstick. If you're a woman and wear lipstick/gloss the white shouldn't be as much a problem. If they could get rid of the white stuff i'd give this 5 stars all day",1
"Did not like it at all. Was suppose to get a gratuate tan, but instead I got Way to dark the first time",0
"bottle was not full and unfortunately it did not smell the same as in the store I first got to smell it.  Lesson learned, do not buy on internet.",0
First used this on a Holland America cruise and had to have it when I got home.,1
Rating explains,0
The bottle arrived with a broken cap and conditioner leaking.,0
Protects the hair!,1
The black coating on this curling iron chips off and ends up in your hair!,0
Unlike the epicurean lip balm in the small container this one is too much in liquid form and is not long lasting.  I will not buy this again.,0
"While I do not totally love the smell (smells mediciney to me), it does make my hair feel fuller and my thinning spots are not nearly as noticeable!  I don't notice a grand new growth of hair, I think it just plumps up the follicles and makes it less noticeable by far!
Some other reviews said the foam made their hair feel dirty or sticky.  I did not notice this. It's just like a mousse, I just put it on my roots and it totally helps achieve that fuller look too.",1
Broke halfway through doing my hair after 4 months. Won't heat up - it's useless.,0
"Not impressive, but I didn't expect it to be. I got what I paid for. Wouldn't buy again. Hope this helps",1
Finally...the perfect daily sunscreen,1
This does not smell the same.  The smell is acrid and very unpleasant.  I want a refund!,0
"I bought this sample product for the express use of determining if it will be worthwhile to purchase the full size. Since I get credit for what I paid towards the full size, I figure it is worthwhile to see if it will help my skin. I used a small amount last night on my excessively dry skin and I have not seen any flaking as yet. I am going to continue to use this sample to make sure before investing a large amount of money in the full size.",1
"works great, but the packaging caused me to only have a little less than half the bottle left to use. :(",0
"***Updated***
It smells great once your done showering, a very pleasantly unique smell but not overpowering.  My skin also feels very clean and refreshed.  The strong post-shower smell only last maybe a hour then it morphs into a subtle smell that I doubt others around you can detect the scent, unless your up close, because when I smell my arm up close, It smells great...
...and on that note, the last few ladies I had been with loved sniffing me and kept saying ""OMG, you really smell great.""

The bottle lasts between 30-60 days.  I use a wash cloth to get the most out of it.  I also compliment this with the Molton Brown Body Scrub bar, which I use every other day, and also the M.B. Antiperspirant.  So yeah, I smell good.",1
"This is my all time favorite cleanser. I was introduced to the avene products  by my dermatologist 8 years ago and this has been the only thing to help with acne, oily skin and rosacea that I suffered with. I have noticed a difference in my pores as well. I will forever be loyal to this product! Now that Amazon carries its so convenient and less expensive than buying at my derm!",1
I was very disappointed with this product.  LOccitane no longer makes lavender that smells like lavender.  Don't know why they decided to add different fragrances to their original wonderful lavender.  I will no longer buy this brand.  I will have to find another brand that smells like real lavender.,0
I was really looking forward to trying this product. Unfortunately the plug in on the unit will not align and it cannot be charged. We have tried fixing it several times over the past few weeks and I think that this unit may be defective. I would look forward to a contact from the manufacturer to return the product or be advised. In all fairness to the product I cannot give an accurate review.,0
Great product,1
Been using it for a few weeks and not really noticing a difference.,0
"I have weak, ridge-y nails that break vertically.  This product is not a cure-all, but it helps.  I have fewer down-to-the-quick breaks and fewer breaks overall.",1
Very good product!,1
"This product is terrible in terms of coverage and manufacturing of the tube/wand. The opening of the tube broke on the third use, so the whole wand pulls out without having the piece in place that wipes some of it off to evenly distribute the product on the brush. Before the wand broke, the mascara itself provided minimal lash coverage - you would need five minutes worth of constantly coating to get anything to even show up.",0
"I really really really like this product because it smells so good and I do like the foam and the feel! BUT! When the product arrived, I accidentally checked it against the light and noticed it was only 2/3 or less of the bottle. Thats very disappointing and shocking to me. I was ready to give it 5 stars but now I can only give two stars, one for the smell, one for the discount I got from Thanksgiving. It also makes my skin feel dry, maybe it is better for oily skin. My friend also told me this product is very easily to be used up. She felt that it pumped more than enough every time she used it. Now I think it might due to the bottle half full.",0
Too bad this color is discontinued. Lucky for me this vendor had it in stock! Great reddish brownish mauvish color!,1
My wife loves this little gadget,1
Nice !,1
"Gives me a perfect subtle color any time of year, whether my skin is fair or tanned.",1
Love this mascara!,1
Don't buy here! Nice product but advertised as being 5.4 ounces but it's not!  They send 4.5 ounces!  Be careful!,0
Not great for styling at all. Went ahead and bought a different straightener because this was not a smooth styling glide i was looking for.,0
Probably my favorite toothpaste on the market right now though sometimes I buy Portuguese close-up from big lots from time to time. A little goes a long way and the picture on the tube is very light-hearted and interesting to look at!,1
Works great,1
"I hesitate sometimes to write a negative review, but this product has a 4.5 star rating and my opinion might save people some money. And I get repeated messages from Amazon and the actual seller to offer up a good review.

Yes you can get a close and smooth shave with Proraso Shaving Cream, and if this was the year 1948 I would say it's a very good choice, but it is 2013. The product smells of petroleum, just like most shave creams did in the olden days. Modern shaving cream products are much better than this. They lubricate better, rinse off easier and they don't smell like a cross between the local Texaco and the chemical plant.

In addition, the most popular variety of Proraso is the Eucalyptus and Menthol. While the mild burn that these oils cause is perceived as a cooling sensation by our minds when used as a facial shave cream, these same ingredients, used in more sensitive places cause a definite burning sensation and turn the skin red and purple. Modern men shave more than their beards, and a dab of any menthol and eucalyptus product down there is no fun at all. Proraso is not alone in offering menthol and/or eucalyptus oils in their product range, but it has to be brought to the attention of people who choose not to keep the body hair they naturally get covered in.

The best two things about this product are the low plastic content of the packaging, and how long a tube lasts. But when it is an inferior product, maybe we wish it would not last so long.",0
Too expensive....ok product... AVOID.,0
"Tasty, smooth, lasting & just enough sparkle for grown- ups to enhance your lipstick and/ or lip liner with a sumptuous glow!",1
The best,1
A must have for the tough shave in your life,1
"WHAT IS A EXCELLENT PRODUCT RECOMMEND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS FULFILLED IF POSSIBLE AND WE REQUIRE IN THE FUTURE, buy it AGAIN willingly, TIMELY YOUR CARDS ENTTREGA SELLER",1
"Ok, for $130, I'm not so sure.  However, if I took the price out of it and just evaluated the product, it's very good!  I've been using it for about two weeks now and noticed less redness overall.  I tend to have a splotchy complexion.  I started slow as I know is advised with a retinol product and used it every 3rd night and applied only at night.  I had very little irritation other than some redness after applying (but good the next day) and a slightly ""sunburned"" feeling.  No peeling.  The next morning I was pretty oily as my skin has a tendency toward, but no breaking out.  I still feel like I need to apply my regular mineral powder makeup each morning as I still have some splotchiness in my complexion...however, I feel that overall it is better and it's only been 2 weeks.  I wish I had more time to use it before reviewing the product, but will try to come back to edit my review after it's been a couple of months.",1
"even with careful care, these break. I am on my second and won't be ordering a third. Spend your money on a different curler.",0
Love the product but it is a bit pricey.,1
Not sure this was a good authorized product; left my hair with sticky residue even after rinsing well.,0
May work well for someone else and as a side note I do have very dry skin/hair/nails...well this did my nails in - they peeled and cracked. The polish didn't stay on longer either. However the shipment was fast and product arrived in great shape. This just didn't work well for me,0
"This palette is absolutely perfect. I like very natural eye makeup - usually neutral mattes with some occasional color for fun. This palette is perfect for that look, and the darker shades work great wet as a liner.

I've been a stila eyeshadow fan for a while now but had never used their blushes until now. I was very pleasantly surprised - they are so pretty! They're buildable so you can have as light or heavy a look that fits your taste. I have tan skin with warm/neutral undertones, with dark hair and dark eyes. All of the blushes look very pretty against my skin and last all day.

The packaging is GORGEOUS and simply delightful to open every day. However, it's cardboard, so keep that in mind.

Also: you might find this cheaper on the stila website or ulta. Shop around. But you can't go wrong with stila eyeshadow.",1
"I love this product for my curly hair, but the two bottles from this order seemed much more watery and did not seem to be work as well to control my curls and frizz as it usually does.  I'd bet this was watered down.",0
"This was overpriced and underwhelming.  Small samples,  one use sample packs,  will not be ordering again.",0
"As a hairstylist, I've had & used this iron before & ordered a new one. Iron came in quickly but plates don't touch flat when closing without forcing & temp doesn't get hot enough.",0
My husband loves this product and has very sensitive skin. He uses it with his foil electric razor. I highly recommend this item!,1
"I brought this product and it stopped working within a week and I cannot get my money back. The light still come on, but it did not heat. Very disappointed...",0
"Prefer my curling iron - I have long, thick hair and I preferred the curl of my larger barrel curling iron over this tool - it was to much work/coordination and the curls were just ""okay"" - I returned it",0
Love this lip balm!!! It's the only one I use now!,1
"I love Vichy dermablend I have been using it for years , HOWEVER, I have a feeling this product is fake, I compared it to my other empty Vichy bottles and there are a lot of areas of the packaging that concern me such as the little square containing the color, it's different than the ones I have purchased at like CVS I will post pictures.",0
"Only four stars as it is not my number one favorite <G>...  It arrived as it should have a little late, but it made it.",1
Probably my favorite out of all of them. Such a good refreshing and little nutty,1
Love the way it feels on my skin! Great coverage!,1
Not enough coverage and seems greasy.,0
"I do feel it helps keep my face moisturized, but I definitely think it could do better with the ""mattifying"" portion for the price that you pay for such a small amount. I use it once a day, in the morning, and use a cheaper moisturizer at night to make it last longer.",1
I have very thin hair and this product makes my hair feel oily.,0
This was just a very expensive and greasy moisterizer. It did absolutely nothing for helping with my melasma which it was advised to help with. I could have just gone to the beauty counter and bought a less expensive and better moisterizer.,0
Have used this product before and I like the results.  Seems to help with some of the thinning on top and nice results on the hair itself.,1
"I have never used a product that defines curls like this.  If you are looking for something moisturizing, this is not it, but you can quickly remedy that by finishing with a layer of oil (I use jojoba or olive) after you spray this on.  I got so many compliments the first time I used this.  I can finally embrace my curls.  Make sure to saturate your hair with it.  I also scrunched my hair and let it air dry and then put some oil over it to keep the curls moist.  This is a keeper.",1
"packaging for the product by the manufacturer has some flaws in this version - it leaks, however, I think they have new packaging now. I thought I was getting the newer packaging but so far this one hasn't broken the seal and started leaking but the last one I bought did. The product itself I think works well, and if you don't travel with this in your bag it probably won't leak.",1
Does not smell right,0
"Does not do the job. I bought it as a moisturizer, something to put on after shaving that way it would serve as a moisturizer after I shaved, while serving as a sun blocker. It does not work, I have to apply it several times to moisturize. I don't know what it has but moisturizers are not a very strong ingredient. Personally, I would not recommend it.",0
"Curler is used 3 or 4 times a week.  Purchased as a replacement for a similar 1/2"" curler.  Works great and expect to use it for a long time.",1
Two of the handles spin and only 1 locks.  The barrel is too short.  I hate using it.  I'm giving it to my stylist because I threw away the box and am unable to return it.,0
Lengthens without clumping.,1

It was very hard to choose the correct color but if you know which color you need then this is one fantastic concealer. Love it. It takes a little patience to apply but your patience will be rewarded. It is by far the best concealer for the face that I have found.,1
"I have been using this for almost 10yrs (I'm 29) and its the absolute best makeup remover on the market. The others are too harsh or oily. Once you try this you'll never have to worry about removing your makeup again. The gel is delicate and removes ALL makeup like ""magic"".",1
My tanning mousse ran through the mitt and still made my hands orange. Disappointed,0
This hair dryer has a low setting that is not low - it is higher than the high on my prior hair dryer.  It is so forceful that it is difficult to style my hair.  The heat and forceful air make it very hard on my fine hair.  I am totally dissatisfied with this hairdryer.,0
"I have curly hair and I wash it every other day, I was looking for a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and this did the job.

I gave it 4 stars because I'm not crazy about the smell, although the conditioner has better smell than the shampoo.  Either way, it's worth buying because it does the job.  My hair no longer looks damaged and dried.  I'd recommend for sure!",1
"This product, according to the Pureology website, replaces Precious Oil Versatile Caring Oil. However this product is very watery. I'm wondering if this is fake or this is normal. Hard to believe a watery product can replace an oil product.",0
Love this product and have used it for years. I would highly recommend.,1
Left my hair stringy. No bounce.,0
"I have with color treated, straight hair past my shoulders.  I was looking for a shortcut to a long hard blow out with a round brush and my heavy dryer (also Babyliss, it's AMAZING).  This tool does a great job of straightening and smoothing!  By rotating it on the top of your hair to smooth, and then the bottom to straighten and curl under, it makes my straight hair almost too smooth!  There are several videos on Youtube you can watch to get some tips, but I start by rough drying to almost 90% dry.  That sounds like a lot, but if you are worried it'll get too dry while you are using this tool, just section and rough dry, then straighten with this, then rough dry the top or other sections and follow suit.  Since my hair is normal/fine I can do my hold head and bangs until it's just slightly damp and then use this tool in small sections to smooth and straighten more.  My only complaint is that I wish it came in a smaller size to help curl my hair more at the ends, but I understand why it doesn't - it would definitely get caught in you hair.  I have never had this snarl up or pull my hair out, it just gets the same amount a round brush would.  I highly recommend considering it's well priced and I love my other Babyliss hair dryer.  It's great to smooth the top and get a shiny, ""just blown out"" look.  This definitely saves me a little bit of time (you still have to section out or it will get tangled) and a TON of effort.  It's so much easier than using a round brush and dryer.",1
"totally detectable, if you want people to know you're trying to cover something up- put this stuff on..... won't buy again.",0
Perfect shampoo following a keratin hair treatment,1
"I love this shampoo!  I've been using this shampoo for last 5 years, and  I will continue to use it!  It's a great product!  Fast shipping!",1
"I bought this for a ""gift"" for a personal friend but too embarresed to send it to her because it looks like I went through a department store and picked up ""free"" samples from the counter or a hotel stay.  Do not buy this ...",0
"Proraso is a great brand and they make great shaving soaps. I don't much care for the aroma of the sensitive skin soap, though. It's not bad, but the other Proraso soaps smell better. Since I've kicked the habit of cartridge razors, my skin isn't so sensitive anymore. I'll use this one up and then go with the red or green tub soaps.",1
"I have very little good to say. It does not and will never treat ""hairloss"" so save your money. Its ridiculously expensive for what it is and very cheaply made too. If anything, I had to have my hair cut more because it grew faster.....but NO EXTRA HAIR!!!!! Dont be conned.

They told me at Lexington that if I stopped using it, my hair would revert to how it was before using the Lasercomb and could be much worse. So you ""can never stop once you start"". This is rubbish too. My hair is fine and i stopped using it over a year ago.

Its not a hairloss treatment and never will be. I'm sorry people but there is NO cure until gene therapy is more mainstream. SAVE YOU MONEY AND DEAL WITH THE TRUTH! At least for now once its gone.....its gone.",0
"I just bought this product, and the bottle was dried up it was in poor conditions",0
"Mediocre. I wish I'd spent more to get the one I really wanted.  This brush gets caught in my hair, even though I have a bob, and it does not work nearly as well as I hoped.  If the weather is at all humid it leaves my hair fuzzy-- and I have very straight, fine hair.",0
"I've only been able to use a trial size from a hotel. Using the conditioner and shampoo together is fabulous! I have kinky curly hair (4b), and it leaves them soft moisturizer and shiny! I didn't wanna spend $10 on a bottle. but I might have too!",1
"I am a person who wears very little makeup, so I was really looking forward to the talking tutorial that walks you through the steps of creating a Smokey Eye look, unfortuantely the talking portion on this paticular palette did not work. At least it has the illustrated instructions that you can fall back on.",1
I think the shampoo does the work well. I didn't feel that the conditioner was usefull after all. And it's a small bottle so quite expensive if you want treat your hair for a long period,0
the product was shaken up when it was delivered to my house :(,0
This product came fast and was exactly what I ordered!  Unlike some other times the product is not yellow and 1/2 filled.,1
"Unfortunately, this did not work for me. I will say it is very moisturizing and would be great for the winter; however, it actually made me oilier in my T-zone, and there is no mattifying consistency/texture whatsoever. It's just plain moisturizer.",0
Do not waste your money on these.. they did not do anything for me.,0
product arrived unsealed and not full.  too expensive not to arrive in brand new condition,0
"Purchased this hair gloss, it came unboxed and about 1/4of the way empty...previously used hair product was not in the description ...very unhappy with this purchase",0
Got taken. did not realize that I could get the same product in a larger size for less,0
I returned it because it seemed like just another thickening conditioner and I don't like the way thickening shampoos and conditioners make my hair feel. I'd rather use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner.,0
"Very nice perfume. Perfect size if you don't wear it all of the time. The smell is a bit ""young"" for me though.",1
"I love this concealer!! It is the best, I first found it about 8 years ago at sephora and then they stopped selling it, so I bought it at the balm.com website. This product lasts about 6 months if used every day. It is thicker than other brands. Comes with a smaller sponge inside. I love this company and always stock up! Recommend it to all my friends. Can be used at night. Try it!",1
"This cover creme is as described.  It's thick but not difficult to put on.  Can be applied with fingers or sponge or other.  Like it says, it will smear so finishing powder is required to set if worried about smearing.  If you have wrinkles, know that it takes some skill to apply; otherwise, you'll end up with unintended lines of accumulated creme where wrinkles occur, such as around the eyes.  A light application and finishing powder ought to prevent this.  With face cream, it was easy to take off, and my skin did not react at all to the product.",1
"This product is terrible. Once you follow its instruction to apply just two nights. You will have very obvious dark circle around your eyes. I guess this product may help increase the growth of your eyelashes, but it could also contain some kind of pigment, it will darken your eye circle areas too.

My photo definition is not good enough to show the dirk circle area that obvious after using this product. I swear don't  have dark circle at all before I use this product just for two nights.

Highly suggest not to use it!",0
Does NOT work on my fine hair. I threw the box away so I cant return it.,0
Not the best molding product...,0
Sadly I used this only a handful of times and then it died on me. I owned a hot tools iron for YEARS before this one before it tuckered out. Wish I could return or replace!!!,0
"South Korean beauty and skin care products are all the rage. But are they really worth the hype? This mud mask left me with mixed feelings. Using the patch technology so popular in administering medications, it features a two piece mask. The box contains four, each individually wrapped. I am not sure who they used as  model for these but one size most definitely does not fit all. If you have small eye, a long nose and a big mouth in an oblong face, well you are in business. Application is a bit tricky. The mud (actually volcanic ash) infused mesh fabric is covered on one side by white plastic and the other a clear plastic wrapper. Remove the white and place over the face. Then peel the clear side away, pressing into position. Once you separate the mesh for the backing, it goes pretty quickly. The mask has a light, pleasant lemony fragrance. Leave on at least ten minutes. I left it on for twenty so that it dried completely. Peeling it off was a snap. Then rinse face with warm water. There was not much residue and it rinsed off cleanly and easily. There was no tightness or dryness and I experienced no negative reaction from this product.

I must say that after a session my skin looked and felt terrific. Pores did seem minimized and my skin looked fresh, smooth and healthy. It felt
soft,moist and smooth. Frankly, I wish this stuff came in a jar. The mask itself was clunky and although I don't mind looking temporarily like one of those Gray aliens that abduct people for the sake of beauty, the mask need major alteration to fit  the contours of my face. I also wish they had an unscented version. That beings said, the ends justify the means and the results overcame my objections to the method. It is not perfect and you will most likely need to perform surgery on the mask and still some areas will remain untouched by the mud, but overall, it was effective.",1
The product bleeds which is not what I expected in light of the price.,0
nice color,1
Just stick with the Daiso.,0
Doesn't get rid of oil but oil sheen is definitely less than it was.,1
I love this fragrance and have been wearing it for a some years now.  Always get compliments on it when I wear it.,1
Has much as Mustela products cost I was expecting some type of results but unfortunately this did nothing to fade or prevent my stretch marks. Bio Oil is the best in this case. I wouldn't recommend this product,0
makes hair very oily and heavy,0
"The product is too large, it takes up a large portion of a roller board bag, the rollers get so hot that they burn your head, you must unplug before they get too hot.",0
"Honestly, my Pantene detangler works better. This stuff weighs down my fine hair and feels like I'm just adding extra conditioner.",0
not amazing. but it does smell like bananas,0
Excellent,1
Coworker's xmas gift.,1
this stuff is horrible,0
"In want to start by saying I love Elta MD products.  I have used the brand for years.  I've been unable to find the barrier renewal complex locally so my only choice was to purchase it online and you can't purchase it directly.

This product would have been great if it wasn't EXPIRED.  The smell was terrible.  I tried using it 3-4 times but the smell was so terrible I ended up tossing it.  Complete waste of money.  I wish I could describe just how awful the smell was.  I ended up using my husband's face lotion to get me by.

Again, Elta MD is a wonderful line but only if it's not expired.  So gross.",0
The only comparrison I have is EJ soap & cream from a can.  This is my favorite of what I'be used.  I use it daily & am pleased with it.,1
Lolita Lempicka has such a sensual scent that will take your breath away.  I bought this fragrance and Flowerbomb at the same time and I must say this scent has given Flowerbomb(which is much more expensive) quite a run for its money!! i would definitely recommend!!,1
Great product for my curly hair.,1
the coverage did not last only a couple of hours. was not what i expected.did not do what was advirtised,0
"great product, smells great!",1
"Im a loyal customer for this product. Been using it for years and never had anything to complain. Great product. However, this time the product I received was very diluted somehow and I have to use a lot just for daily wash. Very very disappointed",0
Best stuff out there!,1
"Works for me, but the lids is easy to be broken.",1
Great price,1
"I was sent the Nice palette but when you look on the picture it only shows the Naughty palette. I specifically wanted the Naughty palette because the box art is a lot nicer, if i would have known they were going to send a random palette that has nothing to do with the picture i would not have bought it in the first place. False advertising. I'm disappointed.",0
Excellent product Excellent Seller,1
"I first heard about grandelash through my amazing lash technician. I read through several reviews about how the ones that say ""eyelash formula"" are fake and lo and behold I received one of them. However I was rest assured because the seller confirmed that they are not fake, and that the company had changed the packaging, so I continued to use it.  I don't have sensitive skin, but i would feel burning every time I applied it. And it would severely darken my upper and lower eyelids so several people thought I was sick. I had a gut feeling that something was off, so I checked the bottom of the box and the QR code had been purposefully scratched up so I can't scan it. So shady, and so creeped out by not knowing what I've been applying to my eyelids! Will be returning, and crossing fingers that I will get a real one the 2nd time around.",0
"I just started using it last week for under my eyes and I'm really pleased so far.  I have tried a huge range of concealers.  From drugstore level up to high-end ones like Cle de peau (I think $65 for concealer).  I've also done the Laura Mercier secret camoflaugue, bobbi brown, Mally, Kevin Aucoin, etc.  I was about to splurge for Le Mer but a friend turned me on to this one.  So far, so good.  It is definitely true that you need just a small amount, but the tube is kind of tiny.  I applied tiny dots of it under my eye and then pressed it and blended lightly with fingertips.  The product stays put and definitely give great coverage.  It's different from other concealers which eventually creep into fine lines and I'd look in the mirror and have to dab it back in with my fingertips.  This barely does that at all.  It lays flat and smooth without looking dry and matte.  One downside is figuring out the color.  I am not sure which stores carry it.  The Sephoras in NYC didn't seem to.  I'd definitely recommend and have already told some girlfriends.",1
"Had it on clean, shaved skin and it failed within an hour. Tried four times. Sadly, there is no option to return this and I'm angry SO much money on a product that would be guaranteed if I purchased it through the company.",0
wanted to buy a larger size but they don't sell it anymore? ive looked everywhere for a more-than-12-oz bottle with no luck. this shampoo reminds me of college so its a nostalgic thing for me but it also smells like bananas so that's cool.,1
"This is some of the nicest quality eye shadow that I've ever used. Unfortunately, it's not my favorite, mainly because the dark brown is a bit cooler color than I prefer, and the lighter, golden color would be better (for me) without the glitter/shimmer, although it isn't as pronounced once on as others that I've used.  The colors go on smoothly, blend well together with a brush, and last all day.

The compact set is good sized and the case includes a generous mirror.  It arrived with the shadows intact and they don't fall apart easily with use.  The colors are heavily pigmented so it doesn't take much to achieve the effect that you want.  I feel that these are high quality shadows and really worth the cost, if you find the right color.

I will continue to use these and experiment with them and others that I have.  I would recommend this brand from my experience due to the high quality and quantity that you receive.",1
I use Neocutis serum and love it but this Broad-Spectrum doesn't go on smooth.  I like EltaMD UV Daily better.,0
Great stuff!,1
"A friend of mine highly recommended this product for its use as a sunscreen for the face and scalp, but the product fell flat for me. It feels really greasy on my face, and I'm not sure whether it's noncomedogenic or not, but I can practically feel my pores being clogged every time I use it. I wouldn't recommend using it in the part of your hair, either, as it builds up gunk in the hair making it stiff and dirty. To top it off, I'm also not a fan of the sunscreen-y mint smell.",0
"This is the only thing that worked on my son's acne after YEARS of trying EVERYTHING you can name- including treatment from two dermatologists! Very hard for a teenager!
 It is VERY strong and can be drying, so he uses a hydrating moisturizer to balance his skin. His skin looks AMAZING! So pleased with this product!",1
"This company is horrible! I looked on there website to find a salon. The woman at the salon listed had never used the oil before, although someone else had applied it to her hair. She had to look up the instructions, used too high a heat and burned my hair! I could hear the sizzle. When I called Bio-Ionic, at agaveoil.com the rep said they had no control over who was listed as Salons on their website agaveoil.com.  Sleazy!",0
Broke after a few months!  Never had this problem before with a high-end dryer.  Wondering if seller sold a refurbished.,0
Not so pleased.,0
Saw some of the dark spots left from bad blemishes begin to lighten up within the first week. Haven't had any new breakouts and it smells SO good. Will definitely be using again!,1
Doesnt work,0
"I was just about to buy this and two other of the AHAVA products when I read one customer's concerns in the most Critical Review. I looked up Dimethicone online and sure enough, she had it right! This product sounded so perfect to me, but I do not want to age my skin more (in the long run) by using this silicone-based polymer, Dimethicone. It provides a smooth application, but imagine having a thin, rubber-like cover over your face all day and night! It's too bad, because most of the other ingredients sound natural, but because they put Dimethicone in it, I will not be buying it, as I have now done research showing that because it coats the skin, it interfers with the skin's natural processes, e.g.. sloughing off dead skin cells, and can actually end in drying your skin more, eventually causing MORE fine lines and wrinkles in the long run.  No Thanks!!  AHAVA,  figure out a way to leave out Dimethicone or other chemical products and I will be happy to try your product!!",0
"It goes on nice and thin and doesn't make my skin as oily as other sunscreens. I have a real problem with acne and oily skin. This sunscreen worked better than anything else I've tried, but wasn't a miracle either. When I used it, I was on Retin-A and my skin was super sensitive to the sun. This kept my skin nice and protected. I would recommend, but it may still make you break out  if you have acne prone skin.",1
I love this soap!,1
PICTURE IS NOT WHAT YOU GET!!!  The picture says it's the Extra Body Sculpting foam.  I got the Medium style hold.,0
"Great blush - The balm really puts out great products. Totally worth allt he hype. Soft pink color, not over done.",1
EXCELLENT,1
"Worst concealer I have ever tried. Cakey. Accentuates instead of concealing. Will be returning, a first for me.",0
I really like this product but the shampoo smells better. They could have perfume this a little bit more. It does moisturize my hair very well,1
"My skin is hideously sensitive, and it has bad reactions to a vast majority of products. However, my cheeks and chin tend to be really dry so I can't go without some kind of moisturizer. After using this nightly for a few weeks now, it doesn't seem to break me out, which is a huge plus. It does impart some softness and moisture to the skin, but not to a great degree: it gets rid of that tight feeling that comes with dry skin, but it doesn't eradicate all flakiness and dry patches. It does not have an overwhelming fragrance like so many products do (what very little bit of scent there is, is more along the lines of a general, unscented lotion).

All in all, I really like this. While I wish it moisturized just a bit more than it does, the fact that it doesn't cause reactions in sensitive skin is a very big bonus, so I'd definitely recommend this.",1
It was not powdery. It was all clumped together. Hard to get out of bottle.,0
Very hard. Overly dry,0
My boyfriend and my son both use these products and they are terrific.  They smell incredibly good too.  Ladies-  do yourselves a favor and purchase the product line for your man.,1
I am a hairstylist in a dominican beauty salon. We deal with mainly extremely curly coarse hair and I'm normally forced to use my blow dryer on high but with this blow dryer I'm able to use a medium setting and get the hair with lots of body and beautifully straight without even having to smooth out roots or frizz with my flat iron. And with fine hair whether straight or wavy Iam able to smooth it and successfully form curls and flips.  Best blow dryer I've had so far,1
I have baby fine hair and it did seem to add a little extra volume.,1
"I wish it had more power, takes to long to dry your hair. It should also spin on its own.",0
"I would give 1 star if it was possible. Zero result after 12 weeks of using this product. My hair is falling off as before, no improvement, no new hair at all. Very disappointed. Total waist of money.",0
"Great professional iron, gets very hot and makes beautiful curls! Definitely recommend purchasing one!!",1
"The box, like for many other people, came broken with product spilling out. The product, however, is wonderful.",1
Perfect for traveling!!!,1
"When it arrived, the top of the bottle was broken off and about a quarter was inside the plastic bag the bottle came in. Kinda bummed about it.",0
Pump was broken and unusable. Very annoying. Lotion is nice but would have purchased if pump functioned.,0
"AMAZING
FASTER SHIPPING
I'm so much Happy!!!
The cream is the best cream.
Obagi for ever",1
"What you see is not what you get - the item received is ""fabgirl"" slim - appears to be a fake/knockoff. Buyer beware.",0
"I like wearing neutral color on my nails and I usually love Essie.  I went with this color to get some subtle glitter.  I was disappointed with the product.  It goes on with lots of streaks.  It needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish.  I stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it doesn't last as long.  The good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color doesn't show.  I wore it for almost a week, so that's good.  I doubt that I would have been able to do it with 3 coats, but I will experiment.  It is a good color for the office, but I still wish that it was less ""watery"".",0
The best straightening iron of all time,1
At first the cool mist worked great but within a month the mister stop working. I contacted company and they were suppose to follow up and still no resolution,0
"Although I have tried worse products, this product was not for me. It dried my hair out, it was frizzy, and felt like product was still in my hair. I tried it for about two weeks. Also, one of the bottle was broken and leaked out in transit.",0
"This is a nice color, but it is sooo watery. Seriously it takes like 5 coats for full coverage, & it gets all over your cuticles despite being careful. Zoya fail!",0
"I bought it from Costco. It was a good price. But I don't know what it suppose to do for your skin.
My skin feel the same after use and it itches during usage. Anyone else?",0
I used to love love this and have been buying it for years but suddenly it does not last neeeearly as long as it used to. I have experienced a super short life on the last 3 i've purchased unfortunately,0
I like how this product is supposed to help your nails stay healthy.  It seems to be of good quality in its thickness etc.  I hate how using nail polish can stain your nails so I was happy to see that this product is supposed to help prevent that.,1
once I used it with the hot hair dryer every thing burned out. please don't spend your money on this .,0
I'm not sure this is the real deal. I've never had OPI polish that wore off so quickly. The color is pretty but I won't buy it again.,0
These are great brushes for the Clarisonic. Not too harsh on my skin. I will be buying these again.,1
DISAPPOINTED  I don't know what say about quality but I've bought mine because I've loved another like it that I still have. I Am very disappointed because the black isn't the same! It has some golden drawing very ugly and not the same as picture!,0
I don't like that the temperature cannot be controlled and it generally gets too hot and could possibly scortch hair,0
This shampoo is fantastic!  I use it everyday.  It's the only one I use!,1
exactly as expected,1
This conditioner smells horrible. I have loved every Biolage product I've ever used but this verges on disgusting.,0
Does not seem to stay in place. I bought the brown and it seems faint and not worth the bother. Was hoping to fine a better product for my eyebrows than pencils. This was not it.,0
"The product appears to be very streamline and CORDLESS but that is completely inaccurate.  Although, NOT AMAZONS fault!!!  I placed an order and received a corded product which is not what I was looking for.  Amazon graciously re-ordered it for me and low and behold the same corded product arrived.

I then went onto the Silk';n web site and saw the corded and portable / rechargeable photo's as well.  I waited over the weekend until the manufactures office was open and they no longer make the cordless / rechargeable model.  So,  needless to say I am ordering another make and model.  Who wants to be lassoed to an electrical outlet!!!",0
Only worked a few times,0
It is awful I do not know if this was old or if this is the way this product is. It just clumps on terrible!! I love Jane ire dale make all I use but this mascara does not lengthen makes you look awful!!!!,0
This product would get five stars if they gave you more and if it weren't so expensive. It is quite satisfactory in every other way. Someone needs to come out with a similar product to drive the price down.,1
Needs strong acetone to fully remove. Almost clear,1
Love this product.,1
Not is expected,0
"Works very well and smells great.  Kind of thick, like warm honey and leaves your hair smelling like you just left the barber.  It has great hold, but you will definitely be able to tell there is something in your hair.  If you don't distribute it well enough your hair will be a little crunchy.  You can re-wet your hair throughout the day to restyle as needed.

A little too heavy of a product for my tastes, but I will use the bottle up.  If that's what you prefer I would certainly recommend this product.  Smells much better than a lot of other similar products (Vitals, Lucky Tiger).",1
"This color is a little lighter than I expected.  I probably wouldn't have bought it had I known, but I do still like it",1
"I have been natural for almost 10 years my hair is almost to my waistline.  My beautician does a two strand twist on my hair i let it dry and take it apart i used this edge control today and my scalp is itching so bad i may be allergic to some of the ingredients.  I like the consistency of it, but unfortunately i will not be able to use it.",0
"I was so excited to order this curling iron when my old one broke.  I had heard amazing things about the Hot Tools curling iron and they are all true.  It curls better and faster than any other curling iron I've used.  If you've been considering buying this curling iron, just do it!",1
You only gave me one bottle when I paid for three!,0
"I would have given the Klorane Silver Highlights shampoo 5 star rating, except it is a bit pricey. But, a little goes a long way. An i it really does bring silver highlights to my mostly white hair. My nickname was ""Cottontop"" when I was very young and maybe I'll be called that again! "")",1
Excellent,1
I was looking for something to help my brittle nails grow a little thicker and so far I feel like it really is helping!. Would recommend to friends and family.,1
Not what I expected. Powder shades were too opaque.,0
I don't care for this product. Not your momma's hair products are better when it comes to this volumizing powder.,0
Good heat. Flexible heat and force settings. Has been used  several times.,1
This candle smells incredible and it arrived early! It was a great experience and I plan on ordering more very soon. The candle burns evenly and lasts a very long time.,1
"Although the bottle appears to be different from the picture, but product is freshly made in 2013 and I am happy!",1
The product burns and is not very good.  I should have done a better job on research before I purchased this item.,0
Didn't work for me.,0
Should last me all year!,1
Stopped working almost immediately. Apparently a shirt in the cord. Actually was never able to use.,0
"I have been looking for a good roller set since my Hot Tools set keeps conking out on me. This arrived with clips and those metal holders and works very well. I have long, straight fine hair and the curl holds up to my expectations. I would buy this.",1
"I've tried different types, brands and colors of bronzers.  This one by Bliss (Bliss Me Carmel) is a great shade of Carmel with a touch of rose color.  It is great for bronzing or contouring.  The downside of this bronzer is it is way to glittery for me.  I am in my mid 50s and do not like anything (actually have never like anything) with glitter in it.  Shimmer I can handle, not glitter.  This has small pieces of glitter in it which really shows up on your skin.  I can see this being more suited for a younger person or someone who actually likes glitter in their cosmetics.  Other than that it is a silky bronzer that lasts all day.  Update:  I let my coworker who is in her late 20s try this bronzer and she absolutely LOVES it.  She likes it as a bronzer and eyeshadow making this a multi use product.",1
"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1
I have used Epicuren products for many years but never the Evening Emulsion.  I have been using it for a few weeks now and love the product and sometimes use it in the morning too to switch it up a bit.  It is a nice thick cream.,1
Works perfectly,1
Recieved bottle with NO safety seal - afraid to use it! Don't know if it's been tampered with or even replaced with something totally different than I ordered. I DO NOT WANT TO USE IT!!!,0
The Parfum arrived in the factory sealed box. When opened it smelled as wonderful as expected. Would buy from again.,1
Wonderful detangler for my luscious locks!,1
I honestly don't think it does anything. I feel I wasted my money.,0
Good,1
"I had huge hope in this product so spent that much money, but it didn't work at all. Makes my face itchy whole day every time I put on , and yes new acne on where it itches most.",0
"Love this stuff more every day. Not harsh like other exfoliators and makes me feel clean and my skin very soft. Definitely recommend this and the facial exfoliator. Both great products for a great price. However, be clear on reasonable expectations.  Specifically, this scrub is not physically going to eliminate sagging skin.  That expectation is simply unreasonable.",1
Very happy with this polish and it was shipped properly and promptly as well as being a fantastic price.  Thank you.,1
"Recommended by my dermatologist, but purchased thru Amazon to save money. This clearly is not the same product as sold by doctor's offices.  For a few dollars saved, I now am struggling to restore my skin back to where it was before using this product.  After reading one star reviews just now, I see that others have had the same issue and attributed problems to the product sold thru Amazon as not the real Obagi product.  Returning it today and going back to dermatologist's office to buy THE REAL THING! Buyer beware! Apparently, this happens with many products sold thru Amazon as I have read similar reviews on other skin care products with similar comments.",0
"maybe i am using it incorrectly, but it didn't seem any different from other brushes, perhaps even a bit difficult to use at first.",0
A well-received gift.,1
"I learned about Toppik from Oprah's magazine a few years ago and think it's a great product. I have fine, curly hair that is thinning and have used rogaine, nioxin and derma-match in the past. So far, the combination of rogaine with Toppik has given me the best results.  I have spent many years being afraid to have my picture taken because if I see that any of my scalp is visible in it I get very upset and self-conscious. Toppik resolved the ""scalp shine"" issue you sometimes get in the summer or in strong light- I no longer have to worry about what my hair looks like in pictures!

My only reservation about this product is that it can get a greenish tint to it if it gets damp so steer clear of the rain.",1
"Lovely all in one facial cleanser.  This product effectively removes all of my makeup, including non-waterproof eye makeup.  (I haven't tried it with any waterproof makeup.)  It leaves my face feeling clean and supple.  I like having a one-step product to save time.  This is my go-to cleanser at the end of the day.",1
"Disappointed,I thought from the many positive reviews this would be a clean light fragrance but it isnt. It has staying power which is a plus.",0
Didn't  get the results i wanted,0
it break. i can't use it,0
Love it and was cheaper than salon.,1
"This feels very dry going on, almost like a powder. I prefer more moisture.",0
Smells not bad for the money,1
Did not like the smell.,0
Does not provide enough holding ability.,0
"The product does not seem to be authentic Paul Mitchell sculpting lotion. It has the consistency of water, an unusual smell and it does not help with styling.",0
This product is great !  I buy it all the time .  There is nothing better on the market.  Unfortunately this one did not have a top so I could not compare and will not be able to use it .,0
"Bought from Oribe site.  Like everyone else, I love the smell of their hair products and was excited to see the eau de Parfum.
The smell is very close, BUT the disappointing issue is that the scent does not last.  Whether you spray on skin or hair you will find that the scent does not last even for an hour.  I have several high end pafumes. I buy Parfum because the smell, to me, seems richer, deeper and more luxurious than eau de toilette.  I wouldn't even call this product eau de toilette, it's that weak.",0
Love the product and will do business with them again.  This product definitely works but takes 3-4 months for results.,1
When using this product the bristles fall out and get all over your face. I would not buy this product again.,0
It would be foolish to give this blowdryer a 5 star review cause I am sure that there are nicer ones out there... but I guarantee they cost twice as much. I did a lot of research and for the price this is a great deal. I have recommended it to other people cause I very satisfied with the performance. Very solid deal,1
Dries out my skin,0
I liked it alot but really If It's A 10 with Moroccan Oil works better. However Colorproof anti frizz leave in conditioner and the colorproof Crazy Extreme Shine are my stables now would use nothing else.,1
Great product!,1
It was perfect and MUCH appreciated. Am unable to purchase this within 100 miles of my new home so being able to do so through Amazon is a blessing. Love this shampoo and am happy to have the ease this type of purchase!,1
"I received this item in a subscription box a couple months ago, but I wanted to wait to run out of my current eye cream before I started using it. So far, Im not disappointed by the quality of the cream! It feels great, almost chill, even just at room temperature. I just wish it was in a little jar that I could dab my finger into.",1
What I needed,1
Not impressed with his product !! It's really thick and makes a mess !! Will not buy again,0
Very nice gentle cleanser,1
Love this Product!,1
"I thought this was a moisturizer, but it is definitely a sunscreen. I would never wear it on my face, it's far too thick and it makes me break out.",0
Uff!  Its a stinker.  It smells like a certain golden antibacterial soap.,0
"So I first has this product 2 years ago and LOVED it. Then a month ago my husband accidentally stepped on it and broke it. Since I loved the product I didn't hesitate to order a new one, knowing the $100 price.  However what I received in the mail is NOT the same product. it feels cheaply made, more like plastic. the clamps don't even close together all the way. (the product I had before came to a complete close). and the dial to adjust the setting of temperature wasn't able to move. its as if they sent me a cheap knock off of the straighter I once loved. I informed amazon and they said they were going through another seller for this product. I returned mine immediately. Now I have to try and find where else to purchase this. I'm just glad I know what the product really is, so I didn't settle with the piece of crap they sent me. SUCH a let down.",0
I do not know if really works because I have been using it only for 10 days.  But once I applied my skin feels very smooth,1
"Unfortunately after a month it did nothing to help my daughters cystic acne. It's worse. Now trying other treatment, also don't work!",0
"This absolutely the best self tanner I have ever purchased. It is easy to apply and the color is extremely natural. It has a very slight odor, but fades after a few minutes so doesnt really bother me. It does dry quickly and produces a dark even tan. You definitely have to use a tanning glove to apply.",1
"Has a good smell, not a strong hold what so ever, other reviews said it was hard to spread in their hair not the case at all, very thin, did not like it compared to other clay products like Baxter of California or even Layrite. I would not consider this a clay at all, more like a matte pomade",0
Doesn't smell very good especially for the price.,0
"I read about this product online before purchasing.  It smells good, and thought it would be good for my ""mature"" skin.  I have oily, thick skin (told by my dermatologist recently) and was told that this stuff is like glue on skin.

I guess if you have really dry skin, it might be a good option, but not for someone like me.  I am a 54 yr old white female.
Tried to return it, but the expiration date had run out on Amazon.  I've never had to return anything from Amazon before.
It's $100 no matter where you purchase it, not really worth the money.",0
All u need is a small dab mixed with water. Holds my hair all day. Great stuff,1
"My skin just drinks this up.  It's one of those products that I can see an immediate difference after only one use. After using this product, my skin looks dewy and radiant.",1
Good product.,1
I love the idea of this product but the shadows are thin and pigment doesn't show up very well. You would probably have to put layers of eye primer on to make them work correctly. Maybe it would be a good present for a young kid who wants play make up.,0
Excellent quality and is easy to apply coverage. Color is actually more normal than prior bottles.,1
"I'll purchase from Neiman's next time.  It doesn't work! No paperwork was included so to return or exchange, not easy.",0
Great product but it came without a lid and like it had been opened.,0
"For the price, it is a total waste of money! I bought it for a trip, but there was such a little amount for the price! Won't do that again!",0
"My wife bought this, I've used few times and it works good, looks like professional product. Settings adjust the strength well.",1
I bought the barbers classic and the clean cut gels to see which was better and clearly it is the clean cut. the barbers classic is too goopy and messy for me. save your money and don't buy the barbers classic. this clean cut is a much better product and holds my hair much better. only down side it is very expensive for the amount you are buying.,1
very harsh on sensitive skin.,0
This cream is awful.  It goes on like a mask.  It goes on white a and flakes off after a while.,0
This is a great product.  works great to cover scalp.  Would recommend this to anyone who is feeling upset about hair loss.,1
"I normally buy this at my salon but I was in a time crunch and reluctantly decided to replace it via Amazon Prime. I love Oribe products and the real version of this conditioner is wonderful. However, what I received in the mail was not the same Oribe that I buy from my salon. At first, it smelled pretty close but after I rinsed the conditioner out of my hair, it smelled like gasoline/metallic. Yuck! It also does not condition- at all!  Don't buy it here. Go to a salon.",0
It's a great product. It's helping me with dark spots.,1
"Great sunscreen, love the spray bottle",1
I used this religiously for a year and a lot of the hair seemed to be gone. I stopped for a few months and now ALL of my hair is back.  I am convinced I have MORE hair now.  I can't believe I wasted all that time and money!,0
I never write reviews... But this stuff is incredible. I've never had anything that cleans my brushes so well! I will buy nothing but this from now on.,1
Gives your hair texture but it is an awful texture.  It feels like dry syrup sprinkled with a very fine talc.  Horrible.,0
It works but it takes too much time to apply ... going back to spray,0
"This lotion feels great, is non-greasy and has a beautiful scent without being cloying. It's one of my favorite hand creams! I keep the small size in my purse.",1
It arrived dry. The color looks like the color I was looking for. The seller was very nice and sorry it was dry. Might try to order again since grey mascara is impossible to find,0
Very Good,1
"I like fragrance coffrets, because it gives you an opportunity to try several fragrances in a small size, and thus know which one you like best and wish to purchase in a large size.  (They also make a great gift, because, hopefully, the recipient will like at least one!)
This Juicy Couture Coffret comes with four fragrances:  the original Juicy Couture, Couture La La, Viva La Juicy, and Viva La Juicy La Fleur.
Here are my thoughts on each one:
Viva La Juicy La Fleur was my favorite, a soft delicate floral.  However, the fragrance did not last long on me at all.
Viva La Juicy - loved it, sweet and vanilla smelling.  May purchase in the regular size.
Couture La La - fresh and citrus-y smelling.  OK, but not a fragrance I personally would choose.
Juicy Couture - my least favorite.  This smelled really medicinal on me when I first sprayed it on.  Almost like Noxzema face cream (if anyone remembers that).  Maybe the one I received had gone bad, or maybe it is just my chemistry.  After a while it calmed down, but I still didn't care for it.

Also, if you do purchase this, here is how to open the bottles.  I only mention this because I couldn't figure it out at first and tried to unscrew the top.  You pull the top straight off - glass top and metal band come off together.  These are not sprays; you dab them on. The presentation box is absolutely exquisite.  It is gold, the top has a magnetized closure, and there is a pretty pink bow on the front of the box.  The inside is also very attractive.  I am keeping it to use for some of my jewelry.",1
"Haven't used it long enough to see results however, it has a certain smell that makes it hard to keep using it. I don't recommend it.",0
"Several things I didn't enjoy, very fragrant.  The lotion was very fragrant and also had an odd taste, yes taste, I could taste it even though it was only on my face.  And I do have a husband who also kisses me, he said it was perfumey and kind of a turn off.  The lotion also dried my skin out.  At first I thought, this lotion is new, I'll just give it time. I had already been using the serum for awhile, so I was surprised at how dry my skin got. By day five my skin was red and itchy and very visibly dry.  I gave it a few days off, and tried again, the same thing happened.  This is not a lotion for me.  I have mildly sensitive skin, oily in the T-zone, and dry everywhere else, my skin is neither mature or very young, it's in it's 30s.  I used as directed, with other Vichy products I had already been using.  This lotion was not for me.  Perhaps others will have more luck.",0
Absolutely worst leave in conditioner I've ever used. Does not help with tangles at all. I was really disappointed.,0
"Honestly, this powder doesn't do anything. Don't waste your money on this. Just buy the Biore nose strips and you're good.",0
"While I like the AG Fast Food leave-in conditioner, this shampoo is terrible. Every time I use it, it instantly tangles my hair. All the way to the roots! I recently went from my dark brown (almost black) hair to blonde highlights and I do NOT want to damage my hair trying to untangle it! It didn't feel like it moisturized my hair at all. It's back to old faithful--Matrix Biolage.",0
"This would be a great iron if the clamp that clutches your hair was tighter and also seem
To heat up only to 210 , not enough for coarse hair,",0
"What happened to the curling rods that worked with ease and gave you great ringlet curls.  There was a time that professionals used curling irons had swivel handles that allowed the device to continue to twirl while the hair is securely clamped to rod, all the way to the end of the rod -- without having to use your fingers or a glove that semi-protects your hands from the intense heat.  This is my second try with a curling rod and it is still just as awkward now as the times past when I've tried to use this.

I'm sure this product is wonderful for many, but in my opinion, this isn't nearly as good as some of the more traditional curling irons.

M. Bittner",0
"The firm hold is not for me. I have very fine hair and when I used it, felt like my hair was all being pulled off my head, it is just too sticky. I however do love the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Styling Gel. I have used it for many years, and it works really great on my hair.",0
"the smell of this product is just awful. Not at all like the other Ouidad products. The product itself may actually work on hair that needs  it, but first you have to get pass the smell. thanks for asking though.",0
"I love Jane Iredale pressed mineral foundation.  They have a good variety of colors and have a shade I wear in Fall/Winter and into early Spring and I wear a darker shade in the Summer.  I have very sensitive skin the breaks out easily and I love that this foundation never breaks me out.  Also, you can apply lightly using a brush or can get better coverage applying with the sponge.",1
"I'm a bit disappointed. I paid a lot of money for this and saw great reviews, but it doesn't help my thin hair get texture. My hair will look slightly more voluminous for a few minutes and then fall flat :( I definitely wouldn't use it as a dry shampoo eitherif anything it makes my hair greasier.",0
Love this color!,1
great for short hair. gives nice volume and hold. Used to use a GHD product but that was since discontinued. This is the best that I have found as a replacement. Would recommend his.,1
I just received my order and have used it once but it rinsed well and smells lemony. I would suggest to lather the shampoo in hair and then let it sit a minute or two before rinsing. This should help your scalp if you have any issues because it has Tea Tree in it. The conditioner is light and easy to rinse. I know its Paul Mitchell but the bottles are a little small for the price.,1
terrible product - gave no hold at all.  Strong smell that didn't go away either. For the price really expected much more from the product.,0
"It definitely is not greasy and seems to disappear into the skin soon after application.  I presume it works as advertised blocking the harmful rays of the,sun; i hope,so as I am very sun-sensituve!.  I wish it had a slight fragrance (outdoors aroma perhaps) because I don't care for the faint odor of the zinc oxide, but that really isn't too bad and you get used to it quickly.  I think it's a winner!",1
"I really enjoy using mama mio products, so far they have worked wonders for me. The smell is fantastic as well",1
"This violet shampoo works pretty well.  I have used it several times, and have been mostly pleased.

The biggest reason I gave this shampoo 4 stars rather than 5 is because I found that I had to leave it on my hair longer than I am used to for the violet shampoos.  The ones I have used in the past have worked within 4 minutes, and I found that this one took about twice as long for the same effect.

On the other hand, the effect was good -- it did take away the brassiness nicely, so in that I am pleased.  Would I buy it again?  Maybe not, because I don't like to dawdle in the shower for 10 minutes waiting for the shampoo to take effect.  But if I had the time for long leisurely baths -- this would work fine.  (Maybe I should make the time for leisurely baths...but that's a whole other story, LOL.)",1
Nice neutral pallet.,1
"This product did absolutely nothing for me. In the vast sea of products that make promises they don't keep I would say this is one of the most expensive per ounce.  I would place it right up there with a bottle of snakeoil without the historical value. It was costly and got lots of stars and in my naivete I equated that with being effective.  All heads aren't alike though, maybe your experience will vary.",0
"Doesn't give you very much color and it sprays very unevenly, I suggest mystic tan home spray..way better for the money.",0
"I wish I'd bought this curling iron years ago. I have another ""fancy"" curling iron that cost over $100 and it just sits in the closet because doesn't work nearly as well as this one does.",1
"I think this is a great product and the smell is amazing, but when I got the bottle I ordered from amazon it had a crack in it and it all leaked out. I would suggest buying it in store...",0
"It worked well at first, but got dirty quickly and is hard to clean, Mine dried out after only a couple of uses.",0
"Purchased as a Christmas gift, so I can't comment on the performance of the product yet, but I was happy to be able to purchase this through Amazon.  It arrived quickly and in great condition.",1
"nice but color is very faint, perfect if you're going for a natural look",1
"I have chemically relaxed hair and I did not like this for my hair. My hair is shoulder length and not fine but not thick either. This was too oily for my hair and weighed my hair down and made it look stiff. With African American hair I have never used a heat protectant or anything at all before straightening but that is also why my hair is severley heat damaged and breaking off not including the damage the relaxer alone does. With this it seems you have to be VERY careful I mean drop for drop careful. Maybe I never figured out exactly how much to use. Even a dime size amount was too much and after blow drying my hair was stiff and oily, not flowing and shiny. Just not for my hair type or texture. Still on the journey to find a heat protectant that is light enough for flowing hair but not oily and greasy so the search continues.........",0
"The shampoo I ordered along with this conditioner is just fine but this conditioner had a strong, stale, unpleasant order. I purchase this product because of its aroma.",0
Perfect brush.  It really makes a difference.  My hair feels softer and more manageable,1
Love it!! I have acne prone skin and have had no problems. My skin is usually pretty oily and this doesn't enchanted the oiliness.,1
I've been a long time fan of Stila brand eye shadows since they are reasonably priced and stay on through out the work day.  Colors in this small palette are accurate.,1
Great stuff!!  It really works. You have to be patient and use consistently. It is worth the time & trouble.,1
My hair is much more manageable with great volume and a lot of shine!,1
like it,1
"Product is a light shade & very thick, as other reviewers have mentioned. I have to spot it on & then go over it with my make-up. It seems to work on keeping larger blemishes at bay once they have formed (I don't use it as prevention), but it doesn't work overnight. The smell doesn't bother me as I have used other products with sulfur and knew to expect it. It's not a terrible smell, and I'm glad they don't add fragrances to try and cover it up. It's just a little medicinal, if you will. Anyway, so far, so good, but nothing to rave about.",1
Gorgeous colour - LOVE it!!,1
The nail polish came discolored and immediately bubbled on my nails. It is having the same effects as my nail polishes that are older have.,0
Not super dark black but really easy to use.,1
"Of the 20~ preshaves I've tried so far, this one stands up to some of the best. The dispenser adds to the ease of use. As far as preshaves, I like something that stays wet but sticks... and this is it. There are a lot of too runny and too thick options out there and this one seems to be right in the sweet spot.",1
"Very pleased, thank you!",1
expensive for the quality,0
"the quality is so low and you cant return it
That's ridiculous
The smell is so so
So its not a great deal
but still doubt if it is a fake one or not",0
Its too obvious when worn,0
"The Rituals The Ritual of Ayurveda Body Mist is a 1.6 ounce body mist that comes in a glass spray bottle.  It sprays a fine mist, & it is highly fragrant so a little goes a long way.  The first time I tried it I sprayed it on my hand, because I have sensitivities to flowery scents & I wasn't sure how the cedar wood would be?  First spray will make you smile if you love orange. It has a sweet, orange smell that smells wonderful! It's fruity, & smells great. I didn't smell anything ""woodsy"" like you would expect a cedar wood to smell like.  I was surprised I liked this as much as I did.  It's listed as a Hair & Body Mist, & while I've never tried a mist for your hair (besides the smell of hair spray, gels, & products specifically made for hair styling), I think this is a nice body mist.

I would recommend this for those who enjoy the smell of sweet orange.

Remember- a little goes a long way, & the scent stays for awhile, so you only need a little at a time. The bottle will last awhile.

4/5 stars.

If it were strictly Sweet orange, without the cedarwood included, it would be a solid 5 stars. ;)",1
I like that this flat iron lets you select the heat setting.  I usually heat mine to 295 degrees and it seems to reach the temp in less than 60 seconds.  Easy to grip and use.  I've had my babyliss pro for 2 months now and it seems to be a durable and well made product.  No complaints here.,1
"Unfortunately this product came to me completely broken and I had to return :( I love lorac shadows because they are super soft, buttery and pigmented but I think in this case the shadows are too delicate for shipping.",0
Works great and I wake up with super smooth soft skin!,1
I've ordered this pencil twice and will continue to order as needed.  It doesn't cause irritation and goes on smoothly.,1
"I have ordered many times from Amazon, and this is the first time I was not happy.  When we received the product and took the top off, the pump part had been opened, and most of the makeup was inside the lid, losing more than 1/2 of the product.  We love the product, but the shipping/handling was very bad, we were very unhappy.",0
"I have had this for about a month along with the s1. I liked this and thought it did a great job but I ended up keeping the S1 since I thought it did a slightly better job and was a little easier to use. But this was still good..
(...)",1
"Though I am sure that this oil will do great things for your hair, what is not mentioned is how HIGHLY scented this product is. Within a half hour of using a very small amount, I had such a headache from the scent, that I had to wash it out. I wish they could make this product without the artificial fragrance. Ick!",0
Doesn't really plump,0
"I don't believe this toothpaste is better than other commercial toothpaste product. It cost quite a bit more as well.

I tried it because of the hype I was hearing. Even with the ""accelerator"", I haven't noticed any difference.

The green apple flavor is just plain nasty in my opinion.",0
Great scent.,1
"Excellent , great smell , sets up beard for a close clean shave . eShave produces the best I have ever experienced.",1
I have used this make-up for years and love how it goes on.  Looks very natural,1
Makes my beard nice and soft. Smells nice.,1
"Received today, I don't think this the real product since it doesn't even have a tint to it. Plus, it's watery.

Returning to get me money back, which is annoying because of the hassle.

So tired of getting of this happening.",0
Doesn't streak and provides great coverage. Doesn't have a weird smell. I wear almost daily.,1
"It's really watery, and there isn't much color. I've had this same problem with another opi that I got on amazon and I'm wondering if their quality isn't as good as in store.",0
"This is the best flat iron, just got rid of all the others.  It did develop a crack on the arm and would not close flat. Called BaByliss and they replaced it for $5 shipping.",1
"Purchased this product through Kohls. Nothing swimmable about it! Fades and smudges throughout the day so that by the end of my day, the product washes off with my facial cleanser. There are better products for the price.",0
Initially I thought this was my holy grail because I have hyper pigmentation on my cheeks from medication. It goes on great and provides that full coverage but just after only 2 hours it was so oily on my skin even after setting it and my hyper pigmentation showed right through it. I don't recommend this product. Now at is that lady they show with severe burns uses this stuff and it lasts all day!!,1
Brought it for my wedding but It burned my eyes every time I applied ..so it was waste for me.....but it has a very good presision pointer and was a really good jet black color,0
Using this product after applying make up for fresh glow look. Love it! Tried other products but didn't find anything better so far.,1
"the first time I used this product, my hair was great, smooth and controlled. But after the second time, my hair started to feel dry and frizzy. Be aware that this conditioner contains some kinds of silicone, and maybe thats why it was not good for my hair.",0
"I ordered the Kids Don't Cry Shampoo, but received something totally different instead The Paul Mitchell Clarifying Shampoo Two. It only just arrived and I have not yet started the return procedures, but I am not a happy customer.......",0
"I really wish I hadn't dished out so much money on this device.  I clearly had a moment where I wasn't thinking straight.

To start, this little machine is hard and awkward to maneuver. You need so much oil to keep it rolling along smoothly.  The lower suction settings feel as if they are doing nothing, the higher ones actually left bruises on my hips and thighs.

However, I persevered, and used it as directed.  Well, my cellulite starting looking WORSE.  Still, I kept at it, thinking perhaps this was all part of the process.

Frustrated with the fact that my cellulite was even more noticeable, I  started reading up on cellulite, and discovered that devices like these can actually make the problem worse.  The skin in the areas where you have cellulite is often already very fragile and thin- and suction can further break down the collagen and connective fibers (according to what I read).

I wouldn't recommend this machine and wish I could send it back- it's essentially a $140 pos that is now retired to my bathroom cabinet after a very brief life.",0
It doesn't really give you curls its way way too big.... Not good for the price at all be careful.,0
"I have to go through the hassle of returning this product now. I cannot comment on how effective the product is because I was literally unable to use it. As soon as I picked up the container, I knew something was wrong because it was super light and I could feel something rolling around in the tube. I discovered that is was completely dried up, just a small lump of hardened product, despite being sealed and being fresh according to the expiration date. I'm extremely annoyed and will just get a refund because I don't want to bother with a new tube in case I get another dried up mess.",0
"Everyone is right, the product was half filled. Only got three uses before product finished, invest in the gel cleanser of facial scrub instead. I use the cleanser with my clarisonic and facial scrub, you will still get the same exfoliating purposes.

I almost wanted to return the tube but I needed to try it as well. Will not be purchasing again except I'm getting my money's worth. Don't do it!",0
"This is the worst hair product I've ever tried. I bought it after seeing it on a ""Amazon Must Haves List."" The reviews were all good so I went ahead and bought it. The smell is terrible and honestly I can't believe this is the same product everyone raves about.",0
One of the best styling products I have ever used.,1
"I purchased this product because the gradual tanning lotions I purchased at the drug store caused my legs to break out after shaving after a few days of use of the products.  Unfortunately this product did the same thing.  It also streaked even though I was very careful in exfoliating.  I did not think the smell was that bad, though.  I will probably go back to Fake Bake after trying this product.",0
My hairstylist turned me on to this product and I absolutely love it. It smells amazing and my hair is shinier and healthier than ever. I would definitely recommend this product line.,1
it is very easy to use.  It doesn't pull on my hair.  Heats up immediately.  Everything I was looking for.,1
"Great dryer for a great price. Loved the fast shipment and the extended warranty. Have one for myself, purchased this for my daughter.",1
nice and very helpful product!,1
"I knew it would not be successful when reading the first ingredient was water.  It did not work for my dry, frizzy hair.",0
Love the product at first but then after using it 10 times it the mitt pulled away from the plastic liner....totally useless,0
"This tastes great, but I don't understand --it has no fluoride! It's totally useless as a toothpaste.",0
"Such a lovely color. Bright and vibrant - a real classic and a must have. The formula is great, goes on smoothly and dries well. My new summer favorite.",1
"this is fake product, it only last 4-5 hours, do not buy it
they are not allow to return either",0
Worst product ever. I bought it after reading multiple great reviews on Amazon and YouTube. Tried it on for over night on couple of my pimples but the chemicals had a bad reaction on my face and caused rashes all over my face. My skin was dry and at certain areas peeling off. I had to lay off of all products for weeks till my face healed. I would not recommend this product.,0
"This product is so easy to use, and very convenient for on the go. It deep cleanses and is not harsh on my skin which is very sensitive. Even after using makeup wipes and cleansing my face regularly, and then using this, it would take off any traces of makeup I missed, or couldn't take off. It is also very exciting to know they have different cleansing you could use with this product, and it was worth every penny to buy it. Love the charging system it came with, very elementary and simple to use.",1
"Amazing, melts into the skin. Feels light and non greasy. Love knowing I'm protected every day and wears well under my makeup!",1
"Why others rave about this product is a mystery to me. It is a small, thin towel and it acts exactly like any other towel. Not worth the money!",0
Wondrful,1
"I was hoping for a lotion to fight the very dry weather this winter, but this is not it.  It seems to lack the strong moisturizing that I'd hoped for, and I'm not found of the smell either.  Not a good product for a woman.",0
"I lost much of my brows to chemo and I thought I'd finally found something to get me through until they start growing back.

I was so pleased with how easily this went on and how natural it looked and it seemed to have lots of staying power.  I am not sure I'd say all day but much better than other things I have tried.

It is Day #2, and I am already have to shake the product into the brush.  I can't believe they would package something like this but looking at other reviews it appears it is the case.

If you are willing to buy a new tube every 5 days or so, you should give it a try!

UPDATE:  I just noticed actual product packaging say 0.02 oz.  I wish I had known that when I ordered it!",0
I though twice about spending this much money on a blow dryer but I am very glad I did! Love all the settings.  The cord is extra long.  It is not super loud.  Only thing negative is the weight of the dryer. I would highly recommend this dryer.,1
Good soap.  Skin feels refreshed after using.  It lather's easy also.,1
"I tried 2 others micellar water, from Vichy and Avene. This one considering size and price is much better. As far as result, I like this one and the one and also the one from Avene.",1
"Its not meant to be true to give full coverage, its just another ordinary foundation. I didn't see any huge changes. Doesnt worth the price.",0
"Worked very well for me.  It will leave a smudge, if touched, on fingers.  But that is to be expected.  Happy, for a short fix, which is what I wanted.",1
Reteturned...,0
I like its smell. But the effect of repairing seems not that effective.,1
"I'm not ordinarily a fan of dark polishes, but Chimney Sweep is a lovely color.  In some lights it has a green hue, in others it looks somewhat blue.  I love Butter London!!",1
great holding hairspray,1
This a excelent product.  This dryer accondition the hair and it is soft.  The only defect it that is not multivolt,1
"Not great, it does whine.",0
I cancelled my payment and it went through regardless! I'm really over Amazon and I will not be keeping my prime membership. The smooth liquid camp foundation was horrible so I definitely wanted no part in this.,0
"I lOVE this eye shadow! I love brown, nuetral colors and this makes brown eyes POP!  Also, the price was great... thanks Amazon! I can't wait to try the other colors. However, this container will last me a long time. There appears to be alot of eye shadow in this little round thing! I would recommend this eye shadow for all eye colors! Mine are brown, and as I said, this stuff makes them POP! :)",1
"Amazon was fantastic about my returning this product!!! However, it has a burning smell for a few seconds every time I turned it on and then had a high pitch squeal.  When I did return it, Amazon made the process easy and refunded my money quickly!",0
"I'm a sucker for things that change color so this was exciting for me. The packaging is stypid cute and it's shape is convenient for sticking in my bag. It isn't really gloss so much as a tinted lip balm that stains, which I liked.

My only gripe is that it doesn't keep my lips moisturized for very long, I have to reapply like crazy. I also have really dry lips that get chapped easily so if your lips aren't you may have more luck with it.",1
"Heats up fast and curls hair nicely. Wish it came it a wider width. Can't complain, it works great! Cools down fast, too!",1
"Best dry shampoo I've come across! I have dark brown hair and this gets the oily look gone. It doesn't have much of a scent so I use it with another product that has a perfume to it. A bottle lasted me almost a year and I use it about 3 times a week, so it's a great investment!",1
This is a good product....I saw results.  I have no complaints about this product or the company.  I would order this product again.,1
"SUCKS!  Both the product and container, as many have indicated.  Was a loyal fan of the red-tube stuff, now unavailable.  Bought this as a substitute, and not only does it leave my hair frizzy and dry, the tub it comes in is almost impossible to open, especially in the shower with wet hands.  Broke a fingernail.  Found some leftover Davines red-tube stuff (called something like ""relaxing defining fluid) in my travel kit and tried it yesterday -- Yup, it is very different and WORKS!  Please bring back the old one.",0
"I really like the way this foundation blends to match my skin tone. It's the first I've ever had that doesn't show a line between my face and neck color. It feels light but has good coverage.

The only thing that I've learned is that it makes the bristles fall out of two makeup brushes I've used to apply the foundation. Much better to use a sponge instead.",1
It exceeded my expectations and will be buying more.,1
"This fiber works well but the truth is this keratin fiber is extremely expensive per gram in comparison to fiber you can get on Ebay or here on Amazon from other vendors!....when you get down to it and strip the names off of these labels, you really only have two major options for realistic and natural looking hair fiber.  Gossypium Herbaceum Plant fiber (Caboki uses this) and Keratin Animal fiber (Toppik uses this)  They both are effective at providing natural looking hair coverage and most brands use one or the other of these 2 solutions....so it really only comes down to the cost to help you in your selection once you decide on which type of solution will work best for you.
So to keep things in perspective, Toppik is one of the MOST expensive solutions when you can get a product of equal caliber for alot, alot less per gram.  For example, you can purchase 75grams of another brands Plant fiber for the same price of 12grams of the Toppik and get the same results.

Trust me on this please as I have a bald spot in my crown the size of a monk and I've tested about 8 different companies and found very little difference in about 6 of the 8 products I've tried.

Among some of the ones tested:

Toppik
Caboki
Samson Hair FIber
Follic Tech
X Fusion
Finally Hair
Hair Squared
Westwood Hair

There may be a few more...but for the most part they are all very similar in performance and I wouldnt be surprised if they almost all came from 1 or 2 main factories.  Dont be fooled by the marketing.....get the stuff that is the cheapest and just refill the shaker bottles and you'll be looking sharp in no time",0
Bought this because my other straightener was giving me split ends from rep easily trying to straighten and this straightener literally works in a single pass. It also creates nice curls too! Love it!,1
I thought this was primer for makeup. Dummy me.,0
Wasn't very confortable,0
"a bit expensive as there is nothing special about it, i just like the dispenser a lot.  i'm sure i could have gotten one at sallys but once this one runs out, i can just reuse the bottle :D",1
Have been using as directed and am pleased as I ordered again.,1
"I love the product but when I received this shipment one of the 12 small sealed containers had been opened and was empty!!
Shame on you!
My e mail is carolcurtistaylor@gmail.com......not carol.taylor4@comcast.net!!!!",0
I like the color but started chipping off in less than 24 hours.,0
works as expected.,1
"CND Vinylux does not last for 7 days without chipping.  I applied the CND Scrubfresh on my nails and then applied two coats of the weekly nail polish, and then 1 coat of the weekly top coat.  The first time I had major chipping on the third day.  The second time I had major chipping in less than 24 hours.  I am giving this nail polish 2 stars only because it dries very quickly, therefore  I can paint my nails midweek after work and not wake up with sheet prints on my nails the next morning.  However, in regards to the claim that there will be no chips up to 7 days, that is just not true.",0
expensive but haven't found better product.,1
Overpriced and brands such as Urban Decay and Too Faced have better quality makeup.  I would not recommend this palette to anyone.,0
I absolutely adore Hot Tools. I have been an avid user of Hot Tools for 15 years and I am always satisfied with their products. I have thick wavy hair so I need hair tools that produce enough heat to style my hair. I have tried other brands which try to copy Hot Tools but they don't stack up. Most of my irons last a few years and I beat them up. I use my curling irons every day,1
Conditions my hair without weighing it down or making it too greasy. I don't feel that its very good with detangling though. I have to comb my hair in the shower while the conditioner is still in my hair to get any tangles out. Ive used this for several months and have been pretty happy with it. I will buy it again.,1
"It's not the worse thing I put in my mouth, but close.",0
"This is long lasting, very light and not greasy, and I know it does a good job! It's the only kind I trust to do a great job and protect me.",1
"Stumbled across this brand while researching for SPF that won't cause acne or have a heinous smell. This meets all my expectations. Light, dissolves quickly, dries clear, can wear under makeup without greasy appearance, and is long lasting throughout the day. It doesn't clump or chunk up or leave a chalky-look if you emerge in water. If you get it on your eyelashes by mistake, it will sting a little, but that is to be expected. Washes off easily. Love this and will continue to purchase, forever!",1
My hair is very dry from over processing. I have died my natural blond hair black or over 3 years. Because I was uneducated on how to make my color more shiny and dark I continued to put black dye over my hair repeatedly. My hair was breaking very badly and falling out in the shower. I have used many products and most of them were just a bandaid. This product actually helps rebuild the hair. Very natural. I have switched all of my hair products to Davines and my hair is night and day difference.,1
Sent back. The powder showed every wrinkle.,0
"Don't get me wrong, the soap is awesome. Smells great, feels great, rinses clean. What I have a problem with is the seller. The product was on stock when I processed it on December 1st, it's now the 20th and I still don't have it. It's estimated to arrive by January 16th. It's a bar of soap that weighs 5-6 ounces, and shipping was a cost on top of the product.",0
Good stuff,1
Not at all what I was expecting. Unable to use!,0
I love it and the smell too,1
I love you corrector! Cant live without you.,1
"Easy to apply and stays on very good. It does smells like cough syrup though, but the color is very pretty and vibrant at first application. Worth the buy.",1
Not the color it said it was and filled with a weird transparent goey liquid over the concealer inside( clear liquid isn't primer more like the makeup got old),0
I love Korres body butter! It's light jasmine scent is perfect on my skin. The fact is is not made with petrochemicals is why I originally purchased it. Delightful skin cream.,1
"To me, the fragrance is similiar to the discontinued Nomad line. It has kind of a powderfeel and soft fragrance. Will buy regular sizes in future.",1
I bought this curling iron for my girlfriend. It took her a few hours to get the hang of it.,1
This is a great color.  Sheer with a pearly sheen just perfect for my fingers. I love this color.,1
"Thank you,
Kurt",1
"Released nearly 30 years ago and still selling strong CK's 'Obsession' for men is a classic fragrance with multiple layers of scent elements blended together to provide a concoction that is at once mysterious, melancholic and deeply intimate.

The balance of elements is near perfect. The upfront scents of sandalwood and smoke hit you first but the citrus and floral topnotes impeccably reveals its presence with perfect timing. Do note that this is a strong fragrance. A half spritz is really all i need to last through the course of a day. The 1 ounce bottle will last a lot longer than you think and the smaller sizing makes for much easier transport on your trips and other such excursions of pleasure.",1
i don't feel any difference in fact make my hair oily - fake false advertisement don't waste money because it is expensive,0
Smells amazing but dried the heck out of my hair. NO. BIG NO. Haven't noticed any shine either.,0
The best cleanser ever ! It's concentrated so it lasts a very long time as you only have to use very little. The anti aging effects are great. I love the entire product line.,1
Love the color...but dries dull so you need topcoat. Great color on any skintone. 2 coats is all it takes,1
Great,1
In July the side and the back of my hair feel out with big patches in my head.  My daughter did research and suggested that I invested in this line.  I am 54 years old going to change of life and of course some stress.  I took her advice and purchase all the items that I think would help my hair.  I wish I had picture of my hair when it fell out.  However it as been several months since I have been using this line.  My hair is about 6 inches long and the patches are gone.  Phyto products really rock!!  They are prices but I think I am worth it.  I prefer to buy the product than by clothes.  Ladies you know how we feel about our hair.,1
the push down spray button keeps jamming and I don't get a steady mist.  Smells good but definitely wouldn't buy again - not worth the money,0
none,1
"I cannot for the life of me understand why this cologne gets rated so highly. I think the fragrance smells incredibly cheap - meanwhile a full sized bottle goes for over $100. HOW? It does last a decent amount of time, however... it just smells so cheap and synthetic. Not one of those ""natural"" scents by any means. I love orange scents but this is more like you squeezed orange juice into your eye and then vomited on a bowl of moldy water. And unlike other reviewers, I don't find that the scent changes or matures. It stays pretty much the same to me. And it's no good.",0
"This product left my hair VERY dry. Even my hair dresser noticed the difference, she said stop using this product. I did not get any volume from this stuff, got better results from head and shoulders. Sorry Oribe",0
Like like ,1
purchased after reading many positive reviews but I am disappointed: too strong & too floral for me,0
Did not like this at all. I'm very good at sulking my hair but the clamp is much to small and the buttons are located in a terrible spot where the button to curl to the right or left gets touched by accident which is very dangerous,0
"I have not had the irritation that I used to get using those canned gels since I got this shaving cream. It gives a good feeling of ""cool"" after a second or third pass for shaving.",1
Nope! We returned this product because after it came I realized it had additives I didn't want my hubby putting on his head. Read the label.,0
"Definitely don't like it for the price. Remington makes the same type of clear shave gel for $4 bucks, why is this so expensive? Not worth the $ at all!",0
"We purchased this as we loved the smell of it at a spa that we went to.  I like the concept however after about 3 weeks, it is only about half full.  I think for the price, it should last longer or they should have a discounted refill option.  Can't see how this would become an affordable option to have all the time.",0
it's a little more expensive than other shampoos.,1
"I've been using this perfume for 15 years. It's my favorite along with Hermes earth and another from Dior. This one however, is unbeatable in the price to quality ratio. Shipping was smooth as well.",1
Been using it dauly for 2 months...Doesn't seem to work for me very well.,0
"After a few weeks of use, I don't see a different in my under-eye area. I've used other eye products but thought to give it a try as this one got great reviews. I'll be going back to my other eye cream product.",0
"I have been using 2nd bottle now for almost two months. I haven't seen any good result yet.  I just ordered 3rd bottle and will be patient to try one more.  Will update the rating if it turns out to be good.

Update:  I am using 3rd bottles. I haven't seen any result yet but my scalp develops itching and irritation so I stopped using it.  I was using many hair products.  They did not work for me but none gave me this problem.
Reduced from 3 stars to 1 star",0
totally works,1
Did not use any after reading reviews about product being green and leaving skin green after application.,0
Easy to apply and doesn't smudge under eye as the day goes on - love that part!! I only wish it added more length/volume to the lash. I would still buy this again!!,1
"The product itself is ok. I just feel it doesn't look great on everyone, including myself. I have green eyes, dark hair and olive skin. This color makes me look washed out. I also don't like the consistency of the lipstick, it dries my lips too much and must be reapplied every couple of hours.",0
Cologne seems like it is watered down. I have had this same cologne before and this is not the same. I knew price was too good to be true.,0
"I emailed the company who makes the T3 hairdryer and asked which diffuser fits it.  NO answer!  I read all of the reviews for this one and got the impression that it would fit all of their hairdryers, so I ordered it.  it did not fit, so I had to send it back.  Very disappointed.  Amazon is the BEST.  They refunded my money even though the box was ripped.",0
"this curler barely works, not worth it at all",0
I have used way much better product leave in conditioner. Would not purchase again,0
love it,1
Gift for my grandson.  He loved it.,1
"This is a beautifully soft, pigment rich eyeshadow that can be applied wet or dry.  Unfortunately though,  the eyeshadow pan was shattered in transit.",0
"I ordered the Alloy color, a medium grey. The first application on one eyelid was great but despite vigorous shaking I was unable to get another good line of color on the remaining upper and lower lids. I sent it back but not before I tried standing it up vertically overnight. Still a bust.",0
"Always use this in the summer. Excellent product. Great price,great seller.",1
I give it only one star..delivery was very fast! But the picture made it seem like the barrel was thick as soon as It arrived I was disappointed it was very small and I have long thick hair..this is a curling iron for women with short hair!,0
"I have been using curling irons for several decades and  thought I'd give the Hot Tools brand a try as an upgrade to the cheaper brands.  I have never had one last as short a time as this one. In less than 5 months it went from working great one day to nothing the next.  And no, it wasn't the outlet because I plugged in my backup iron immediately following and it heated just fine.  Hot Tools seems to be better at curling than the cheap brands but how is it worth any price if it doesn't even last a year.",0
"i love Bioelements and every product I use just reinforces my love for it!  great cleanser, especially when used with the toner.",1
"I've used this iron for months now. It heats up fine and it's hot (temperature control works great but the control is too loose and allows for inadvertently changing the temperature setting while curling hair), the chord is tangle-free, it holds my hair perfectly tight and the on/off button is not inadvertently changed while using the iron. REASON FOR TWO STAR RATING: My curl does NOT stay after about 2 hours or less. My other curling iron of the same diameter does effect longer lasting curls all day.",0
"The worst!! I usually use strips and this was my first time using wax without strips. It hurt so bad, I couldn't finish. Instead of coming off in one big chunk, it peeled off in small pieces which hurt horribly.",0
Not sure how this even supposed to work.  No effect whatsoever.  Maybe it's just me.,0
Great product.  I see results with daily use.  My skin appears younger looking and more supple.,1
"I previously have been using the Paul Mitchell Reformer strong hold/matte finish (red label) and decided that I liked that product so much I would try out another one, so I purchased this one. It is almost the same feel wise (in your hands) and hold wise (for your hair) but the product doesn't smell good at all. It has a very industrial smell, like glue or something of that nature. So I was not a fan, I guess I should have stuck with a good thing in the first place.",0
This is the best product out there for healthy looking hair. Can't go wrong. Recommend it to everyone!,1
Not good for fine blonde hair.,0
"I have to say that some of these comments don't seem genuine... they seem a little too commercial.  In my experience, no KP product ever works completely, some are just slightly better than others.

I can't give a thorough assessment yet, but will when I've used the product for some time.",1
"my favorite. after hugs i always hear ""you smell like cookies"". i think that's a good thing :)",1
"We love this toothpaste! It really whitens teeth! We wish it was more available, but it's great that Amazon carries it!",1
This smells absolutely nothing like the sample I got from sephora. It smells like play dough. Awful. Will never purchase perfume from this seller again.,0
My husbands favorite shaving cream. Love that it comes unscented.,1
"LOVE! So easy to apply, specially with the applicator mitt",1
"I rarely use wax, but when I do, I use this wax. My hair dresser turned me onto it. Unlike the crap from the drugstore, this washes out easily and doesn't leave nasty build-up. It also gives my hair some volume. I use such tiny amounts that I can't imagine when I'll run out, but when I do, I plan to buy the same one.

Also, it doesn't stink gross.",1
Wasn't as powerful as my regular blow dryer but wow it made my hair so nice I didn't even need to use a straight iron afterwards. It gets quite hot not sure if that's the trick but it definitely shortens the time it takes to get ready,1
"Only able to get 10 face washings before the battery dies. It lasted one week MAX. I had the original Clarisonic and it would last 2 weeks b4 a charge was needed. The original Clarisonic was WAY better, worked perfectly for 2+ yrs. The Clarisonic Mia2 is not nearly as good as the original!! So sad.",0
"I bought this product because it was the highest rated and reviewed hair volumizing product on Amazon.  I have used it five times and every time I end up with greasy, limp, sticky hair, so I went back to my other product.  This is just sitting in my cabinet now.",0
"First of all, it was not waterproof, second of all the color was not black, it left more of like a grayish color on my skin, & third the part of the pencil that's suppose to bring up more product didn't work, so I was stuck with the small amount of product at the top. Needless to say I was not pleased with this product.",0
"I've been using a lot of different make up lately, but I really like the coverage that this gives me. The color is perfect for my skin tone, and it goes on very nice. I use a large brush to apply it, and it stays on pretty long. I always need to cover up a beauty mark that I have on the side of my face, and this does the job very well.",1
Not a fan. It works with the dryer I got but it doesn't cup the hair well. Also the blue inset piece is already loose after 6 weeks so I doubt it'll last much longer.,0
Bought this flat iron august 30th 2017 as a replacement for my last one. Great iron. But like my old one you plug it in and it turns on and it doesnt heat up anymore. Unless you want to buy a new one every six months I suggest you don't buy this..!!,0
"I don't know that it actually ""cools"" me down, but it is very light and does rub in very quickly and I certainly don't feel ""hotter"" with it on like I do with some other waterproof sunscreens.  I also prefer SPF 30 or so rather than the super zinc-ey SPFs of 50 or higher.  I'd rather reapply than feel like my skin can't breathe, this lotion works the way I want it to.",1
always great,1
"This aftershave has a weak, almost nonexistent, mildly chemical smell. No lime scent at all. Total waste of money. You may as well splash water on your face. It's a lot cheaper and you'll avoid all the chemicals.",0
"I am disapointed in this hair dryer.  it is very heavy, I originally ordered another one but two times my order was canceled (even though they kept posting the hair dryer) I kept it because I was without a hair dryer for so long that I couldn't wait to send it back and get another",0
Its useful.,1
My wife loves this stuff. It keeps her hands soft and mosturized. I'll be purchasing more for each bathroom in the house.,1
"Do NOT but this product!  I spent ALOT of money and I only got less than 2 weeks use out of it!  I went sparsely when pumping and using on my face!  This is not worth it and I will tell everyone I know NOT to use this product, for $154 and only 2 weeks before I run out of product, are you seriously?",0
"Not a good primer, was very disappointed. It really doesn't seem to do much of anything. It is hard to get on even and it does sometimes crease. The color is nice though.",0
BUENO,1
"Have been using this product for a little over 2 weeks and I'm stopping using it. It had made my eyes red and bloodshot and when I put it on, then close my eyes at night, sometimes I feel sharp pops of burning sensation, probably when more leaks into my eye. When I ordered it, the tube says just eyelash serum, not eyelash and eyebrow and another review said that just the eyelash stuff seemed like a rip off product. Maybe it is. I also don't think I've noticed much growth but I was going to try to stick it out longer to see, but it's obviously not good for my eyes.",0
Not the same as the original European one.,0
Horrible it is not even a natural color,0
works well,1
"as other customers have also noted PUMP BREAKS IMMEDIATELY and instructions on ""priming the pump"" by pushing down on button on bottom of bottle DOES NOTHING. This is NOT a problem that is solved. REFUND will solve this problem!",0
"While this product comes out tinted, applying to the face blends in well and you don't notice the tint.  My skin doesn't normally react well to products with sunscreen - and I know the importance of applying them.  This product is amazing - and I don't have any adverse reactions of breaking out or sensitivity.  I did dock it one star for the price.  It's outrageous - and I that price, I'm not sure I can afford to keep this a staple in my beauty care routine",1
"This palette is amazing. It's the first Lorac eye shadow palette I have ever purchased but it won't be the last. Like all the other reviews say the eye shadows are buttery, extremely pigmented, and very easy to use and blend. I am in love and wish I would have bought a second as a back up! As for the shipping mine came in a cardboard box with bubble wrap around it and it was fully intact, no bent corners no cracked mirror and all the eye shadows are perfect. Thank you Lorac for the amazing product and thank the lord Amazon is trying to protect it during shipping now (better late then never)",1
It was expiring in one month...,0
This product has to be one of the best nail care essentials.  I was never able to wear my pretty Essie colors without them chipping within 24 hours.  The Chip Skip has enabled me to wear all my polishes for a good 5 days before slight chips!  Love this product!!!!,1
This product is the first I've tried that actually works! It smells really good too!,1
The hair keeps snagging on the comb because of how it's made. And the plates are too slippery,0
"Clumps a little, not as good as my regular brand. Will not purchase again.",0
"Let me start by saying I LOVE the Grande PRIMER. As such, I had high hopes for the mascara. Which is fine.....if you like goopy, gloppy, horribly clumpy lashes. That's it. Just goopy, gloppy, and horribly clumpy. No volume. No real length. I had to comb my lashes and apply my usual mascara to get it even looking halfway decent. A very disappointing product, especially since their primer is such a champ. :(",0
"Love it, pretty color",1
"I have only used it for about 3 weeks, but using it faithfully...I can see some growth to my nails and they are seem stronger. I am very happy with this product!",1
I have suffered horrible eczema on my hands for years. I replaced my hand soap with this and my hands have healed perfectly and look like normal hands for the first time in a long time! Excellent product!,1
"I'm very pleased with this curling iron. I needed something smaller than the 1"" and this one is perfect. It heats up quickly, has a good spring closure and rolls up easily. The cord is a little longer than usual, but that is not a problem. I would highly recommend it.",1
No results,0
"Awesome product - works great, but $35 if way too much.",0
i want this toothbrush replaced.  it cost $200 and it just quit working.  it should be replaced ASAP.  WHAT DO I NEED TO DO.,1
"I am giving this product the entire bottle worth to work for me.  So far, it has not improved my fingernails at all - in fact, they are breaking off in a new and different way.  I will do an update if I ever see improvement.

Jan 26  -  I have now given up on this product.  It made my nails split which they weren't doing before I started using nail envy.",0
"In the summer I get more tanned due to being outdoors and I can use bronzers without appearing too artificially shimmery. I still classify this as an evening /night time product, a natural glow is better in the day time! For night time this bronzer works nicely for me, it adds just a little shimmer without being too glittery.

 I usually don't wear a lot of make up or foundation but if I am going to use a bronzer I first put on on some foundation for best results as it is not really meant for bare skin. It's good to brush it over arms and neck as well as I want them to match!",1
As Always Perfect,1
"After 3 uses, the product was close to done. Not worth the price.",0
"Fragrance is not listed in the ingredients, but the product definitely smells scented.  Other than that, I like how it lathers, and would have given it probably 4 stars.  So, if you are not sensitive to fragrances, give this a try.  BUT... If you are sensitive to fragrances, pass on this one, it may bother you.",0
"Pretty color. Product coats like paint, feels dry and annoying, does not last long, have to poke/jimmy the applicator brush frequently to keep product coming. I don't plan to buy again.",0
Excellent product,1
"I purchased this wash for my son who has angry acne all over his back and shoulders. After reading good reviews, I was hoping it will help with blemishes and scars also. I can tell after using it daily for two weeks nothing changed. He still have all the acne and It's getting worse. He tried several other products out there except clean and clear.",0
This make up goes on smoothly and coverage is good; it does what it claimed to do.  I have to amendmmy previous critique since I just realized that the reason the pump wasn't working was that there is a safety shield to be removed.  Works great now!,1
The polish streaks and looks terrible!,0
"Ive read about negative experiences with purchasing this product so I felt the need to post my own review. I received the product today, it is exactly how I expected - the same consistency, smell, color, etc. as the product I purchased at a salon. Ive used Paul Mitchell Tea Tree for over 15 years and this is definitely the best bang for your buck!",1
This is a wonderful warm fragrance.,1
it really does dry up white heads and pimples,1
Thank you for the fast delivery! It glides on my hair so I know my hair is happy!,1
"The best thing about this product is that it's absolutely weightless!  Works well with powder for minimalist, fresh-faced look.  Offers a little sun protection while helping to give a smooth even look to the skin.  When you pop off the cap, turn the tip and squeeze gently to dispense product.  Nice so you know it won't just come loose in your bag if the top happens to come off.",1
My package was empty when it arrived!! Please advise!!!,0
"Glorified Vaseline. Obvious from ingredients, but they are not hiding it. Active ingredient, ""Petrolatum 56.8%"".  Vaseline is 100% petroleum jelly (also known as petrolatum).  I guess I thought there would be more to it. So a bit pricey but accurate product.",1
"If you have thick coarse hair like I do, this blow dryer is for you. It has more heat than any more expensive blow dryers I ever bought. A couple of draw backs to this product: the removable air concentration nozzle keeps falling off, and it's heavy -- which is why I didn't rate it as 5 stars!",1
you might need a special shampoo to wash youhair,0
"Supple skin without looking like I have anything on my face.  I use sunscreen over this to help with blotchy skin! Tingles a little bit but overall a great product, no issues here. Oh and you don't need a lot of product to get results.",1
"the shampoo itself works well giving volume to my fine hair. It would be better though if it comes with a pump, just to control the quantity i need.",1
"Great little travel iron. It is true dual voltage, but you will need an adapter plug to fit outlets if traveling outside the US. This iron heats very quickly and the perfect size to stash in a carry on or purse.",1
Great Shampoo.  Cleans well and seems to give hair more body. With both the shampoo and conditioner you only have to use a small amount.  Like the size of a Nickel in your palm. Seems to go a long way.,1
"HORRIBLE hairspray....save yourself $30 plus dollars a can, and go buy the cheapest aqua-net type hairspray you can find.....smells bad, leaves residue, such a strong hold (I like strong hold but this was ridiculous) hair looked stiff.  this is probably one of the worst hairsprays I have ever tried and for the price especially",0
"I've been using this for a few weeks now and bought it specifically to help with my KP-the little red bumps on the back of my arms and forearms.  I was encouraged to purchase this wash based on other reviews, but after using it am not impressed by this wash. The smell is too perfumey for my liking. Save your money and just use a mild body wash and sponge and then moisturize right out of the shower with Cerave SA cream or Amlactin.",0
"This is a fake product! Please do NOT buy! I'm so upset! I've bought this exact product from this vendor before and not had an issue until. Ow. I used it for the first time today. The smell is different, consistency, texture everything is different. And it's even sticky! If pureology has changed their formulation I will be glad to rescind this review. Otherwise DO NOT BUY!",0
Looked good for less than one day before polish and top coat started to peel off from the edge of my nail.,0
Too light,0
"This is the fifth bottle fo Butter I have purchased and the $15 price tag, while I feel is worth it for the 3 free and amazing color palette choices, there is just no justification to purchase any more polish the chips away at the tips in less than 24 hours. I will use all the willpower I can muster not to purchase another fabulous color only to be dissappointed when I must remove it a day after application, sorry Butter, you will need to improve before I spend another $15.",0
Very difficult to use.,0
Easy to apply-- but Creates dry flaky skin.,0
"My favorite Coola product.  I hate having anything on my face and have looked for a non-oily feeling sunscreen for years.  Other products claim to be dry to the touch, but the tinted Coola is the real thing.  I used to use Neutrogena, but it caused me to break out.  I now use Coola tinted as my everyday sunscreen. I have not noticed any of the tint staining or running.  I have tried a couple of other Coola sunscreens, but this is by far the best product for texture and absorbency.  Highly recommended.",1
"I bought this for my husband, along with the Billy Jealousy Hydoplane Shave Cream and he just loves it.  His face feels much smoother after using these products than it did with his old shaving cream.",1
Great product for a great price! I love the packaging because is well protected.,1
I love my new curling iron. It is very efficient and gets the job done! I do not notice any damage of my hair which I was scared of little bit. I recommend this product.,1
"It is my second time using of this.
I want to continue to use this.
I have large pores and texture is good.",1
I love love love this product and the entire product line.  I usually only get the cream so I was excited to find the lotion.,1
"This little palette carries my favorite eye shadow colors. Throw in the blushes and bronzer and the tiny travel brush straps inside - it is just unbeatable.  It comes with 2 brushes, you can change out for your own favorite small travel brushes.  All shadows and blushes are highly pigmented and full size; however, the unit fits easily in a small crossbody bag. Add your favorite lipstick and you're good to go.  I carry one in my purse, and have one in my makeup bag at home.  The ""Shell"" color (lower light shadow) is matte, the upper light color is lightly pearlized - perfect for an under brow highlight.  The ""Mink"" color (far upper shadow) is the perfect crease or  liner shadow color.  I am over 50, fair and my hair is blonde with very light and some gray/white streaks - and this palette works for me.  Love it!",1
Glad I bought the roller ball.  I didn't care for the fragrance.,0
"I saw this color (Rosie Lee) at Nordstrom and I needed to have it, but they were sold out.  So glad Amazon has it.  It's so beautiful, I can't stop looking at my nails.  Two coats is all I need, it dries quickly, and lasts a decent amount of time.

EDIT: I really have to drop this down to 4 stars because it chips so quickly, especially compared to some other glitter polishes I recently purchased from Sephora by OPI.",1
Broke within a year,0
"It works well, but sometimes it doesn't hold the curl as well as I would like over time. Would still recommend.",1
"Very disappointed with the order this time, eyeliner already drying up and have never left cap off, no reason for this! It cost way to much for 3 weeks and it's basically no good!",0
"Follow up:
This cleanser is meh..I haven't gotten any great results since using Google it. Wasn't worth the cost.",0
Exactly what my nail tech uses.  Great for home use in between manicures too.,1
"Mine was for sure a fake. The tube was a different color than my ""Grow Brow"" formula I bought from a retailer, the barcode was scratched out on the package, and the tube only said ""eyelash formula"" on it.

The only reason I realized this was not the real product was when I noticed how frequently I lost lashes when I would wash my face.",0
"I don't know if I got a bad batch, or if it is the seller, but I've been using hardwired for 3 years now, and when I got the bottle, I turned it over to squeeze out (as it is a thick glue consistency) and it spilled out of the bottle...I don't know what that was but it wasn't hard wired",0
"I purchased two Butter polishes because the colors are so great and fun and of course the idea that since they are somewhat pricey, they must be worth it.  Thank goodness they were on sale.  The brush is not very good at applying an even coat as it tends to leave brush marks if you only apply 1 coat which I can live with since I am a two coat girl.  The worst part of the polish is the chipping and I even have to carry it in my purse in case it does chip to do a patch job.  Even with Seche Vite's Top Coat the polish will last a week at best which may be due to the less chemically harsh formula for the nails?  I am not hard on my nails but it still chips.  All I know is that with OPI or China Glaze, I typically go two weeks without chipping and I could even go a little longer if my nails did not start to grow out and you see the polish line....  Unfortunately, I can't in good conscience recommend the polish since I have to change the polish within 7 days (if lucky to get to 7)",0
"Some other reviewer said it felt like spreading yogurt on your face.  That's true, and like yogurt it's not going to take your makeup off. Be prepared to wash your face a second time with something else.  Nobody's got time for that, or at least I don't.  No noticeable improvement.",0
"I love Molton Brown and after experiencing Coco Der Mer lotion from a 5 star hotel, I was looking for this product. I understand that this Coco & Sandalwood is supposed to replace the old scent but it's so different! It's too strong and I don't like it all. I probably won't order again.",0
"smells gross, kind of sweat smell",0
"i had high hopes for this product since it's so expensive, but it doesn't hold like a regular wax pomade. maybe it's because it's water based. i had to use quite a bit to get any kind of hold. the best it does is sort of slicks your hair when you apply it when your hair is wet. if you apply it when your hair is dry, it'll just fluff it up a little. also, it leaves a weird residue on your hands. there's no oily residue on your hands, but it's more like little particles clumping up together. only thing i like about this product is that it did wash out easily, again, water based.",0
"Use Active C for >10 years. Love it totally although not sure whether or how much the product contributed to my youthful appearance. It's not cheap but never mind, if we women decide to take care of ourselves, no price tag is going to stop us!",1
Not what I thought. Still smudges,0
"I got this as a Christmas present 4 years ago, and after 4 years it died. Best straightener I have ever had. I have never been more satisfied. EVER. I bought another one and we are now reunited.. I would recommend for any type of hair.!! It leaves mine smooth and healthy looking. while most straighteners cannot even make my hair straight.. This one leaves my hair perfect.!!!!!! (: I am 100% satisfied!",1
"My skin actually improved quickly after using this device regularly.  However, it does not hold a charge for more than a few minutes now.  Disappointing.",0
Does not help it making the lipstick last longer than usual.  Not worth the price.,0
"It still smudges, but gives a good smokey eye look.  Clinique no smudge worked better for me and is about same price.",0
I use to love this product and still do but switched to Helmet Head to spike my hair.,1
"I had  been using the version of this product that contains SPF 15 (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anthony-Logistics-for-Men-Oil-Free-Facial-Lotion-SPF-15-2-5-oz/dp/B000HP7IM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anthony Logistics for Men Oil Free Facial Lotion SPF 15, 2.5 oz.</a>) and was very happy with it.  When I ran out, it was not available for purchase so I bought this version instead.  This version is very different - it is NOT fragrance free.  After I started using it, I began to experience serious eye irritation - constant watering, burning, severe redness, sensitivity and puffiness.  At first I thought it was pollen-related.  Finally figured out it only happened when I used this lotion.  I started tracking it - taking note on the days I used the lotion and the days I had severe eye irritation and they coincided exactly.  I was very careful not to get it near my eyes when applying it.  Only thing I can think of is that the fragrance was ""wafting"" up into my eyes.  Since then have found the other version and will be going back to it.",0
"This worked for many people, but not me.  I put it on my skin, at first, it feels really nice and soothing, then 30 minutes later, the area starts itching.  I tried it on my eczema spots on my face, didn't work;  tried it again on my body where the eczema spots were, same reaction.  Looks like it doesn't work for everyone.  Thankfully amazon allowed me to return.",0
Very good product.,1
"Great product. I have been thinking a lot about chopping my hair off. It has been so frizzy and gets knotted easy. But, I use very cheap stuff on my hair. I finally treated myself and my hair has changed. It could not find my brush this morning and I combed my long middle of the back length hair. I could not believe it. That is way I knew I had to write a review. I still am using a shampoo I bought for a $1.69.
The scent is masculine, so that is kinda odd. Scent has stayed in my hair all day, so it has staying power.",1
it works well for me.,1
It did not protect my skin from burning. It only had enough for 5 applications. I would not recommend.,0
"I got this because so many people raved about it but I had an allergic reaction.  There are only a few things I'm allergic to and I've never had an allergic reaction from using anything on my skin.  I think the sunscreen interacted something I was using and it literally burned my skin.  Someone said it looked like a chemical peel.  I couldn't put anything on my skin for a week.

After the allergic reaction, I just didn't want to use it again.",0
"This is great eyeliner!  I have used cheaper eyeliner's in the past that smudged way too easily.  This one goes on great, and lasts pretty much the whole day. In the evening I do notice a little smearing -- but usually its because I have been staring at a computer all day at work and have started rubbing my eyes some. It does take a little bit to dry when you apply (about 20-30 seconds), but once it dries, it stays pretty well!

It is my go to eyeliner now!",1
I use before and after styling.. I have alot of thick course hair and this helps me keep a polished look,1
"If you have fine tangly hair, THIS is the product for you.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this for after I have washed my hair.",1
Does absolutely NOTHING!!!,0
"And, the fragrance is solid and lingering, the container very attractive and stylish. Helps to disperse food odors. Would have been 5 stars if I didn't feel it's a bit too pricey. I think $12 to $16 would allow them a good measure of profit and be more reasonable for purchase. Thank goodness for editing! I almost forgot to mention - the packaging is the best of anything I've ever ordered anywhere. Not real easy to get into, but so very secure and protective!!!! Worth the effort to open, to be assured that the product arrives undented or scratched.",1
It concerned me bottle of conditioner didn't have a seal. When applying the conditioner I feel a burning sensation to the scalp. Shampoo takes forever to rinse out.,0
"while lighter and more convenient that the other KP regimen, it did not work as well as the other one.",0
"I have tried many different corrective sticks. I have an autoimmune condition which has left me with several broken capillaries on my face and these type sticks have proved to be godsends. I have a light complexion with if anything, a little bit of yellow so I have to be careful about getting any foundation or cover-stick that is too dark or rosy.

This color - sand - worked great. I put just a dab on after moisturizer. The directions tell you to layer the cover stick and I don't know why I hadn't thought of that before, but it does help. Personally, I have to put a little bit of a foundation (really a lightweight BB cream) on top to help blend it in.

I do recommend this. You may be able to find similar products that are cheaper but do know you are getting a nice, creamy quality cover stick if you go with this one.",1
I like this product because it is sulfate free however it drys my hair out even more than it already is.,1
"The tint is a little dark for my fair skin, but in the summer it just looks like I got a little color. Like that it dried matte and feels like nothing. However, sometimes it leaves my skin too dry, so I can not use it all the time anymore.",1
I absolutely dispise drying my hair due to the thickness and texture but this dryer shortened the time and kept it less frizzy.  Didn't know a dryer could make such a difference,1
"this item came with a faulty push pump. it does not function, request an additional pump be sent....",0
Great,1
This product works quite well at covering up thin areas . It is a little bit messy to work with but worth the cleanup. This is a product I will continue to stock,1
"Full disclosure, I've bought Mama Mio Tummy Rub Oil for all three of my pregnancies, and I used to give it 5 stars.

Too long didn't read summary: I just don't feel like there's anything magic in the bottle although I do feel that using some good oils can make a difference. I also would never use the perfumes on my baby and generally avoid them while pregnant.

Still reading? Here's the ingredients and why I'm changing my rating.

Almond oil, avocado oil, coconut oil, argan oil, sacha inchi oil, rose hip oil, olive oil, vitamin E, and the rest are all perfumes (Parfum, Limonene, Linalool, Citral, Citronellol, Evernia Furfuracea Extract)

Something you should realize about stretch marks is that they typically come in the very, very end. All those reviews where people say they've used it for less than 37 weeks? Ignore them. Also, the best person to compare the effectiveness of any stretch mark prevention is immediate family. I did get stretch marks, but they were not nearly as bad as my mother and sister and my skin has rebounded soooo much better, so I felt that the former Mama Mio tummy rub oil was effective.

So why did I change my rating?
1. I think I liked the old one that I used for my first 2 pregnancies better, it seemed to go further for the amount that you used. I really wish I could see the ingredients. They also changed the smell slightly, and I don't find this one as nice, but that's not the deal breaker . . .
2. I finally translated the ingredients and looked them up. The EWG has articles not recommending some of the perfumes listed because they are potential allergens that should probably be avoided with infants. So even though I'm not bothered with the smell and it's not deadly or anything, it's probably best to avoid this product for that reason alone. And yes, during the third trimester babies actually can smell your perfume.
3. Although the oils listed are good, the price is terrible, especially if you pay full price.  For example, almond oil can be purchased on Amazon for $15 for 16oz. The only oil listed that can't be purchased for a fraction of the cost of a bottle is Sacha Inchi Oil, which is number 5 on the list anyway . . .

What's a pregnant lady to do? I'm probably going to use up the rest of the bottle and then try make something on my own. My midwife recommends coco butter and olive oil. I've seen several recommendations for rose hip oil and essential oils such as lavender, geranium, and frankincense. Some combo of that or essential oils with any of the oils in this product is probably just as effective minus the perfumes and the overpriced glass bottle. Good luck!",0
"This product is OK at best. Received as a gift after reading lots of positive reviews. The smell is nice and the plastic bowl is convenient. The big problem is residue and lack of lubrication. I have a water softener and I still get lots of residue on my razor, in my sink, anywhere this soap touches. I have used other shaving soaps and never experienced this amount of residue. It does come off with any bathroom cleaner/soap scum remover, but what a hassle. The second issue is that it is not very lubricating. It pulls badly even with a fresh blade. It is like shaving with cheap bar soap. I will definitely try something else next time",0
I love it can't say anymore for me. My daughter had it first & I was using her's and bought my owns. I like it,1
"a little bit lighter than my skin tone , just a tiny little bit . but after I used it ,i realize my skin looks awesome ! natual and pretty !",1
I really wanted to like this... But it was just a bit not my style.... Sort of like a man orchid. :/,0
This product arrived a powdery unusable mess. I would not recommend this to anyone. If it would of been packaged better I might of been ale to use it.,0
So disappointed.,0
very nice shave cream. Clean scent.,1
"I like this product, but it does not give great coverage. It's probably more for if you are flushed or have a rash. Not the best at covering cystic acne.",1
The rubber piece on the eyelash curler quickly fell off and I was not able to use it.  The extra rubber piece they offer did not fit.,0
"Not meant for anyone with somewhat oily skin/hair. Despite thorough shaking, it just made my hair wet without making my hairdo last a second day.",0
The applicator is worth it.  It does make it easy to apply right where you want it.  I'd buy it again.,1
So I bought the little bottle first to see how I liked it. I didn't use much each time I used it. Only was able to use it twice with that little bottle before it was empty. $22 for doing my hair twice? No thanks. It wasn't that good for that price. I honestly didn't see a difference between that and no product.,0
"This product costs quite a bit, which would not be a problem it worked. I used the whole jar but didn't see any changes.",0
Light and moisturizing. Smells good and simple packaging. I have sensitive skin and have no problem with this toner.,1
"Mitzi (lime green matte) is a pain in the rear. Goes on streaky and dries as soon as it touches your nail (making it hard to paint in a smooth, streak free way). I will try again over a white base coat. This is by far the worst polish I have received from Zoya.",0
Love it!,1
This is a great product. I love that it is one of the only cleansers that will not leave makeup residue on the wash cloth and yet is very gentle and PH balanced.,1
What a worthless junk and waste of money. This will look like a soot on your head and your scalp better not sweat otherwise it's gonna be a mess.,0
Excellent,1
didn't like the smell,0
Tiny container. I've never seen toppix in this size but ok. Not great size but toppix is great. Hopefully this is the real toppix in this weird container,0
"I thought using this would help tame my acne/oil problems. I've had problems with acne for close to 15 years now and if anything it made my skin worse. After only using this soap once, my skin became red & I could feel bumps coming up under the surface. It smells really good so it's currently serving as an overpriced air freshener in my bathroom :( Overall disappointed in the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil line.",0
"I could easily overlook the Pine-Sol-ish top note of this at first application, because it wears off in about 15 minutes. But what replaces it is a vaguely grassy chemical scent with no depth or subtlety. And it only lasts a couple hours, so by the end of the day it disappears without a trace. Kind of reminds me of the old joke: One old lady says to another, ""The food at this place is disgusting!"" and the other replies, ""Yes, and such small portions!""  Incidentally, since this is allegedly a man's scent I had my husband try this out a couple times for my enjoyment -- though it turns out I didn't enjoy it, and neither did he. And I (a woman) tried it myself a couple times, since I find many grassy, woodsy scents work for me. No dice. Unfortunately, this is a miss for Varvatos.",0
"Did absolutely nothing for me, it left an odd scent in the morning that would last all day. I used it till I finished it and it seemed to irritate my skin more than it did help it. Was extremely disappointed in the quality for the price. This may not work for you if you get stubborn under the skin acne, like me.",0
The product started leaking everywhere when I tried to use it. I haven't had this happen before but it definitely wasted a ton of product.,0
"OMG ! I am in love with the color , it's like a latte mocha and the finish is just what I wanted , it came well package fast and in perfect condition . I am a fan of the Butter London products and this one is one of my favorites because the color is beautiful and is moisturizing my nails .love it !",1
Uncompleted perfect!,1
Still made my skin oily and must have an ingredient that causes redness and rash. Very expensive product that does not work for my oily skin,0
"wrong size, my fault",0
Thank you for the product!,1
"Great for dry damaged hair, makes it look shiny & healthier.",1
Must not be the real thing.  Looked beat up & white balls on the ends of the bristles came off immediately.,0
"This dry champoo claims to be extra-gentle, but the perfume smell is so overpowering I can't use it.  If you are sensative to perfume do not by this product.  I have no idea if it works well as I can't even put it on my over sensative skin.",0
"Love these rollers so much that I bought one for my daughter as well. They heat up quickly in about 5 mins - there is a red dot on one of the curlers and when it turns white, they are ready to use.  It comes with grip holders as well as prongs.  I never used the grip holders before thinking they would leave ridges in my hair but they didn't and I found they were even better than that prongs in holding the hair in place.  Even though the rollers are covered in foam and not spikes, they hold fine (at least when you use the grip holders; probably would hold less well with the prongs).",1
"Was looking for a dark purple. This looks more like a Burgundy, like Essie wicked.  I'm sure this was my mistake",1
"I don't know if I doing something wrong since people seem to universally love this product, but this was the worst product I've ever used. I have thick, curly hair and I usually style smooth, loose waves. This product left my hair extremely dry, more than I would expect a dry shampoo. Worse, it left my hair sticky/tacky/covered in residue. I usually try to rub it just near the roots of my hair, but even then it's too intense. I've tried to use it as a texturizer, but it is so drying it makes my hair brittle and break.",0
"Ive always loved St. Tropezs tanning products and have used them for years. I saw this fast drying one, and thought it would be easier. I used it for the first time before my vacation last week, and it was so wet and sticky while waiting the 3 hours! I didn't even want to put clothes on or sit down for fear of it getting ruined! I waited over 3 hours to try and get it as dark as possible, but the next day I just looked orange! Color was not dark at all, and it was straight orange unlike their other products. My hands looked terrible even though I hardly swiped over them like I always do. Very upset I cant return this or exchange it for their regular product. Dont recommend! Now Im stuck with crappy self tanner and out $45.",0
"I used the whole thing, but never noticed any difference on my skin. Very disappointed!",0
"What I like most about this product is the use of natural, cruelty-free ingredients.  You can see for yourself on the product page, but I'll repeat it here in case you missed it: Cruelty-Free, Vegan, Gluten-Free, Sulfates (SLS or SLES) Free, Paraben Free, Petrolatum Free, and Mineral Oil Free.
Key Ingredients: Saw Palmetto, Safflower Oil.

However, for the same reason, do it yourselfers may want to try mixing up their own blend of safflower oil and a plant like saw palmetto.  I can't guarantee the same results (smoothed and soothed skin, nice sheen), but if you have the time...

Tip: Use only a little at a time.  As noted by others, this has a palpable scent; pleasant to some (including me) but  perhaps not to others.  In addition, many people will find that a little goes a long way.  It's very slick and not all that viscous, so it distributes itself fairly easily. For this same reason I would NOT recommend this as a shaving product as mentioned by one reviewer:  That low viscosity will have the product dripping down your face as you try to shave.  Nice bottle color, very portable, and storage is easy.",1
The same thing has happened to me on 4 different cans!  Starts out working fine and then 1/3 - 1/2  through the can it stops working - it will not spray anymore!  I have a new can right now that won't work at all.  I paid like $16 for mine.  I think Amazon is selling the defective ones!,0
Way more transparent than I thought. Pretty color with fine glitter. It's nice as a tint of color. Need 3-4 coats for opaqueness,1
"Love this product. I have coarse, thick hair and the oil really helps with that. Just wish it was cheaper!",1
This one worked great.,1
"I decided to buy this product when I saw all the fabulous reviews. I was so excited when I got it on the mail and decided to try it the same day. I used it for a week and did not see any improvements on my hair; did not control the frizz or made my hair silky. The only good thing about this product was the smell. It smells great but I would not call it a hair treatment. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone, the price is also outrageous.",0
"I have been using the Clarisonic for a few years and have felt rather ""meh"" about it.  Brush heads seemed to irritate or feel harsh on my sensitive skin.  In fact, I only used my clarisonic a couple times a week because I was not looking forward to it.  I tried many brush heads and just could not find one that felt nice.  Then I read about this one and decided to try it and I'm glad I did.  It's so much softer on my face, so it no longer feels like I am rubbing sandpaper on my face (yes, i make sure not to press hard while using the Clarisonic).  Not sure if it's doing much to improve my acne though, but it's not making it worse.",1
"My father Billy Moore Four Lords a Guyanese music band back 1950's had to have a beautiful facial skim all the time ,until he older years he had this blessing but this is not my case that is the reason that I been buying this product and using  it and I can see a positive big difference on my face.",1
"This moisturizer is great if your skin is in good shape (ie: not in the midst of a huge breakout or super dry) but might not help if you're dealing with either. It smells very faintly of a classic sunblock, is white, thick, and easy to spread but dries clear. Over time I've noticed my skin looks more even in tone, and it doesn't make my face greasy. The only downside is how it gets flaky near the hair line and eyebrows. In this case it looked slightly like I had dandruff. Otherwise, if you have combo skin and want to use something that won't make you break out but moisturize your skin, this is a great product.",1
Very Good,1
Very awkward in the mouth due to thick neck and handle portion of the brush...actually clashes with your teeth,0
Matched my skin tone perfectly!  I can't believe it since there's only one shade.  It's very natural looking and very light.,1
easy to use,1
"Not 100% sure why this is so well loved- I have found that it does help take off stubborn mascara but honestly no better than a regular than a damp washcloth. I use fairly heavy waterproof mascara, and I find that even after using the makeup eraser I wake up with black smudges. I personally recommend a damp washcloth and nutrogena naturals makeup removing face wash to get all of that good stuff off!",0
Hi! Love this toner work very well.,1
"The container is only half way full! I have had good results ordering in the past but not this time. Would love a replacement please, this is ridiculous for the money spent!",0
"This is the first time I've tried this eye serum, so I'm not sure if this is typical for this product or if I just got a bad bottle, but it has a thick, sticky consistency (and ugly yellowish color) that makes it difficult to pump from the bottle and apply to the undereye area without pulling the skin (counterproductive for a product that's supposed to help wrinkles). Other serums I've purchased, even in the Osmosis line, are usually thin and slick and glide on the skin.  I can't say how effective this product is, since I've just started using it, but simply based on the consistency, I don't know whether I'd buy it again.  If I do continue to use it (possibly thinning it out with the Clear Plus Activating Mist before applying will help), I'll update my review with results, if any.",0
"Kinda funky smell, earthy. Smells great after the shave but during its a bit much. But lathers up fast and thick. I prefer it to the Poraso sensitive in the white. The cooling menthol is a bit too strong on the sensitive. This is just right.",1
It is the hardest eyeliner I have ever tried to use.  Will never buy it.  Got in my birchbox.  Just looks sloppy.,0
I received this item the other day. It was packaged very good so I know the damage didn't happen in the shipping . Also I received it in a timely manner. My problem is the stuff won't work. It won't pump at all. I am so upset!,0
This is NOT Express Tan! It is the Tanning Mist.  The box says Express Tan as does the ad but it is NOT! Disappointed and going back!  I spent $47.20 for EXPRESS TAN not TANNING MIST !!!  Would give it less than one star but it wouldn't let me.,0
The product is excellent.  I have dry sensitive skin and so far this is working for me. It is very cooling and refreshing. I do not like the glass bottle since I keep this in the bathroom. I am concerned it will drop and break.  The spray nozzle does not work and this is a bit frustrating but the product itself is very good so I will deal with these small inconveniences. I will probably re-order but transfer product into another (plastic) bottle.,1
I  totally love this product. I would definitely tell my friends & family about this product.,1
Love this color. Very bright with little application.,1
Love it....nothing else needs to be said.,1
"Great if you want to straight curly hair.
It is a spray, so don't expect your hair to feel soft.

I have curly and thick hair. Nothing would make it stay straight. This peoduct makes stay super straight all day!
However, it does make your hair feel heavy and you can also feel the product on it. Just like when you apply hair spray to your hair.

But I love how my hair looks!",1
This is the second safety razor I have ever owned and this one is more true to its name. It cuts relatively safe compared to my first blade (an ambrosely) I like how it feels. You can't expect the blade to do all the work though. You have to a wee bit of elbow grease. Not a perfect blade but great.,1
Nice glycerin soap.,1
This shampoo didn't leave my hair feeling the same as the bottle that I got from the salon.,0
"This time of year I have a lot of problems with dry skin so I was pleasantly surprised at just how moisturizing this cream is. It's very light weight and  almost feels like water when it touches your skin, and even more important it leaves your skin feel soft and moist for the rest of the day.  Another plus for me is that the fragrance is very light  and doesn't set off my allergies.",1
"nice fit, arrived right on time, thank you.",1
The product was broken.,0
The product is definitely the original.,1
Cannot get any shave cream on my brush. I recommend Taylor of Old Bond. Unfortunalty I waited til use until after I could return.,0
The foaming action is fantastic and it cleans the makeup off really well.  But this combined with the La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Epidermal Accelerator Pro Recovery Skincare is leaving my rosacea prone skin a mess.  I am suffering for more breakouts and flareups.  It looks like I am going back to the Toleriane line.,0
I like this spray because it not only gives a great shine but it really relieves the extra dry feeling and revive my curls from the frizzies.  using this and other agadir products has made my hair much less frizzy and hay like.  I honestly don't care that it isn't 100% argan oil or whatever; I care what it does for my hair.  Great products!,1
It takes a while to absorb into the skin and leaves the skin feeling oily. But most sunscreen are like that. The smell is tolerable and will dissipate. It didn't cause any breakouts. All in all not a bad product. Will order more.,1
Very disappointed. My bottle came almost empty and had leaked everywhere.,0
It's not as good as I was expecting. It's a clear gel that does not lather up very well. I have to use two applications to remove my makeup in the evening. It also caused some irritation on the skin under my eyes. I was hoping it would be better than it actually was...,0
"I tried this makeup a few years ago and when I ran out, tried some other brand and foundations.....I don't know why I strayed.....this is the best out there. It goes on as light or heavy as you want it to......it looks very natural and my skin is healthier when i use this versus foundations with oils, etc.

do not hesitate to try it.....and, it last a long long time",1
"A nice scrub to use, but don't use it everyday. Great feel and smell.",1
"This product did absolutely nothing, except irritate my skin",0
good balance of freshness and moisture but the spray isn't the best. Can't complain for the price but would be better to pour into a muji bottle.,1
"Its a great dark color, but you need to use the gloved to apply the product or else you will end up stained for a week!",1
"This stuff is EXPENSIVE but is NOT worth the money. Does not hold without putting a lot of product on, so this small bottle goes quickly, also, the slightest touch will make it flake. Bad product.",0
this is cool. does the trick. my only gripe is that the dark brown looks more black on my scalp,1
"I'm always looking for a better concealer for those darn purple circles under my eyes that don't go away no matter what I do. I've had one that was a different brand that came out as a liquid by twisting it like this, and that other one (that unfortunately I can't remember what brand it was) worked great. However, for me, this one was a no-go.

I found the cream that comes out to be oily and it didn't really dry at all under my eyes - I had to powder it. I guess I tend to prefer the ones that dry to a powder, or that are at least not wet/oily feeling,but those are so hard to find. I have dry skin, I do put face moisturizer on before my make up, so it's not that I have oily skin and so don't want oily. I just don't want a caked on feel, and I felt I had to do that by putting powder over it till it didn't feel wet/oily anymore.

This concealer seems to have a lot of good reviews and happy customers, so I guess I must be alone in not wanting that oily feel, or perhaps I'm missing something about the whole oilyness factor. I don't know - all I can say is that it's not for me.",0
The unwanted chin hairs that have been plaguing me have finally met their match -- these work perfectly and the pink swirls are even prettier in my house than they looked on the computuer screen!,1
This moisturizer made my sensitive skin turn red and burn almost immediately after applying the product.,0
Overly perfumed. Disappointed in this product that is targeted towards men. Smell doesn't wear off easily which is actually a negative.,0
You only need a small amount of the product and give you a lot od sud.,1
This really enhances my lame curls to beautiful and keeps them soft and bouncy.  I have loved this product!,1
This product made my hair sticky and clumpy. Gross.,0
"Brand new unit will do a dozen or so treatment flashes then turn off and give an error with a blinking orange light. I can reset unit by pressing and holding down the power button. However it will require another reset shortly thereafter.

Quite a costly item to have such an error with no guide as to what it means. Makes me fear trying a second unit in case the second one had the same issue.

Odd error message shown in picture below.",0
"$10 for basically a tiny little sample is absurd. Don't be fooled by the picture, this is a super small tube.",0
"Incredible pigmentation in beautiful usable shades for everyone from fair to very dark! It is LORAC, hard to go wrong! The cost of these full sized items alone would have easily been more than double what you pay for this set! The bag is easily large enough to carry 3 times the makeup it comes with and is really very cute! My only complaint is the brush on the mascara applicator, not loving it, but the formula is very nice nonetheless.",1
"I don't know why I didn't read the label b4 buying this, but this lip balm is going in the garbage where it belongs. It contains Petroletum, Avobenzone, and Octinoxate. SPF lip balms active ingredients should contain only Zinc Oxide or Titanium Dioxide. I'm going back to using my Earth Origins lip balm with ALL NATURAL ingredients!",0
Item received as described.,1
"I love the X L barrel. I have long hair that is thin, but dense so the adjustable heat setting is great for my hair type. It really feels like a professional tool other than no Auto Shut-off.",1
the spray tool can be improved! it get stack from time to time,1
I actually wish it were hotter. Makes nice curls but nothing ridiculously tight or curly. No auto shut-off meant it was left on ALL DAY once. How is there no auto shut-off on all heat products these days?!!!,1
Would not recommend this. As the day goes on it feels clumpy on your skin and does not hide acne scars.,0
Really not impressed with this product. Didn't see a significant difference in the shine of my hair. Won't bother buying more after this bottle is used.,0
"First I want to start with, I received this bottle and it wasn't full. There was room for about 1/8 more.
Second and most importantly, this conditioner is the only hair product change Ive made recently and since starting to use it Ive noticed a substantial amount of hair loss.
Third, When I came back to read reviews to see if I was the only one having problems I found others stating this was a counterfeit deal, so I looked at my bottle and the bottles look like Paul Mitchell BUT no where says Paul Mitchell on the front like a true bottle would.

Ive mailed it back for a refund.

How this is still being sold on amazon after multi reviews stating its conterfeit is beyond me. And how I missed those reviews also astonishes me.",0
Helps discoloration and gives you a polished look. All while protecting the nails.,1
Not the color that expected it looks darker in the pictures than it actually is,0
"I've been bouncing from one alternative deodorant to the next for several months now with mild success. The Anthony Logistics alcohol-free deodorant was attractive for its lack of aluminum as an ingredient. Through the initial use I did find that my underarms could tolerate the formula. Other brands have produced adverse skin reactions. Unfortunately, the lackluster performance of the deodorant to actively control and/or eliminate body odor was not encouraging. I could get through midday without any perceptible smell, but after lunch this product would not continue to work as desired. Sadly, I am trying to use up the stick by only applying it when not in the workplace (i.e. weekends). Your mileage with this product may vary. For what it's worth, I will not be purchasing this product again.",0
I've been using the Clarisonic Sensitive brush head for years and thought I'd give this one a try for a change.  My skin doesn't feel as clean nor does the Radiance seem to polish away dry skin as well.  I'm back to the Sensitive Skin one for next time.,0
"It is difficult to review a 1st wrinkle cream as I don't know how I would look without it. However, it seems like a good product; it has a nice cooling effect on the eyes.",1
Pretty!,1
"I really like this product and have been using for couple years, works great, easy to apply especially on kids. only reason i gave it a 4 is because i ordered the spf 50 and they sent me the spf 30.",1
"I love this line, it's 80% pure ingredients and does a wonderful job, my hair is waist length, and wavy so this helps keep it under control.  I go between this one and the LOVE one. been using it for years and I still like Davine's brand the best!",1
"somewhat tightens saggy skin on my neck temporarily when applied.  not worth the cost, will not buy again.",0
ok.,1
has really helped me get my hair back to healthy and normal,1
Helped balance and clear my skin,1
I'm addicted to this spray and use it daily. It is so refreshing and it works like a toner on my skin. I love it! The small size is perfect for your purse and I keep the larger bottle on hand at home.,1
"Total waste of $25.00 Honestly what a scam, you can dip your finger in sugar then get a $1.00 chap stick and get exactly the same results.
The only thing good about this is the tiny gold container--- that's where your $ goes
There's probably enough for 15 applications  Total Rip off",0
"I applied this product on Dermablend Quick Fix Body Full Coverage Foundation Stick, waited for 5- 10 minutes but it still rubs of clothing. Its a waste of money as dermablend will still smudge on clothing.",0
This lotion was recommended to me by a friend. It is very high quality and the scent lasts a long time.,1
I have used this product before. Clears up blemishes and sunspots. Skin is smoother.,1
Love it!! Been using it for a year and it's cheaper than buying it at a med spa,1
"FAKE FAKE FAKE - this is NOT Olaplex.  I am not sure what it is or if it is just really watered down, but it is not the same as I got from my stylist.  Buyer BEWARE",0
The Art of Shaving products are my husbands favorite part of the morning and the sandlewood fragrance is out of this world!  The shave cream lasts longer than you would expect.  As with all of their products-a little goes a long way!,1
"I have tried many night creams and after trying the day cream and serum I decided to give the night cream a try. I'm sure nothing will take away my wrinkles at my age, but my skin does look better so I'm very happy.",1
"I was a little nervous buying this without using it before, but after trying it I am glad I took the risk. It has a nice smell from the Orange Flower, Lemongrass, Lime, and Grapefruit extracts (though mild). I dip two fingers in and disperse through my hair, dry, and that is enough to get my hair to stay where I want it to (It won't slick my hair back, but will keep it off of my forehead). I have wavy, relatively thin hair.",1
"For a device that cost a lot of money, you would think that it will last more than two months. Just like many other reviewers noted, it will no longer charge. Waste of money.",0
love this product,1
"This is the worst purple shampoo I've ever used.. did not take out the brassiness of the blonde even a little.. The color of the shampoo is not the deep purple like most of the purple shampoos I've used, it's more of a soft purple which won't work for countering brassy colors..",0
"Zing!

No seriously, my wife loves this thing.",1
No creo son originales,0
"I think this was a special edition set and I drooled over it at Christmas time, but I was too busy buying presents for other people.  I finally purchased for myself a few months ago and am thrilled I did.  The shadows are extremely pigmented with very little fallout.  I'm not a huge blush person, but I've definitely gotten lots of use out of the contour and highlight shades.  I especially love the highlight shade, it's perfect for my medium skin tone.  It's light, without being too white like some others I own.  The eyeliner is fantastic, it really does stay all day.  The only thing I'm not crazy about is the color of the lip gloss, but I've passed it on to someone who will get more use out of it than I will.  Overall, I'm thrilled with my purchase and feel it was an excellent deal, especially since I used a 15% off luxury beauty coupon when I purchased.  These are my first Stila products and I'm definitely a convert!",1
"Works like a dream as long as you catch the pimples before they reach the surface. Once they breach, this does nothing and you're done for. I also really enjoy the fact that the pink usually rubs off on my pillow, because I always forget about it in the morning and shuffle off for coffee first thing, and I already look bad enough in the morning without pink dots scattered all over my face.",1
Wish they had made the liquid a grey color rather than piss yellow. Other than that it's awesome.,1
"This is the third SkinMedica serum I have tried, each has a different primary treatment target. I love HA5, I used it for over a month in the evening only. It comes out thick and one pump covers my face. A second pump covers my neck and chest. It immediately soaks in but leaves a thin, light feeling, non-greasy layer on the skin and feels like a protectant. The directions state morning and night or at least once a day. For me in these summer months I was NOT able to use it in the morning as it was just too thick for me to use this serum PLUS an SPF 46 facial product to protect my skin against sunburn and as a skin cancer preventative. I live in hot and humid Houston Texas which has strong sun and requires such a sunscreen every day. So, I used SkinMedica HA5 serum before bed. I have been trying different SkinMedica products for the last 4.5 months once or twice a day and have definately noticed a big change. I no longer get patches of dry skin, I have been getting less pimples (related to hormones or clogged pores) and less associated skin peeling from adult acne. I feel the fine lines and wrinkles which have begun to appear on my face are staring to erase away. Per directions this does not go in the eye area so the little crow's feet are still there. The texture of my face, neck and chest have been a more smooth, soft and supple texture, no crinkles or tissue paper skin anymore. I have been getting compliments asking what I am doing and why I look this good at 51. I am a convert to SkinMedica serums. Rating 5 stars = Love It.",1
You only need to use a small amount.  No harsh smells and cleans face and pores well.  No burning. Others often irritate my sensitive skin. Helps to clear mild acne.,1
I love the smell and my boyfriend loves the way it makes his beard feel,1
"I love the actual product. I was curious as to weather or not it was the authentic thing because of the tube it's in. When I purchase it from Nordstroms, the container is a heavier plastic that opens and closes easily. This one is in a cheap plastic jar and it is really hard to open and close. Makes me wonder if it's a knock off posing as the real thing.",1
"This diffuser does not fit my Babyliss PRO hair dryer, the nozzle is too small. Unfortunately, have to return the product.",0
Nail polish works great. Very log lasting.  Cool colors as well.  Really like this brand and will try other colors.,1
not good coverage  wrong color,0
Works very good had it for about two months now I have thick Indian hair and I am a male. My hair is kinda curly and works very well. Gets rid of the frizz but not too oily. You can still run your fingers through your hair without messing up the hair.,1
"I had read a review for these gloves that promised amazing results.  Too good to be true.  My hands look much better with Borghese hand cream.  I like that these don't have a scent, but that's it.  Won't purchase again.",0
"Best conditioner I have ever used - it made my dyed blonde hair unbelievably soft and the scent is strong but gorgeous. It's just so expensive for so little product, so I only use it occasionally.",1
I love it! Straightens my hair in just 15 minutes.,1
Not worth the additional cost.,0
I like the feel of it.  Haven't used it long enough to tell a difference--been using it about a week.,1
"Great Product! Color is perfect, just the right amount of coverage, doesn't make me break out or irritate my skin. That's huge for me because just about everything makes my skin flare up. Only thing is you have to reapply it once or twice a day. I highly recommend this product though!",1
"Very sticky, feels and smells cheap. However, it does wash out easily.",0
"The product was not sealed ! Did not use! Unfortunately, I miss my date to return!",0
This item was a lot smaller than I expected...but still works great! Heats up fast and straightens my hair well. I use to have really thick long hair but due to getting sick and on medication that makes my hair fall out I now have shoulder length thin hair. The straightener still works great and it's easy to make curls with it:) ...the only thing I wish it has was a tempurature setting,1
"I have used this product several times, so when I purchased it this time along with a new moisturizer ..I started experiencing breakouts like an allergic reaction. .I just assumed it was the new moisturizer ..so I have stopped using the moisturizer & I'm still experiencing the breakouts. ..I notice last nite immediately after I use this cleanser I had the tiny little bumps all over my face. ..I feel bad because I gAve the moisturizer a poor rating, when actually this cleanser is the culprit...strange because I've never experienced that before. ..& I can't use this product anymore.",0
I used these 5 or 6 times at the most and then they stopped working.,0
"It comes from Korea, so expect shipping to be strange. Exactly as expected. Smells Great.",1
Not long lasting. Feels greasy when put on. Have to powder over. Fades in spots during the day where it melts off. This makes reapplication nuisance because it is not necessary to reapply everywhere.,0
What I like about this face wash is it makes my skin very clear and doesn't have an overly dry/tight feeling after. I still use a moisturizer after use however. I saw results after a 5 days.,1
I was first attracted to this product because of all the positive reviews. I tried it for a few weeks and it only irritated my skin. I've had keratosis pilaris for several years now and have tried everything. I guess I have to go and try some more...,0
"If I could give this product a 10 Star rating I would.  I was skeptical when I read the easy to use directions.  A couple of sprays, swirl on a terry towel or paper towel and your brushes are not just clean, they are amazingly clean.  Don't know what the ""magic"" ingredients are but the brushes are almost completely dry immediately after use.  I left mine out over night, they were perfect the next morning.  I'm still amazed at how clean it got my brushes!!",1
Eh,0
"I do not like it. Is to dark for me, it looks weird on my skin. I throw it away.",0
I like the fragrancel of the product but it did not keep me from developing a smell throughout the day.  I went back to the regular types of deodorant with antiperspirant.,0
works well,1
"Love this scrub! It's amazing and leaves your body feeling so smooth. Not much is needed, so this will last long. Do not use on your face, as the directions say.",1
"This is a great little facial sponge, especially for those with sensitive skin.  It is only $18.00 at Sephora,com, so unless you like to pay more I would suggest you go there to purchase it. Plus Sephora,com has free shipping when you spend $50.00.
This sponge is excellent when used with a little facial cleanser. Rinse it out well and hang to dry. You can microwave a wet sponge for 1 minute to sanitize it. The sponge should last over three months with regular use.",0
Smelled medicinal.....not at all fragrant like citrus verbena!,0
it's well worth the price and it looks good when it's first applied but it doesn't last very long so it needs constant reapplication.,1
"I have very sensitive skin and many beauty products bother my eyes. I am very pleased with this product. (I accidentally bought the gel version first as the packaging looks similar, that one did irritate my skin)",1
It is a very light sunscreen perfect for daily use on tour face.,1
Great,1
Wasn't a fan!!!!! Too thick and smells weird.,0
"Absolutely LOVE this product, but ever since Amazon doubled the price, meh, not so much.",0
Great!,1
"I had always wanted to try this product, but through the years was always disappointed with other products, I noticed one day in salon hairdresser using this on customer, it was a different brand.  I still thought about it and one day my sister mentioned to me she was going to try this product, she did and well happy happy.  I decided to check online at Amazon, not only was the price far superior, but the product was even better...I am a happy happy girl, you could  see my scalp through my hairline, now you can't.  Thank you everyone Amazon for pricing and the product itself.  FABULOUS!!!",1
Has no staying power.,0
"I wonder if this was shampoo instead of conditioner.  Honestly, my hair was like straw wherever I put it on.  It smells great, but even that was not worth anything as it left my hair dull.  I gave it to my sister and she had the same experience.",0
"Easy to use, great results. Much more satisfied than other brushes I've used. Would buy again.",1
Omg sooooo pretty!!!!,1
So fake. Don't even worth get 1 star. It's a waste of money,0
"Good stuff, nice long hold.",1
Love it.,1
"NOT WORTH THE PRICE! This set of rollers is made of cheap materials and does not hold up. I have had this set for only a few months and several of the rollers have broken with only light use. It costs $10/ roller to replace the broken ones! Then the base cracked for no reason. When the company was contacted ,they offered to replace the set for almost the same price I paid for it on Amazon!!!!!! STAY AWAY FROM T3 PRODUCTS!!!!!",0
"I am having a hard time coming up with positive things to say about this product. It feels harsh on my skin, but also feels like it leaves a residue that leaves me dry, regardless of how much moisturizer I use. It has a really nasty chemical smell, too. Ive used enough to know Ill never use this product again.",0
"Smells high end! Love this! Works,great!",1
My hairdresser told me about this curling iron. It is the best one I have found for the most reasonable price. They even use it at my hair salon. It doesn't burn your hair and gives the perfect curl!,1
The best!,1
Disgusting. Does not smell like it does on my friend AT ALL. Straight from the bottle it is horrible gets worse when sprayed. Threw in trash.,0
The smell is way to strong and makes my face EXTREMELY sticky. Does not leave a clean feeling on your face or neck since it's so sticky (even when the cream dries up),0
"I'm still getting the hang of whipping a decent lather out of this, but so far so good. protects my face, smells good; but mild - i don't know how some other people find this has a pungent odor, i can barely smell it.",1
Loved the product when I bought the smaller bottle from Sephora. Was a bit concerned there was no safety seal but seller says it came without... Seems okay...,1
"Bought this because of the price, and the fact that it has a spray pump. I love the spray pump, but after looking at the store, realized I could find something very similar for cheaper at walmart. The product is good, not, but not amazing.",1
Product has started smoking after mild usage and only having it since late June 2016.  All my other dryers lasted for years and cost a lot less.,0
"*****Update**********

I gave Olaplex stand alone treatment another try.
But still nothing.
Last time, I left on step 2 about 45min - an hour. This time, I left it on for about 4 hours.
It made no difference.
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
I did the stand alone treatment. I followed the direction exactly, but there is no improvement on my hair.
To be fair, my hair is in really bad shape and I expected no miracle. Although, what it claims to do does make you feel like Olaplex should be a miracle in bottles.

My hair is below shoulder length and I am in process of growing out thermally straightened hair. I still have about 4 inches left. I use henna on my hair once a month to every other month (just root touch up). I use pure organic henna powder mixed with pure organic Cassia powder (3 (cassia) : 1 (henna)) and color with light ash blond. My natural hair color is black and I love the color this combo creates and I been rocking healthy locks for years doing the same thing.

One day... my scalp turned into itchy dry mess. I believe it's due to Aubrey's conditioner. They changed formula and package  and I used to use the original before the changes was made. The new formula was on sale at The Whole Foods and I remembered liking the conditioner a lot. The only reason I stopped using it was, the smell of the conditioner was too strong.

Big mistake.... My scalp and even my ears swelled red and started to itch. My fiance called my ears ""Goblin Ears."" After few hospital visits and steroid creams later, my ears were ok, but my scalp continued to itch and flake. Medicated shampoos, such as the tar shampoo dried out my hair to crisp straw. I couldn't find any conditioner that will not itch my scalp and make the flakes worse, so conditioning was out of question.

After few months of this, my scalp calmed down. But my poor hair is destroyed. My hair that faithfully remained healthy through many many lightening, highlighting and thermal straightening was completely destroyed.

I would've cut my hair off and moved on, but I have wedding in September. Yes, I am the bride and I need my shoulder length hair for my special day. I already picked out the style and bought the necessary and pricey hair jewels.

I don't believe in anything that claims to ""repair"" damaged hair. But out of desperation, I ordered Olaplex.

I am considering giving it another go before discarding it.
I will update my review, if I decide to give it another try.",0
Left my scalp worse than it was before!  Product was wattery!,0
"Used it before, couldn't get it from my hair salon. So I tried new product, liked this Surface product the best.",1
"I bought this at TJ Maxx.  It does smell nice.  However, it leaves my healthy/unprocessed hair dry and brittle.  Didn't finish using the bottle. Waste of money.",0
I love it!,1
"Excellent product quality, in awe of how big the tube of cream because it was thought to simply smaller but satisfied because exceeded my expectations. recommended",1
Left my hair very dry.,0
"Excellent eye cream! I can already see improvement! Lightweight.
Lines around the eyes appear to  disappear.
I use it twice per day.",1
Smells great and mt hair is very full.,1
These are better at removing glitter polish than cotton balls but not by much. I doubt I'll buy them again.,0
"I bought this mitt in a Sephora store and loved it while it lasted, but now it is tearing at the seam. A hole where my thumb is has opened. I've only had the mitt for a few months and only used it a few times. So, it is more of a disposable mitt than a long-term investment.",1
"Horrible moisturizer, i returned it next day - you can totally smell the alcohol and it looked it had been sitting in storage for a while, drying up from the sides. Did not sit well with my skin.",0
I find Sebastian Drench shampoo to truly moisturize my drier hair... it does work! I find Sebastian products true to their claims!,1
Not authentic! Stunk terrible!!,0
"good product, easy to handle",1
"First one lasted 6 years. Second one lasted 6 months and broke. I don't think they are as solid as they were before.

Update : after trying some other handles this one is better shave . Even though it break easy.",0
"I love, love, love this machine!!! My hair: very thick, somewhat coarse and almost to my shoulders. My hair will curl, it just won't hold curl for any length of time. Until now.  I sprayed my hair lightly with a little hairspray, waited a moment and tackled my mass of hair. Curl after curl after curl.  I didn't brush it out, just left it in the springy curls. It took a bit of maneuvering to figure out how to place my hair correctly at the back of head, but if I didn't get it right the first time, I just did it again. I lightly sprayed my ringlets again and went to bed.
The next morning, I finger combed my curls and my hair looked fabulous.
When I got to the office, my ladies I worked with also commented on how much they liked my curls. I told them about this amazing miracle curl machine. Their interest was piqued so I brought it into the office the next day so they could try it. Many different people/hair types gave this machine a 'whirl'. Some really wavy, straight, short, color-treated, medium length and really, really long. I also had the steam feature on. It performed beautifully. All the curls were done on the lowest temperature and shortest time setting.  I bought mine on Amazon from 'BeautyAnd' for about $129.00. Not the cheapest one listed but the one I got was authentic.
My curls lasted ALL DAY. This never happened before. EVER. Curling iron, flat iron, hot rollers, Curaso rollers, pink foam rollers, you name it, the curls didn't last. These did. And...the next day I only had to touch up four or five curls and it was another great, fun, curly hair day.  I suspect this amazing little machine got added to a lot of Christmas list after trying it out. There are different temperature settings, different time settings, steam or no steam and you can pick the direction of the curl or even alternate the direction of the curls. It isn't cheap, but I love it and I'm so glad I got this for myself for Christmas!!",1
This works great if you want to give your hair a little more body.  I use it to fill in my bangs area so that you don't see so much scalp especially in the sun.  Be careful when you scratch you head and have this stuff in it because your nails will get full of this black dust.,1
"I bought this machine because it replicates the Velashape concept. I had success with the Velashape and thought that it would be more convenient and cheaper to do it myself. Wrong. It is very awkward to hold, especially when doing the back of your thighs. And the cream you are instructed to rub on your thighs prior to using the machine wears off fast. You have to keep reapplying so that the machine can glide on your skin, and the bottle of cream is so small it fits in the palm of your hand. Unfortunately, I would rather pay the extra money for Velashape!",0
Good product which provides a better/closer shave. Worth the price.,1
"I ordered this for my wife, and she loves it.  So five stars for this mask.",1
"My hair is so very sad, damaged and unhappy since using this blow dryer.  Had to cut 3 inches off and am dependent on restorative treatments now.",0
Seriously best product and company ever. Have bought several times and will continue to!,1
"One of the draws for this iron is the static control for fine hair. It simply isn't true. I had lots of static issues with it and at this price, expected more.",0
"I purchased Mustela with high hopes only to realize that the smell - scent - odor - chemical perfume is totally  overpowering. We are asthmatic with respiratory allergies, and this product smells so strong it immediately made my chest tight and bothered us all. I wanted it to work for us but unfortunately it did not. Also, it made my hands very dry. Sorry for this review. I thought others should know.",0
I've been using this for several weeks now with the accelerator and a dry brush as recommended.  I also have a shade chart for comparison.  I see no difference at all so I don't know what a lot of the other reviewers are talking about.  Very disappointing.,0
NICE,1
"This is a great little facial sponge, especially for those with sensitive skin.  It is only $18.00 at Sephora,com, so unless you like to pay more I would suggest you go there to purchase it. Plus Sephora,com has free shipping when you spend $50.00.
This sponge is excellent when used with a little facial cleanser. Rinse it out well and hang to dry. You can microwave a wet sponge for 1 minute to sanitize it. The sponge should last over three months with regular use.",0
Have to use for 5 minutes in the shower with no water running which is difficult for me.  I don't really care for this product.,0
Not sure why I don't like this anymore...did they change the formula was Onesta bought out?  doesn't seem the same.,0
"2nd one I've owned. I let my 15 year old use it for a while and she ended up breaking the handle. That was due to her negligence not the design build. I own the regular size 1"" and the C curler from BaByliss, love all of them.",1
"Hurts my scalp, I feel it clogging up the pores on my head, I don't like using it, looking for a different spray. It does hold the shit there but so would any other spray adhesive shit. It smells and is painful to use for some reason maybe Im a puss idk. Id skip it",0
"The product is good,and was complete and send to me very quickly, was positive and i recommend it, is cool",1
nothing good!,0
"I dry my hair 3 or 4 times a week, and I usually let it air dry for a while before I ""finish"" it with a blow dryer. Unfortunately, this dryer didn't last very long (about 6 months). The low setting works, but the high cuts off the second I turn it on. I took the lint trap off, there was nothing in it. I guess mine was just defective because I understand that BaByliss has a great reputation.",0
Really works...amazing,1
"My husband didn't like this cream, he said it was burning him while he was shaving and didn't prevent nicks. wouldn't buy again",0
Great perfume for men. Not too strong but the ladies love it,1
"I'm a new Stila customer and was looking for an eyeshadow that looked natural. I don't want people to look at me and have my eyeshadow be the first thing they notice! While I would prefer the Kitten shade to come in a matte version, I figured out how to tone down the shimmer. I add a small bit of Marutaki Rice Powder, that I bought a long time ago from the Vermont Country Store, to the shadow right before I put it on. Works like a charm and doesn't change the shade noticeably. I'd recommend this product even thought it isn't cheap. It seems to stay put pretty much all day long. I'm not one to reapply makeup throughout the day, so I needed something with sticking power. :)",1
works excellent.,1
Beautiful body lotion I will buy again soon,0
Very strong smell.,0
"Fantastic hair dyer. Very powerful! Great price. Long cord. Everything that I wanted. Great shipping. Great price. Well recommended, thanks",1
"Great product, great seller, great price! ",1
"This serum goes on like silk and is very soothing to my skin.  It has reduced my pores.
I have been buying this product for 2 years now and will continue to purchase.  I never
pay full price of $85.00 always find good deals on amazon.com",1
"Do not order from this seller! Bottle defective, never sprayed right and now has quit spraying at all! Have hardly used any at all out of bottle! When you pay this much for it you would expect it to spray til it was all used up!",0
Pretty and different.,1
This curling iron works really well.  It doesn't take too long to heat up and it will curl my hair quickly.  I have thick hair so was concerned about how effective the curling iron would be bit it works great!,1
"This is a good product. I did not experience the same coverage as other reviewers claim, however. I bought this product because I read it ""covers everything"" and it is good for covering scars. Well, it does a nice job of covering up pigmentation problems and regular, small skin ailments. But I have some old acne scars on my cheeks and this does not cover them. It, like ALL other makeup I try to use to cover them, seems to actually enhance my scars. Of course not a fault of the product itself, and nothing will really cover your acne scars but if you were hoping to finally find a holy grail for your scars, keep looking. If you were hoping for a good foundation product that provides medium to full coverage for sun spots, pigmentation issues, etc - then this is worth a try.",1
"I sure love the way this feels going on and the wonderful, deep tingle that radiates into my skin after about 30 seconds. I also love the way it moisturizes. It's true, I wake up looking smooth and well rested. I really do enjoy using this night cream, despite the slightly annoying dispenser and the need to shake it really thoroughly before every single use. I'm just not sure whether it's doing all the amazing anti-aging jazz that it claims to do. I use retinoids and Retin-A, and I know those work because there's a wealth of clinical trial data and decades of proof. But for the price of this stuff, is it a quasi-magical elixir of aging reversal? I doubt it. But it is a truly excellent night cream that I look forward to using. Does that justify the price? You be the judge.",1
used the product fro two weeks. it appears to have helped with bumping and skin conditions I had before. I will give it another four weeks to see if it is as good as it appears to be. Two of my sons are testing it as well. So far so good.,1
I received a sample from PinchMe and this product worked great for me. Looking forward to buying my first bottle!,1
"I applied it out of the shower with wet hair and blow dryed my hair. It left my curly hair sticky/oily/heavy feeling, with no definition. I tried using it a few different times using varying amounts of product (wanted to give it a good chance) but I ended up giving the bottle to my boyfriend.",0
"I love this stuff!  Great pore minimizer and the tint is perfect.  But in stores it has been discontinued.  So glad I found on amazon, yay!",1
"My dermatologist recommended this to me and I like it quite a bit. My skin is constantly acting out as I get older (I'm 32) and it goes from dry and flaky one day to complete oil slick with breakouts the next. For the most part I've found a routine that works to keep my skin calm, but I was tired of paying $30 for the moisturizer I was using. This one is a bit less expensive and it is a good moisturizer, however, for days where my skin was really dry and flaky, this didn't do a whole lot for me. I use it every morning and night on my chest and neck and it has made a significant improvement in the tone and texture of my skin there. I do really like it and I would definitely repurchase, particularly during the summer when I want something just a bit lighter.",1
Great color but the brush is very tinny.  The color is beautiful but is does not last at all.,1
Love Love love it,1
Broken lid on bottles,0
Eyeliner comes off really easily. Gonna stick to my Kat Von D tattoo liner from now on. Its cheaper and doesn't streak.,0
"I bought this from Beauty brands.  I had it for less than a year.  It started smoking, then making loud noises then finally quit yesterday.  For the price I was hugely disappointed to say the least, don't waste your money!",0
"I wanted to love this product, but I just don't see any noticeable difference when I use this product or go without, let alone when I compare it to other similar products on the market.  I keep searching for natural, healthy products for my fine, wavy hair, and I keep coming up short.  The bottle did not last more than two months, either.",0
"This product is CRAP. It fails to remove red spots. Furthermore the directions are all in different languages none of which are English. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  It took about three weeks to have it delivered from GREECE.  I bought two of these tubes. What was I thinking about. I have used it for three weeks. Junk, junk junk!!!!!!!",0
"Just got it today! The 1 inch takes up a good portion of your hair.. Compare that to the one inch flat iron by babyliss.
I really liked this because it heat up quickly and left my hair shiny and extreamly straight! I have used babyliss before and this mini one is exactly just like it!  I loved it!  Worth every penny",1
"While I really liked it, it's gone up $12 since February.  Outrageous!",1
"It's a good product for home treatment.  It works differently on my hair though, even some hair in the same areas.  My chin still has hair not affected by this device at all, but my upper lip and my underarms are almost clear.  The effect definitely does not last for years.  I only used it for less than a year and I have to keep zapping those hair occasionally, but even if I do few zaps every month, it's worth it.",1
Clumpy,0
"I was very excited when this was offered. I get 4 ""beauty boxes"" a month all of which are less expensive than this and usually contain some really nice things.  When an item is advertised 'luxury' you would think there would be some pretty great samples or at least one full size product.  There were 5 perfume samples, which included two duplicates and two samples for men. Really? This was not worth the cost.",0
"Two stars for not causing any damage but not doing anything useful, either.  My main impression of this stuff is residual stickiness and I noticed no change in my skin.",0
Love it,1
"wonderful, refreshing product  makes skin so soft",1
I put this under my eye and within minutes I had a bad reaction. Red and blotchy and it stung...I would not recommend this product.,0
Great - Thanks!,1
"Awesome color, dark, but not too.
Has that metallic shine and lots of compliments.
Stayed on for over two weeks without chipping or cracking.
Makes your nails nice and strong, even with gardening & dishes!",1
Dried my hair out.,0
"it's a scent-free mascara.
smudged during wear
took several soap & water washes to remove most of it from my skin. Ultimately I used makeup remover.
took a few coats to achieve lash coverage.",0
Smelled great but couldn't burn it because it arrived broken. Was returned and issued a refund. I have used this candle brand in the past and they work very well.,0
Too much Dimethicone and irritating ingredients. It actually caused hair thinning.,0
"I had such high hopes for this brush. The large barrel size is fantastic, and the first few times I loved the way the long bristles held my super thick hair. But thus ends the list of positive things I can say about it. I've only had the brush for a month and already the vast majority of the plastic bristles are melted. I'm going to have to replace it, but certainly not with another Moroccanoil brush.",0
Don't know if it works yet because I just recently started using it.,1
"I have extremely oily skin.  It's also prone to redness and irritation.  Typically by the time the day is half over, my makeup is glistening, my eyeliner is somewhere in the creases of my shiney eyelids and if I try to have bangs, they are plastered to my greasy forehead.  Blotting paper can't handle the sheer amount of it, and if I keep applying power to absorb it, it just gets thick and cake-y - emphasizing any lines and making me look old and tired.

I finally found this and it's been a relief!  It goes on smooth and after a couple minutes disappears into the skin.  I too did not care for the smell at first, but now I don't even notice it.  This is not a full-coverage product.  If you have significant blemishes to cover, might want to consider a concealer, but it definitely 'smooths' everything out and diminishes the appearance of any, but it doesn't totally cover them up.  I have super fair skin as well, so I was pretty sure the color of the stuff that came out of the bottle was not going to match my skin, but I was wrong.  It looks quite natural.

The most important thing for me was that this not be too much of a moisturizer, and not enough of a foundation.  Moisturizers generally just aggravate my skin, but this doesn't.  It takes a couple minutes to absorb, and then I 'set' it with some mineral powder.  Best of all, I can go a full day without re-applying or needing more powder.  I practically feel like I have semi-normal skin now.  I can also go work-out in it without breakouts later.  This matters to me since I head straight to the gym from work and am often cutting it too close to remove my makeup.

In short, it blends well with my skin color, makes my skin look better with makeup than without it (surprisingly not a given with much makeup), and actually stays looking good all day despite my oily skin.  Not that many makeup products get 5 stars from me, but this does.",1
"Greesy, heavy and IT IS NOT A SERUM take that description off the product. Never buy again. Supergoop you goofed.",0
Its truly a divine cream. My skin looks fresh and this is not greasy at all. i absolutely love it. I even bought L'Occitane Immortelle Precious Night Cream its awesome as well. I even gifted my mom who loves it aswell. L'occitane rocks!,1
"Not worth the hype, very disappointed :( hard to get all of the ""scrub"" particles off of lips, does not wipe off easily.  I also purchased the Sara Happ Lip Slip, not bad, but definately not worth the money.  Save your money and skip this one.",0
"I realize that fragrance and scent are subjective things/experiences, but this L'Occitane Lavender is NOT anything like any lavender I've ever smelled.  I was looking for a true lavender scent, with some woodsy/citrusy hints, as this has been described by others.

But this product has a chemical-type odor (the 2nd or third ingredient, right before lavender oil, is ""fragrance""--this is a chemical mix, and not an essential oil.)  I found this to be a very acrid scent, and, it doesn't last--which begs the question, why would I want to wear something that smells this bad?  Sorta like, ""the food is terrible, and such small portions.""

I thought I could use it as an air freshener, but the odor was so bad, even my husband complained about it ""what IS that?  It smells like new car odor mixed with Pledge furniture spray!""  He was right.",0
I have this same straightener purchased from a salon for my daughter and this one looks like it but does not work like it it's a cheap knock off,0
"SMELLS FAKE. WASTED MY MONEY, ENDED UP GIVING IT AWAY",0
Love all Jane Iredale nontoxic cosmetics.  Highly recommend!,1
Smells great. My husband loves it,1
Used it for two days before the irritation set in.,0
Good,1
"In my work as a university supervisor, I require a professional appearance.  In my sixties, I have coped with thinning lashes as well as watering eyes.  Regular mascaras result in my looking like a raccoon.  Waterproof products are more acceptable, and yet I find them difficult to remove.  Blinc mascara lasts all day, without running or smudging. Best of all, it removes easily, with warm water, and requires no special make-up removal products.  I do not understand those who find it difficult to apply -- it goes on just like any other mascara.

All that being said, the product provides soft coverage which is not ""thick"" or ""lush"".  For me, this is fine, as I strive for a more natural appearance.  If you are looking for long, lush, curly lashes - or are attracted by the look provided with lash extension products, this would not be for you.",1
"Several annoyances: Does NOT feel like it reaches the high  temperature it claims to go up to. (And you can't adjust the heat setting; it only has an on/off button)  it's awkward and uncomfortable to hold because it's so small. You HAVE to clamp down with a little force to get it moving.  (Hand cramps, need to take breaks while doing hair, very frustrating). Then, the places where you hold the iron in your hands, get about as hot as the plates! (So much so that I wear a thick glove while using this flat iron) Also, it does not grasp my hair (the box says it ""glides through hair; no pulling, no snagging). I have the exact opposite problem with this iron! It pulls all these little hairs as I'm flat ironing and the "" glides through hair claim"" for me means that it doesn't hold onto my hair enough to actually iron it. I find myself going over one section of hair repeatedly, and still with less than desirable results. Overall, this iron is AWFUL. I have used the large version of this product and it worked amazingly so I'm surprisingly disappointed with this mini iron. I went back to using my old 5 yr old GV iron from Sall'ys. Wish I wouldn't have wasted $23 and out it towards a new GV iron from Sally's Beauty store.",0
Color is great,1
"Just the perfect one stop travel palette. Good neutrals, a hint of shimmer here and there, enough variation to mix things up, and all packing flat and handy.",1
This is the easiest brush cleaner I've ever tried. I love it!,1
did not like it at all. not sure how the smell is even close to Bergamot and Tobacco,0
"This product is okay-ish BUT the smell is HORRIBLE. Like, really really bad. I will not purchase again.",0
"This arrived without a protective seal on it - kind of gross, I don't think I trust putting it on my face.",0
"Im a hairstylist. I ordered this for a client, I have never had a product that was so horrible smelling. He and his wife both hated it!",0
"I have tried about 4 different products of this type. This would be next to last of the 4. I followed the directions and seemed to clump up at the base of the hair on the scalp. Sorry, not my favorite.",0
I have curly hair (3C/4A) and I only wash it once a week. I spray the product on my hair once every night and its AMAZING. I call it my miracle spray. Keeps my hair moisturized and reduces frizz throughout the week.,1
"Amazing line.  The best cleanser I have ever used because it deep cleans without removing your skin essential, natural oils.
My teenage daughters use it and it cleans their acne prone skin.  I can tell when they aren't using it because the skin is not clean.
It removes make up, sunscreen, dirt.  One tip:  lather up between your palms 1-2 pumps of cleanser and patiently cleanse for a 2-3 minutes, concentrate on the acne areas. It reduces breakouts and blackheads by properly removing bacteria.  You must use it daily for best results..
consistency is key like everything else.",1
I cannot believe how easy it is to put my hair in a messy bun!  I used to have to use tons of bobby pins!,1
"I have used this product for a very long time and really love it, however this will be my last order.  The past few times the product has not been full and runs out in a very short time.  Disappointing!",0
"I purchase this Product and all Paul Mitchell Products from a Profesional Hair Salon. I have used this Shampoo for awhile now and it dries out my Hair as well as causing Dandruff.
This Shampoo also caused me to break out with Rash and Pimples.
I am now using Nature Holistics Tea Tree Shampoo to cure my Dandruff and repair my Hair and Scalp. I am very disatisfied with this horrible Shampoo.
Nature Holistic Shampoos are great and sold on Amazon",0
remove the word linen - i thought this was a linen curtain its a plastic liner,0
Love this razor,1
I love it.  the sugar scrub is edible...  the color is light and great for keeping lips moist.,1
I love all of Jane Iredale's products. This is a light powder that provides great coverage while also being good for your skin. Worth the price and a little goes a long way.,1
It was all that I expected!,1
"Came on thick and streaky. Did not shine, very dull. Would not buy Vinylux again. This was the sheerest pink and was like a matte. Inconsistent coverage.",0
"this is just ok for me, its very thick and makes my face break out a little, I also don't really see or feel any benefit. I like some of strivectins products but this is not one I will purchase again.",0
Good,1
"Sorry. I wanted to like this but couldn't.  Smelled terrible!  But most importantly, I got sunburnt in less than 2 hours and I used it generously!  Will not buy again.",0
Purchased this product and the first day I used it the attachement piece flew off several times on the same use. This blowdryer is extreme heavy and the switch off/on buttons are not in a good location my hand kept hitting the switch buttons. I should have listened to the other reviews which said the same things I am mentioning. For the price I would not recommend this item.,0
"This stuff is not necessary and cumbersome.  I purchased a bottle of this at the Mall of America shop in Bloomington, MN.  It feels like tar on your face and wrecked my blade.  I don't see how this stuff can get good reviews...This ""system"" of over priced product is a farce.  Why is this little bottle $25?  Don't bother with this and buy some shaving cream..does the same job.",0
"This post shave repair is very soothing, cooling, and most importantly does not sting my face after I shave. However, I would say that the post shave spray does clear up razor bumps and burns. The bottle of this razor repair is expensive but it will last you for a while. I may not purchase it again because there is another product that I use and like called SkinTight that I don't have to wait on and I can purchase it at Walmart - Mart. If you like MenScience products like me then this certainly will not disappoint and is worth the try and the money for those who don't mind the price.",1
Really good 'light' but moisturizing body lotion.  Doesn't clog porous or make you feel like you have an extra layer on.  Worth the price!,1
Rich but not greasy and lasts long.,1
The TSA allows 100ml bottles (3.4 oz).  The largest in this set is 2oz.  good for an overnight trip but thats about it.  I assumed the large ones were at least 3oz.  A waste of time and money.,0
THE EDTA NEEDS TO BE REMOVED. BURNED MY SKIN.,0
I ordered two and both toothpastes had air bubbles in it and it was only half full of toothpaste.,0
"I am a first time user of Epicuren products but as a former esthetician I have had the opportunity to test and try many, many cleansers.  I purchased this cleanser, even though I thought it was rather pricey, based on the stellar reviews it received.  Epicuren seems to have a devoted following according to the reviews and maybe their other products are worthy of this adoration.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks, intermittently with other cleansers I use. I could not use this every day.  I found it to be rather drying and I do not have particularly dry skin.  One male reviewer said this was similar to engine degreaser I think were his words.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that but I do not find it to be a very gentle cleanser either.  It leaves my skin feeling a bit tight and dry like some acne cleansers might.  I don't like cream cleansers or milky cleansers or those that leave your skin feeling over moist but I also don't like my skin feeling dry either.  Goldilocks here.  If you like a squeaky clean feeling, or if you have rather oily skin then you may like this product.  Dry skin types or mature skin types will probably not prefer this cleanser.  Remember that stripping your skin of its protective barrier will only stimulate your skin to generate more oil to compensate.  Skin needs to retain it's barrier function.  It does foam nicely and one pump is more than adequate.  I did not find the scent overly citrus though I am not one of those people who are sensitive to scent.  It smelled pleasant but nothing remarkable IMO.  For my money I would not purchase this cleanser again.  I prefer the drug store brand Aveeno Sensitive Skin foaming cleanser.  Aveeno is about 1/3rd the price of this cleanser and my skin feels clean, and fresh without over stripping.  Unless one wears a lot of heavy makeup or have excessively oily skin washing your face 2x a day may not be necessary regardless of what many product lines lead you to believe.  I have found over the years that washing my face once a day and then using a mild toner or even splashing with warm water keep my skin looking its best.  I'll use this product up as it was too expensive to waste but only a few times a week.",0
I have extremely dry and sensitive skin. I have used this product for 4 days now and feel a huge difference in my skin. My skin is so soft and feels more hydrated the more I use this. It also cleans very well.,1
"This gel goes on exactly how I like.  It is a little pricier, but it has great hold, it looks great, and it is basically the only gel that I purchase anymore.  Very good stuff and you don't need to use all that much to get the look that you'd need to glop on other brands to get.",1
"Got it quickly, but the brush head did not come in a box - just a brush head with the little plastic cap and wrapped in white paper. Smells and looks like it's never been used, but who knows? And makes me wonder, did this ""fall off"" a truck somewhere?  Where did this product come from?",0
"I like this polish a lot, esp. for the purpose of not have bad chemicals in something that goes on my body. It does take two or three coats for good coverage though.",1
Item lasted 6 months before it stopped working. Contacted customer service in regards to a replacement and never heard back. Don't waste your money.,0
Product photo shows dispenser soap but what I received was very small bar of soap.,0
"Despite an interesting list of ingredients, including fragrance, the abundant thickening agents make this product difficult to use.  It has the viscosity of Play-Doh, and very slick slip agents.  There is no dipping of fingertips to remove product.  Rather, one must apply pressure and dig it out of the jar, but it does spread nicely.

I used this for two weeks with no apparent effects until about day twelve, when my skin began feeling tight and itchy.  Since I wasn't seeing anything happening, except redness, which isn't unusual for my skin, I got a bit bored and at the two week mark, switched back to my normal skin-care routine.

The very next day my husband told me my skin looked much better; the redness was gone.  He didn't know I'd stopped using this cream.  He just made the observation.  I was using it, but he came up with the testimonial.  Not recommended.",0
This is my third curling iron exactly like this! I purchased one for me to have at home; my daughter took it. I purchased another one for me at home and now a third for travel!,1
This doesn't work at all.,0
"Gets skin clean, I  use with mia clarisonic, but can dry normal to dry skin sometimes",1
Purchased as a gift.  Recipient was pleased,1
"I bought this brush in 1993 as a splurge. It was $89 back then. It's still in great condition today. I use it on my wet curly ends (with conditioner) to smooth them. Or on dry hair if I'm brushing it back, or just want to give my scalp a treat. The cushioned bed feels so good and the bristles are neither too hard nor too soft. I love this brush and would buy it again. Fortunately I don't have to since mine has lasted 15 years and still going.",1
Meh.,0
wrong color and once used cannot return,0
Didn't work very well.,0
This is NOT an 'all day' lip color. It was cracking and peeling 2 hours in. Not impressed.,0
This color was clearly blue. Not like the picture at all. I like it...but it wasn't what I wanted at all.,0
Product does not worK as advertised. Save your money and buy a toupee!,0
This is NOT a Clarisonic brush. The bristles are incredible course and feel like you're using sandpaper on your face. Im incredibly dissatisfied with this brush and do not recommend whatsoever.,0
Best mascara for long term coverage.  I have dry eye and this is the only mascara that will stay on when my eye waters.,1
great product,1
LOVE IT,1
"I have not seen any improvement and have been using daily for 4 weeks.  I should have known -- if it is too good to be true, then it is not true.",0
"i use it before but this one i got online is far more harsh than the one i purchase in store, although the price is good but i think it is a fake brush that broken my face. i'll just purchase in store afterwards for the safety of my face.",0
"takes a little practice applying, different from other concealers, but still great!",1
"Great product. Cleared up acne and blemishes in NO time. Better then taking antibiotics for a year. I highly recommend this product. However, I used to get this when it was $50 a bottle. It's shot up to $100. I'll just be more conservative when applying from now on.",1
Glad I purchased this. It's perfect and costs less than in store.,1
"Its natural and it isn't sticky
after using it several times a day
for volume",1
It smells so good and I think it has really helped restore my hair! Definitely buying again!,1
I have been using this for two years and love this line of products. My skin is sensitive and breaks out from products that have too much perfume.  This daily lotion is exceptional.,1
"When I first got this, I pumped some in my hands and rubbed it all over my face.  It looked shiny and awful!  I thought, I can't believe I just spent $30 on this junk.  Then I read that you could mix it with your foundation, so I took just a very small amount and mixed it. That made all the difference.  I got a nice, healthy glow and didn't look like a disco queen.  Having said that, I like it, but I'm not a devoted highlighter person, so for the price, I'm not sure if I'll get it again.",1
My favorite foundation. I use with Lorac matte primer for a great look that lasts all day.  I don't even have to touch up my oily t-zone.,1
"Can't go wrong with this really. I use it every week and haven't had any troubles. Anyway, that's the idea, it's so simple that it requires little cleaning/maintenance, and is very hard to break.

Note:
- Doesn't come with blades
- Real metal (great build quality)",1
"This stuff smells fantastic! I'm not sure it did anything for my hair, but I'll gladly use it as a scent.",1
I do lots of swimming and this product is very helpful in keeping my hair from getting to dry.,1
A favorite product!  Holds but doesn't put a coating of stiffness in the hair to maintain the style of my hair,1
"Been using this Shaving Soap for the last 6 weeks (5 days a week).  Builds up a nice lather on my Badger Hair Brush, enough for 2 shaves.  Gentle on the face.  Smells nice too.  Could use a little more lubricant in my opinion but I'm knit picking.  I'm only through about 1/3 of the jar in that time.  Should be equivalent to about 3-4 bottles of your favorite OTC shaving cream at least.  Good product that's worth the price if you are a Fancy Boy who care's about your Shave and Face like me.  Highly recommend.",1
"Too pricey!  But wonderful stuff!  Works great, and non greasy.  Perfect for face, chest, hands.  Please bring down the price... I know cosmetic formulating and the contents cost you two dollars or less...",1
"I bought this because it's travel size, but it's a very unusual mousse because it really is a pomade that sprays out like a mousse, it has texture and isn't just puffs of worthless bubbles that turn crunchy.  I have coarse, dry, wavy hair, and I love to use this on the first day I shampoo because it tames the fuzziness and adds some nice body and control.  However, by the 2nd or 3rd day post-wash I can't use it because it is pretty weighty and doesn't do anything for my hair.  Then I switch back to the old texture cream/conditioner/oi oil combo.  But for what it is, it works great.",1
"Not as advertised do not blend into hair,
Looks powdery",0
Absolutely love this holder and the option of suction cups or mounting bracket. Suctions tightly to surface without moving and I am very pleased and would recommend,1
"My new hairdresser recommended this and it has been life changing. She is the only stylist who recognized the natural wave in my hair and this product enhances that. It has made life easier, and I have gotten lots of compliments on my hair since I've been using it. No more perms for me!",1
Awesome product,1
"I am revising this review. I did love this toothbrush, until it stopped working 3 months, and one day after I got it. Amazon did not stand behind this product. I went through the company, and sent it back. Did not get any reply of any kind. I have called them 3 times, no reply. This is not an inexpensive item. Customer service sucks, and I want to let the public know. Stay away from this item. I spent 160.00 to brush my teeth for 3 months. So mad.",0
It wasn't what I was looking for.,0
the shampoo and conditioner do not smell the same and the conditioners texture is like shampoo. the conditioner dryed out my hear and didn't leave it feeling the way it should. I love my biolage products but these products do not seem as if they are from this company..... very un happy and only giving one star due to having to do so.,0
Hair dryer stopped working 3 months after purchase.,0
"Love, love, love! Definatly a must have addition to my collection of Burberry <3 wonderfully long lasting and have recieved so many compliments on it!",1
I found this product to be quite heavy and it weighed down my hair and made it look greasy the day after it was washed.  As a rule I use Mario Badescu skin care products and have found them to be terrific.  The other products I use by the same company are the Bath and Shower Gels which are also very nice.,0
It dries out my skin really bad,0
good quality but a poor design the bite is so shallow it does a worse job that my cheapest disposable razors--if you are thinking about getting an old safety razor design do not go with this one get an adjustable,0
"This is very gentle.  I got some in my eyes and it did not burn at all.  It smells nice.  It's not like most American baby products, but it is soft and sweet and clean, just like I tend to associate with babies.

When sprayed on the hair, it will certainly knock down the bedhead look and it tames fine hair easily.  It does not make hair look dirty or oily, and it definitely freshens it up like it's been washed.  It has been a real blessing to have on hand when dealing with an ear infection.  (Because I didn't want to get ears wet.)

It does contain perfume, so I personally would not use it on tiny infants, but for older babies, and toddlers, it is very nice.  It would also be a great product for adults for plane trips and such to freshen up after long rides with stale air that gets its smell on you since it makes hair smell freshly washed.

The sprayer works fine and it is easy to direct, and it sprays well, but to me, for an expensive product, it is too small of a bottle because it comes out generously with each spray.  A bottle just won't last all that long.",1
"Total disappointment, I had brought this travel size because I travel a lot, I really like Matrix and when I see travel size matrix, I thought it was a good idea to have a confortable easy to refill bottle.
But, when I see the product, I'm very dissapointed;definitely do not worth $12.00 dls. The product is 1.7 oz just 1 time hair wash; the bottle is too small with small mouth, make it hard to refill, it is totally unpractical.
I'm including some picture to reference and compare differents travel size bottle that worth it.",0
"After seeing the infomercials for this line umpteen times, they finally convinced me to try it. Thankfully, I limited my experimentation to one product because I am definitely not impressed. I used about half of the bottle before giving up on it. It did absolutely nothing. In fact, about a week after going back to a similarly priced, lifting and firming product that I've previously used, my husband noticed. My husband of many years noticed an improvement when I stopped using this product! I should have tossed it sooner!

Bottom Line: It's an overpriced and ineffective product. The infomercial worked. The product didn't.",0
"Cord is way too long, but nice item.",1
I really want to know how this got such good reviews.  The actual product was scraped and damaged (but wrapped like it was new).  I honestly thought I was receiving a used product.  I cleaned it off and decided to try it.  It IS NOT SMOOTH WHATSOEVER.  I have thin hair and it got caught and did not run straight through my hair.  I cannot wait to return this.,0
does not work. don't waste your money. Go get your face done professionally,0
Good stuff.  Can EA do no wrong?  Love all the products.,1
"Very nice light rosewater type scent, performs ok  like all the other ones. Not my favorite but a decent value.",1
"Wonderful product, and it smells good too.",1
I used the entire jar to give this product a fair chance. It did nothing. Im not even sure its a good moisturizer...a complete waste of money.,0
I love this stuff makes my skin tighten and youthful,1
Very good moisturizer,1
"My hair hasn't fallen off yet so that's already very good. With that said, this thing gets very very hot. I've burned myself twice and have really bad scars to show for it. I don't recommend this product for people that don't know how to curl their hair or are just starting off (such as myself). I see a lot of professionals using this curler in salons.

The curls are big, bouncy, and shiny and last for a good while! They would probably hold their shape better if I used the proper styling products,  but like I said, I am but a hair curling newbie.

Again, this curling iron gets insanely hot, I use it on the lowest setting usually. Wonderful product but use carefully!",1
I got this yesterday and used it twice so far. It has a runny consistency and smells like mint gum. I have to use more than the recommended pea size since it's runny and I don't feel much if I use alittle. It hasn't made my face feel really dry or tight like everything else I have tried that claims to be non drying. I am hoping that this will help my acne prone/oily skin down the road of continuous use.,1
"I cant tell you how disappointed I am with Abba.  After using their ""Pure Basic Shampoo"" for 20 years they discontinued it and changed the formulas of the whole line.  Supposedly to cleaner ingredients.  Well, Ive tried every single shampoo they currently sell and they all make my scalp itch.  Ive never had that problem before.  I guess the cleaner ingredients are also itchy ingredients.. On top of the itch this gentle shampoo does not clean well.  ABBA BRING BACK YOUR PURE BASIC SHAMPOO! Ive read 100s of other reviews from people asking for the same. As a company owner I couldn't imagine discontinuing a best seller.  Bad decision...",0
"This is a high-end product and worth every penny you pay for it.  I believe there is no other product like this on the market.  It meets all my expectations and beyond.  Most powder foundations make you look older and/or your complexion unnaturally shiny; this doesn't (I am 59 and receive many compliments on my skin; you will find out it also protects your skin from the elements).  A light application will do as a little goes a long way (applying more will only make your skin dull); by the same token, this is not the foundation to cover skin blemishes; it just won't work.  I love this product!  Thank you for bringing it back to the market as I was under the impression we would not see it anymore.",1
"If I could give this a negative star rating, I most certainly would! Dont waste your money. This product doesnt work. I feel as though I purchased snake oil. Its all a lie and the celebrities that promote this product should be ashamed. Crepe Erase absolutely does not work.",0
"Loved it while it worked!  Keeps tripping the cur unit breaker and I
I am scared to use it,  it lasted 3 months shy of. 2 years,  on to find another must have one!",0
"I love this perfume! The reviews don't lie. It really is a lovely, floral sent that isn't overpowering. A lot of perfumes that I've used fade too quickly and don't leave a lasting smell until the end of the day, but this perfume really does a lovely job. It's just strong enough to be able to smell it, but no so strong that you get sick of it or leave a trail letting everybody know somebody with too much perfume just wafted in. I've always enjoyed Calvin Klein perfumes and this one is no exception. Considering how long these last, I think it's definitely worth the price!",1
"Nice product, it does not leave any stickiness or residue on your hair.  Its also does not have parabens which is great!  I have given it four stars because I do not feel it thickens my hair.  What this product does for me is control the hair.",1
"I was excited to try out the big curl look but this curling iron does not work for my. I have waist length hair that is medium/fine thickness i turn it to 400 and it still doesnt curl it. it gets hot but the curls just don't last. am i doing something wrong? id think a ""professonial"" curler would do a better job.",0
"They turned a well priced, decent product and ruined it. Now it's even worse than its competitors. It comes out thick and chunky, with no semblance of a natural look.",0
Nice product. Very good for curly grey hair. Gives a nice sheen and is effective in taming the frizzies.,1
"Too expensive for the small amount.  I like the smell, but one pump barely cleans my body.  I'm going to buy the turbo wash from now on.",0
"I was so disappointed in this product. From what I saw on the Dermadoctor website, it gave me hope and it has such a cute package, plus I felt like this doctor knows what she's talking about. But I used it religiously, the whole tube, and it did absolutely nothing for my KP. I felt like a loser for spending all this money on something called KP Duty that didn't work at all. I think my bumps looked a bit worse, actually, to add insult to injury. Learn from my mistake, and if you have KP, keep looking (I'm still looking for something that works!)",0
This is some of the best makeup setting spray I've ever used.,1
Leaves hair clean without drying.,1
"Does exactly what it says. The minute you put it on, it gives you a kick of freshness. Once applied on face, it keeps it soft and moistened. I am happy with the same.",1
Tiny tube for the money. Thought it was a larager tube.,0
I bought Coney Island Cotton Candy. A perfect daily nude daily color if you want a natural simple nail look. 5 stars. It's better to look te buyer pictures before choosing your color. It's really helpful!,1
Thanks. It's good item but not perfect.,1
"Received this as a trial from one of my Ipsy bags a few months back and initially loved it so looked into buying a ""full size"" version. It does the job better than other ""grocery store"" brand dry shampoos, the smell is pleasant (but I've heard of others that complain about it). The nozzle DOES clog quite easily so it needs to be wiped often or it will not spray out nicely. It does spray quite a bit of powder onto your hair as compared to other dry shampoos, so don't be over generous. A little goes a long way.

The one I ordered ran out completely after two to three uses, whereas my ""trial"" version still had several uses left (and I'd been using it for awhile). Chalked it up to a faulty product, maybe there was something wrong with the nozzle, I don't know.

I think though for the price paid I expected a little more. For now, I'll be sticking with the ""grocery store"" brands, as while yes, I have to use more of the product to get my desired effect, it is significantly cheaper and seems to last longer.",1
Works really good!  Started fading my age spot on my hand.  I would highly recommend this.  Tried many more before this one that don't work.,1
"Lorac is my go-to powder. Generally I prefer Jane Iredale, but their prices do not jive with my budget all the time. Lorac is a great no. 2! Usually I purchase their lightest powder, however in the summer I tan a little, so I purchased PF2. It was a little darker than I was expected, but blends in well with my bronzer and the tan on the rest of my body. Thanks!",1
"Have been using this product for several years & really like it. However, the product I received for this particular order was definite sub-standard in terms of quality. It was very obviously OLD product as it was discolored & partially dried up...very disappointing. Would NOT recommend buying this product from this site!!",0
This is how my product arrived! Very disapppinted!,0
wife likes it  hard to find,1
"I have fine, straight, chemically treated hair and the keratin treatment makes my hair incredibly soft and shiny. I would use this every day, but too much of a good thing can make hair brittle. I use this twice a week and have great results every time. The smell is so nice. I recommended this to my friends, too.",1
I purchased this powder to use with my M.A.C. foundation. I use at as a finishing powder. It works perfectly! It blends easily and does not cake on my face. I just buff it all over and it give me that air brushed look... simply beautiful. It's a bonus that this comes in different shades. This jar is sure to last 6 months or more. Great value!,1
I've gotten this as a present. I tried all the colors. A lot of them are flaky and it doesn't transfer well enough for me. My NYC shadows are like 100% better and they're about 1-3 dollars at the drug store.,0
Lovely protection.  It i a little heavy for me.,1
"SMELLS FAKE. WASTED MY MONEY, ENDED UP GIVING IT AWAY",0
Love it!!,1
"Something is wrong with this product. I purchased it in October. For me, one bottle lasts 3-4 months. I've used a pea sized amount and just ran out, after less than a month of use. Another customer posted they think it is counterfit. I have to agree.",0
"this was a reorder if you have very chapped lips this is a good nourishing mask for them. i wear it at night and in the am my lips are soft.  however, if you are outside and it's very cold it will turn white since it solidifies if you have a thick amount on.",1
"I bought this as a result of very high recommendation from either Prevention or More magazine.  Not at all impressed. First, you need to use a brush to apply not your finger.  It's also quite thick. I would not purchase again especially it's more than 2x the price of my long standing product, L'Oreal True Match concealer.",0
"I really like this product. As a tinted moisturizer, it is not a heavy foundation. And somehow the color works for everyone. I'd recommend you give it a try; it's not too heavy and not too light and it goes on very smoothly.",1
"This is a weird product. It really coats your eyelashes, and when you remove it, it comes off in long black pieces that coated your lashed. It did have great coverage. But it made my lashes feel really hard, not natural, it made me loose eye lashes as I removed it, and it made my lashes feel dry.",0
"I bought this item from a different web page. I have been using it for some time now, a little over a year. This slows down hair growth but does NOT permanently removes the hair. I still use it because it SLOWS down hair growth. :/",0
Finally ACNE skin care that is safe during pregnancy! I love this toner! Especially the scent... like fresh pumpkin pie!,1
"If you want to keep your lashes, don't buy this product. I couldn't get this ""tar"" off with eye makeup remover!",0
"This is a nice rejuvenation lotion.  I'm not committed to using it twice a day for a couple, few months (as the material references), so I do not know that I am a credible voice on whether you will see sustained results.  And the pump for my bottle had no straw, so I do not know that I can properly opine on how much lotion ""two pumps"" will dispense.  What I can tell you is that it does not take much of this lotion to cover my face -- a little goes a long way.  And neither my hands nor my face feels greasy or slimy after I've applied the lotion, which is maybe what I like most about this product.  My dry skin feels rehydrated and more elastic after use, which is great relief in the winter dryness.",1
Still learning how to use it.  The instructions were not very clear.  It was a little streaky and I haven't used it for a few days and I still have a few spots.,1
These are terrible. They don't work at all. I noticed no difference using them for a week. I also had a difficult time taking them off the sheet and would fold them on themselves. Very disappointing.,0
No no no ..Stop don't buy don't don't don't,0
too watery seems as not original product.,0
"This is my favorite lotion/shampoo/body wash set to use on my children and to give away in baby shower gifts. To me personally the smell is heavenly and when you slather your little one up well with this lotion, it really does hydrate their skin nicely.",1
"Moisturizes very well, but does not stay very long. Product is listed as 0.3 oz, but I received 0.2 oz which is the only reason for a lower rating.",0
My husband loves this.  I bought it as a Christmas present and it came with the cologne as well as a travel size cologne.  Husband smells amazing. :-),1
Doesn't take off all of my makeup. Wipes were better.,0
Do not like it.  Plan on giving it away.  Do not like the return policy.,0
"Really bad deodorant, I used the vichy from europe, i couldn't find the same one here in the US but i thought other type of vichy deodorant should be good enough. Actually makes u sweat more, the deodorant becomes very liquidy after you put it. It is definitely one of the worst ive used.",0
Active ingriedents are several sun blocking creams...I couldn't find anything related to retinol..and it is do greazy...I felt like I spent almost 100 bucks for sun block cream....,0
"I have a Babyliss hair dryer and flat iron that I love.  There's no love for this curling iron.  A couple of other reviews mentioned how the clip doesn't grip the hair well enough.  I found that to be the case for me.  My hair is straight and fine, but there's a lot of it.

The first time I tried the iron, I set the heat to a little over medium.  It didn't curl my hair at all.  Keep in mind that my Babyliss flat iron will curl my hair, so I fully expected this to do the same.  When I cranked up the heat a bit, I had the same results...no curl.  I tried to vary the amount of hair I curled at a time with no change.

My last ditch effort was to turn it all the way up to 450 degrees.  It not only did it not curl my hair, but some of it was burned.  I smelled burned hair until my next wash.

Yesterday I sent it back for a refund minus the shipping cost.

Perhaps this would work better for a person with thicker hair, but I would caution the person with straight, fine hair like mine.  I'm disappointed with this product for the amount I paid.  My cheap Conair curling iron that I bought for $10 years ago curls my hair much better than this.",0
"This has the exact same scent and consistency as a QVC brand. Had the same results too, not good ones. I have been using self tanners for years. Now and then I will try one a friend might mention they like. I should stick with the one that works for me. Like the QVC version, this one had streaks, some orange to it, and mostly washed off in the shower. I use Hempz self tanner, and matches my natural tan perfectly. No orange, no Streaks no wash off.",0
To dry. Very hard to apply because the liner was very dry.,0
"Bought for Christmas present and by the first of January, the control for the temperature will no longer turn the temperature down.",0
Smells horrible is is definitely not authentic,0
The WORST quality--my nail color chips 3 times as fast with this coat. UGH.,0
"Very disappointed in this set. I returned once because the base was not working. The box looked as if someone had already returned them, so I thought the second base would be better. Same thing, looked like the box had been returned and the product did not work properly. I am returning them for something that will work.",0
"Didn't like the color very much .
Goes on feeling thin.",0
"I have to say I am really quite impressed.  I have used many chemical peel products in my time including prescription Retina A as a teenager.  I have also used various strengths of Glycolic Acid ranging from 5% to prescription strength 30%.  This amount of 10% is ""just right""--just enough to make you peel, but not so much that it leaves you red and flaky.

I am an ingredients nut and I for the most part like to know what I am putting on my face.  I saw an ingredient Myristyl Nicotinate and looked it up.  Apparently this ingredient helps protect skin from skin cancer.  That is very thoughtful of them!  That is not to say that there are not any chemicals in this product, but there are some natural ones as well including Aloe Leaf Juice, Myritilus Fruit Extract, Willow Bark Extract, Sugar Cane, Orange Fruit Extract, Lemon Fruit Extract, and Sugar Maple Extract.

The process is quick and easy and the product does not have any scent for those who are sensitive to fragrances.  It is a 2 step system: 1) Apply the detoxifying mask and leave on for 1 minute, then 2) Apply a thin layer of the Activator (Glycolic Acid) and leave on for 3-5 minutes (I went for the full 5 minutes).  Then, wash it off with a damp washcloth.  That's it!

The instructions say to use it once a week, and I really would not use it more than that.  From the first moment of application you feel it ""tingling"".  Then after you wash it off, you can feel it working.  Day 2 my skin felt sensitive but no peel yet.  By day 3 I was able to slough off a think layer of dead skin cells with a loofah in the shower.  Unlike Retina A, you do not continue to flake and peel during the day.  Afterwards I did see a significant difference in my skin.  It felt more taught and the fine lines were diminished.  This one for me is a home run!",1
"I was very disappointed with this product. I had read such great reviews on other sites and was expecting much more. It comes out light, but made my hair very sticky and stiff at the roots. I was looking for something to really to some volume in my fine limp hair and all it did was make it feel like I hadn't washed my hair in days. No volume at all. Store products work better. It also coated my hair with something that made it very difficult to get it dry at the roots. Took twice as long to dry around my crown and part.  Would not recommend. It does smell great though!",0
Lovin it guys! Great service! Thank you!,1
"A friend recommended Blinc,  I didn't like the feeling and it does not stay on...but rather clumps up.  Really over priced and a waste of money.",0
This did Nothing to cover my dark circles. I can't believe I wasted so much money on this.,0
"It's hard to write a review on a non-performing product. I smeared the cream in the contours of my eyes and onto my lips. I waited. I did the same thing in the evening. I waited. Next day, same thing. I waited. Nothing. No difference.",0
Works wonderfully,1
"This product is all about learning how to use it.
When I first go this, I was soooo excited about it. I mean, a mascara that promises not to smudge? Who wouldn't be excited? And with my super oily eyelids, I have struggled with mascaras many times before.

Then I got the mascara.

At first, it was awful. I mean BAD. It was clumpy and just seemed to wet my lashes. But then I learned how to apply, and it was like a dream.

You have to apply the mascara without twisting the brush at all and only applying a thin coat. Then, I go to the other eye and do the same, and then do another coat on both sets of lashes. Now, it makes my lashes look awesome and I no longer have smudges under my eyes and marks on my upper eyelids. Yay!

And it really is easy to get off, you just have to wet your face and tug gently on the lashes to make the tubes slide right off. It might take a little while to get the tube off, but it was worth it.",1
The first time I used this shampoo i could see a big difference in my hair.  My hair is already softer & shinnier,1
Haven't seen any improvement in pigment spots.  Although I have read that any type of corrector that isn't prescription grade takes a long long time to actually make a difference.  I wouldn't buy this again.  Keep my money & save up for the real stuff.,0
I highly recommend this product to all whom has oily skin,1
"I have been using this product for over a year and I love it! My dark hair is thinning on top caused me to get so self conscious...now I get approached by work peers asking what Ihave done to get this think full hair. If you have a thinning issue give this a chance, it will change your world. Check out the youtube videos, this products does what it says it will do!",1
"I love this face wash! Before this beauty, I was breaking out all of the time! I couldn't find a gentle face wash that really cleaned my pores! This stuff does the job but doesn't dry out your skin!",1
smell good every day,1
The package  arrived very quickly and was exactly as promised!,1
My absolute Go-To Bronzer. A little goes a long way. It doesn't cause a break out. I will never go without it!,1
"I have been a person struggling with acne the past three years and I thought maybe I wasn't thoroughly washing my face well enough, so I thought a scrubbing brush would be able to go deeper inside and get the impurities out. I've used this product for about two weeks, and I absolutely no difference in complexion or tone. I still have the blackheads on my nose. This product really costs a whole lot for something that doesn't really do what it says it will do. I gave it two stars simply because I'm sure it cleans, it just doesn't clean any better than your hands would.",0
"Calvin Klein's Eternity Now cologne has a pleasant scent, comes in a substantial bottle, and lasts a long time.

The Eternity Now is boxed in a simple cardboard box with a reinforced liner to protect the glass bottle.  The bottle itself is a chunky piece of glass with a simple and masculine design.  The whole presentation is very elegant and refined.

Eternity Now's fragrance is subtle and pleasant.  It has an earthly and slightly sweet scent.  It's not overly masculine, or smelling like a ""lumberjack's shed"", but it doesn't need to be.  It perfect for most occasions.

It has great staying power too.  I sprayed one spritz on myself, and it was still noticeable 6 hours later.  A little goes a long way.

I had no issues with rashes, itching, or skin irritation of any kind.

All in all... a wonderful cologne.",1
I was trying to return this. But don't have the information. From the minute I got it it's been shocking me. No results after a 3 months.,0
"Knock off for sure!  The last bottle I bought of this from Amazon could not have been the real thing. It was thick, didn't detangle my hair, and left a greasy residue. My stylist had warned me this can happen when not buying from a salon or directly from the manufacturer. I didn't believe her. Now I do. Won't be buying this from anywhere other than a salon from now on!",0
It's not what my wife spected!!,0
"THIS IS A HOT MESS!  I purchased 4 bottles in various colors.  ROCK ROYALTY, BLACK & GREEN COLORS ARE HORRIBLE WATERY AND TOO LIGHT -UNLIKE THE PHOTOS. THE light pink is ok. I contacted the seller to return the unopened bottles that were still sealed in boxes; the vendor WILL NOT accept returns because it is considered a ""personal"" item.  Do not make the same mistake that I did.  I still  have two UNOPENED bottles of this expensive garbage left.  TRASH.",0
super great!,1
Outstanding product at the price. I would like to recommend my friends and dad.,1
"I was expecting this polish to stay on for at least a week with no chips especially for how much it costs.  I gave it two stars because I love the color, but I've tried it twice now and it chipped the first or second day both times.  Disappointing.",0
"Great curling iron, when it works. I've had this curling iron for lesson six months and it's just stopped working. The light is on, but it won't heat up. In order to get a replacement, you have to pay for shipping and then it takes another month to get out to you. Very frustrating. The return is not worth the hassle.",0
Smells good. Gives hair body.,1
I love my hair dryer and would not trade it for any off the shelf blow dryer! Takes less time. My hair is not frizzy and it is light weight. My cord never gets kinks ...it is the best!!! Get some Byliss!!!,1
"Amazing. Seriously. I couldn't make my hair flat if I tried. I have a chin length french bob and holy cooooow this product is a game changer. I'm currently using the well being shampoo and the naturotech intense conditioner with this spray. Voila! I use about 5-7 pumps mainly o the ends and middle, not focusing too much on the roots. Comb through, style with a roll brush. You will not regret buying this product.",1
It chips easily and is too expensive! A poor choice.,0
"I'm 28 years old and this is the first time I have owned (or even tried) using a curling iron. The iron looked a bit dirty when it arrived? Oh well.  I still haven't mastered it, but I'm getting there.  It's a good first curling iron, I think.  I've used it about 5 times and I've only slightly burned myself once! **applause**",1
You can look on the official Stila website and see that the black liquid liner has gold writing.... the thing that makes me think this is a fake is how crumbly it is. I'm honestly about to give this to my little sister and buy the real deal from Sephora or Ulta.... I suggest you do the same if you really want this eye liner.,0
Good,1
"One tube was fine I use this all the time and love the product it works amazing. However, one of the tubes is very liquid and watery. I just opened it today and the return/exchange window closed today. Love the product not happy with one that is watery and I have seen this problem in other reviews",0
"I have been using the Proraso shave cream with great success.  I purchased this ""Soap in the Bowl"" to support a recent vacation as I did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl.  This product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube, I did not experience any break-outs as a result.  This is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates.",1
Im glad I was able to try them all out but they are much weaker than the regular ones.,1
"The shampoo is fantastic.  The conditioner doesn't really soften my hair.  I started to use Kerasilk with this shampoo counterpart.  It gets rid of the brassiness and the Kerasilk makes my hair soft.

Not the best purology conditioner.  The hydrating is WAY WAY better.",0
"This works well enough.  It's not exceptional, but it is good.

I don't think, however, that it is clearly better than less expensive makeup remover/cleansers.  So, given that it is quite pricy, I don't see this becoming a staple.",1
Best eyeliner hands down!,1
This is THE best moisturizer ever. Doesn't leave your skin shiny but does leave it smooth.,1
"The packaging alone makes a beautiful gift. The scent in manly with hints a spice (I smelled cloves and cinnamon) and it is long-lasting. A little spritz goes a long way. I took off a star because the scent of cloves is not one of my favorites - reminds me of either the dentist (my grandfather, a dentist, used oil of cloves to treat gum problems, etc. or a holiday ham).

The bottle is a cobalt blue square with white accents - very blue white and red. Lacoste has always beeen associated with sports and the scent is sporty and fresh.",1
Works exactly like it should.  4 stars because of me not quite understanding how to work a single blade and get the nooks and creases of my face. Other than that this is great,1
I purchased the alloy color and found it did not go on as described.  I did not go on easily.  Perhaps it was the color.,0
"I am a long time- 40 years+ hot roller girl. I use them several mornigs each week. I urchased this set from another vendor in April 1 2013.  I do not think it is worth the high price tag. I wish I'd returned it before the return period expired but now I am stuck and I do use it. It does curl my hair. I have medium length very fine hair that needs help acheiving body so hence the love of hot rollers. I find it a pain to have to heat the rollers one at a time. Not enough rollers come with this starter set so I really need to spend even more money on four more. These also get tangled in my hair very easily. They don't get  very hot, I wish they were a little hotter. I don't think the heated clips add anything to the performance. Results are he same  with the heat as with out  There are so many sets out there that heat up all the rollers very quickly. Since I spent so much, it will be a long time before I will allow myself to replace this with another set I have on my Wish List. I would not recommend or buy again. I notice QVC no longer has this for sale.",0
"In general, this product does work better than other products I use and the smell doesn't bother me.  However, it takes a lot for my very oily hair..and after a couple of applications, it is somewhat ""gooey"" or ""hair sticks together"".  Yes, I should  wash my hair more but I have been ill..and it's difficult to wash it more than once/week.  So, this expensive product doesn't last for more than a few months, maybe 3-4 months, as I have to use it w/in a day or so of washing my hair. Also, even though I have hypothyroidism with hair loss--I've noticed that hair loss has increased since I started using this in Jan., 2013.  I think I will just get some cornstarch (since this product is mainly cornstarch anyway) and hope this works as well (or better), is safer..and certainly less expensive.",0
"I love the mascara, but the primer did not work for me. It gave me raccoon eyes shortly after application.",0
"I  had laser done on my whole body and paid $2500. Unfortunately lasser does not take 6-8 sessions as these spa tell you in their selling speech.
I had remove 60% of my hair, and each additional session in the laser spa if i was lucky enough to get an appointment cost over $120. So, after reading some reviews I decided to give it a try. I am very happy. I have to admit that If I would still have all my hair, it would be take quite a while, but i can't complain. It is great for touch ups. I can see the rest of my hair falling.
I recommend this product.",1
This product will not work if you have a lot of her loss. However if your hair is just thinning a little I would definitely recommend it.,1
no use at all,0
This cream really stings.,0
"Great for dry hands just haven't had time to research how you clean them, if you clean them or do you rotate pairs of the gloves and then toss.  A tad expensive.",1
"3 stars for price, it is a bit expensive compared tonother products and thats the only negative.
5 stars for styling.",1
"I love Henckels quality. I grew up with a set of Henckels knives. When offered the three-piece grooming set for review, I jumped on it.

The set contains clippers that fold flat, tweezers and a sapphire file, all in a neat red leather case. Great for travel and daily outings where a little help might be needed.

That said, I found the clippers a little hard to figure out. Once I got them open and set up, I had more difficulty closing them flat again, however, Im sure Ill get this worked out in time. I am a bit hesitant to give this set the five-star rating Id like because of the clippers and the fact that they seem a bit light for thick fingernails. The quality, otherwise, is superb, so Im settling for four and one half stars.",1
It made my hair Very hard and my hair did come out crunchy. Not a fan of blowpro products. Won't buy again.,0
"Tried this recently at Macy's. It had great smell for a small amount sprayed. The one bought from amazon is very diluted so you can hardly smell the fragrance, even if you spray a lot of it on. Amazon delivered the item as expected and on time but I  too was disappointed with the product. I suggest you buy this  item off the shelf at a department store such as Macy's, JC Penney, etc.",0
"I wanted this to make a difference but it just didn't. Well made, looks great, just neither of us have noticed and difference to our skin or hair. For the price it's a disappointment and waste of money.",0
"Omghs guys this make up is sooo beautiful I was so excited to see in person , and when I got it I was like wowwww .
This pallete is def so pigmented and so nice west for the makeup look u are looking for .
I want l make more and more look with this .
I can do a lot of different look with this small cute pallete .
It was littler disappointed cuz it came broke . It was just a little on the purple , it's not a big deal . I m not the kid of girl that make a storm deal in a cup of water,  It's not anyone fault , I believe it accident happen and all u can do its just fix it .
This is a amamzing product and I would never give bad star .
I know they work hard on this product and  the last thing I want to do is give them a bad review .
So I love it this Em michelle Phan makeup palette.
I will def by more and more of this .
It's a great product and I want all the colors for sure . ",1
I notice less hair loss using the Bosley shampoo and conditioner. I will buy it again. My hair is somewhat limp with its use,1
I love this micellar water! It removes makeup and gently cleanses skin without over-stripping. Way better than US drugstore versions in my personal opinion. So glad I can order it here :),1
I never write a review on anything but this product is worth it. At around 3 weeks old my son developed extreme baby acne. Although I know it didn't hurt him it was painful for me to look his little face like that. I did some research and found this product. Ive been using it for two days now along with a moisturizing lotion and my sons face has cleared up tremendously! I recommend this to any mommy out there willing to try another solution. Definitely worth it,1
IT SETTLES INTO FINE LINES...NOT HAPPY AT ALL FOR A FULL COVERAGE FOUNDATION !!,0
Do not buy this  I was looking around for the curler and it looked like a good deal so I bought it and I was curling my hair and it burn right off,0
"Japonesque has been known for being a highly under-rated brush brand.  I found the Kumadori blending brush to be very pleasantly soft.  The high density of the hairs makes the brush feel quite plush and inviting.  I like to use this brush after applying liquid foundation and bronzer (or blush) -- by sweeping it across the cheeks it helps to even out and make the full makeup application look more balanced.  The only negative discovered while using the Kumadori blender is a couple of hairs have fallen out.  I've experienced this when using higher end brushes as well, so it's a minor flaw for a good quality blending brush.",1
I love oribe products! I recently ordered this to try and found that it works great for volumizing  my hair. Definitely use it on damp hair and blow dry. I love the smell too!,1
This was bought as a gift for my daughter who kept asking me to buy her another flat iron.  But I didn't want to just buy any kind.  This is amazing.  I use it as well. It's quality and brand new.  I have no problems buying from this seller.  Thanks.,1
"What a beautiful, natural glow this gives.  It is, as other have stated, highly pigmented so a little goes a long way, but I love this.  It's my new go to color.  I'm quite fair but I have no doubt it would look just as good on darker skin...maybe be a little more heavy handed with it.",1
"MY FAVORITE EYELINER EVER! This had been recommended to me on my FB mom's group, the best non smudgeable eyeliner I have ever used...WORTH EVERY PENNY!",1
Love this product and have used it for a while. Just bought a replacement and received it today. The container leaked and I lost a ton of the product during shipping...,0
Definitely noticed a difference,1
very efficient against acne,1
always use this,1
"NICE PRODUCT, NO IRRITATING SMELL, NOT QUITE AS MATTE AS I WOULD HAVE LIKED, BUT DOES COVER REALLY WELL.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY.",1
Blotchy and fake looking,0
Smooths hair. Calms frizz.,1
"nice product, little goes long way",1
The lotion felt good and appeared to moisturize well but it has a very strong odor overall.  Did not set well with me so unfortunately I won't be using,0
"Really disappointed with this hairbrush. I usually brush my hair as I'm blow drying it, and nowhere did I see it mentioned that the brush shouldn't be used with a hairdryer. The first time I used it with my dryer though the bristles bent and warped, making the brush pretty much useless. I've never had a hairbrush do this after years of use with a hairdryer, let alone once.",0
Wish I never spent the money.  Doesn't work with any ease at all.  I find myself just masssaging in the FatGirlSlim lotion vigorously to stimulte my legs.,0
Works well:),1
"I swear by Jurlique and have been a devotee since 2000. So, last winter, when my face became very dry due to an extreme weather change, I purchased this cream and their rosewater balancing mist to help remedy the situation. Needless to say, Jurlique came to my rescue and I still use this cream as part of my evening skin regimen. However, since this cream is thick I doubt I'll be using it during the warmer months.

Last thing. This cream, as some have mentioned, does have a scent but I don't find it distracting. I actually like it because it's a ""reminder"" of the cream's floral ingredients.

I gave this product 4 stars because of the fact that I can't use it all year round. Otherwise, this product is 5-star worthy.",1
made my skin break out,0
My wife loves this curling iron. No bad smells and very easy/comfortable to use.,1
"Didn't last but one week. The heating element went out.  Yes, I was refunded, but that many bad reviews should have told me something.",0
Use it all the time.,1
Used the product but saw no visible difference in wrinkles on side of face around eyes etc. not worth the $$,0
"Such a good highlighter! Especially for a softer, daily highlight.",1
"Not a real BaByliss, stopped heating up after a few months of use. Recommend purchasing full price from the brand itself!",0
"It's a solid consistency - does a good job of conditioning my skin and keeping my beard in check. The smell is mediocre, but dissipates relatively quickly. I'm happy I got it, but will try another product next.",1
"I love this cleanser, but it is very expensive purchased from my aesthetician.. I was very skeptical to order online as image claims not to sell to any online retailer. I'm not sure how the seller gets their product, but as far as I can tell it appears to be the real thing.",1
My hair falls like crazy after this. I was having a fair amount before using it and now anywhere that i sit or go i find my hair is falling over there. I was using this regularly 3 days a week. Do yourself a favour and don't buy this. Safe your money. Shipping this to return tomorrow.,0
"i purchased several irons to sell in my salon, this iron was purchased from my client and never heated and light wouldn't come on.... the return policy sucks because its never been used brand new and unworking  never buy from this seller! gonna take it to twitter.",0
"I absolutely love Bio Ionic tools, especially their hairdryer and brushes.  The hairdryer is light and quiet, a must for me.  However, it broke after less than a year.  I mentioned it to them on Instagram, and was instructed to email purchase info.  I did but haven't heard from them since.",0
It does not fir the dryer it was MEANT to go with!! I had to duct tape it to my dryer in order to able to use it.,0
This product was useless.,0
Used this product for couple of days and I had a allergic reaction. My entire face itches and I had tiny bumps all over. Wouldn't recommend to people who have sensitive skin.,0
"After two days in Maui I switched to a different sunblock.  This goes on decent tho very shiny but when I got warm in would melt and settle into every crease.  I switched to a much cheaper brand.

If you decide to buy this product I found it significantly cheaper at Drugstore.com.",0
wouldn't stay powered on,0
"It feel great and has a matte finish on the skin, though it doesn't cover blemishes at all. My skin has lightened since I've started using it a month ago, so I believe the SPF 50 rating is true.",1
Too dry for me,0
Stinging and redness when applied.  Did not notice any significant improvements.,0
Curls my hair but they fall out in 10 minutes.  Used it a handful of times and it broke.,0
"If you are one of those very fortunate women who can go a week without washing, maybe this product is for you. I see it as being a light touchup for that last day or two. If you have oily scalp that requires more washing, this will do nothing for you! If you just use a little bit, it does nothing. If you do more than one light pass over your roots thinking it will help, it makes it worse. Your scalp will feel so gunky and itchy, youll want to just jump in the shower and wash your hair anyway. If Im stepping out briefly in the morning the day after I wash my hair (and Im not planning on being out all day) Ill use it just to freshen up slightly and give my hair some scent. But I only do that to use up the rest of this product. My hair feels cleaner at the end of day two without using this product!",0
"My eyes tend to be most sensitive during the fall and spring allergy seasons however I can appreciate a gentle eyeliner year round. I got this eyeliner in brown, it doesnt standout on my brown eyes but is just perfect for a natural look. It was a nice soft application, no tugging or stuttering on the lid. It does last best when my lids are primed, but I also got a bit more lasting time by going over the line lightly with a similar color shadow although that does soften the line. Overall I'm pretty happy with this liner, it is gentle, goes on easy and lasts well.",1
"I have been adviced to use this shampoo as i have dandruff, by a beautician in parlour.
After using this my scalp itches like hell, and the hairfall is to the peaks.
I wonder how it is working so well on others, may be it has not suited my scalp.
I have switched back to head and shoulders.",0
"This curlers are great and work good. I don't use them near as much as I thought I would, requires more time than I wish to donate.",1
"I tried this new formula cleanser and absolutely hate it. It made my hair flat and extremely hard to manage...an amazing amount of static. Is this formula change because P&G bought out the company? Anyway, I am running around the internet hoarding bottles of the original, wonderful, made in the USA, gold cap version that I've used for years. Don't know what I'll do when I run out of that!?!",0
Bought this for my husband and he loves the feeling and the smell is nice too. not too strong. I got it for christmas so the shipping was great and supper fast. Got it in time for chirstmas!!!,1
Too strong of a smell for me.  I thought it would have a lighter scent. I mix it with unscented lotion to mellow the smell.,0
"Right when I got these, my Clarisonic stopped working. Just died. Won't charge, will not work. I was excited about my new brush heads and they come lovely in a pretty pack...but I can't use them! I'm heartbroken. I will have to give them away or something. I've only had my Clarisonic sine Christmas, so I'm really peeved about it. I don't think I'll buy another Clarisonic because of this. I know this isn't about the brush heads, but I guess the Clarisonic brand in general. But, again, it's a pretty pack and will make a good gift if I knew someone with a Clarisonic spin brush.",1
"It fits all of my equipment perfectly, but I don't like the zipper part, doesn't go from one end of the bag to the other end completely, leaving gaping holes where my stuff can fall out from the inside even when zipped up.",1
I received a different bottle than pictured. It has different ingredients also when I compared it with my ABBA pure moisture I got from the salon :-( sad,0
"Great price for a Professional Salon quality flat iron. I have a BaByliss 1 1/2"" flat iron from 8 years ago that still works great, but wanted a 1"" for the shorter layers closer to my face. This flat iron heats up quickly and works great on my thick, course hair. I'm so glad I bought this one and not a CHI. Buy it! You won't be disappointed.",1
"Hello, I have already had 6 laser hair removal treatments with my doctor. the 6 treatments for full body cost me $2000 (full legs and arms, Brazilian, full face, under arms, and happy trail). I bought this product for touch ups since I have a little bit of hair left.
The lamp cartridge ran out from 1st time I was using this product. I only did one arm and one leg. the device stopped as soon as I started doing my 2nd leg.
You will keep wasting your money buying these lamp cartridge and you will not get the results that you want because this device's power is less than half the device the doctor uses.
I though I would be saving some money by buying this product and at the end I will have the system at my house for anytime I need it later in the future. I called my doctor and asked if I can do an extra 2 treatments for Brazilian, full arms and legs, and the upper lip. the doctor gave me a discount and  she will charge me $320 for these extra treatments, which is a different of $20 since I bought this product for $300.
I was very hairy when I started my treatments and now I do not even shave even though there is some hair left, but with these 2 extra treatments, I am sure I will not have any hair left :)
BE CAREFUL and do not waste your money on this product.
oh by the way, I do not have sensitive skin and never had redness from my treatments with the doctor. This product made my skip very red for around 4 hours.",0
Arrived leaking & I was never able to open.,0
Smells amazing and gives the hair some texture without becoming gunky!,1
I tired to return it but was told I couldn't for some reason or other :(  It said it was one thing and it was something all together different :(,0
"Best product ever. No flaking, getting gummy, stiffness, etc.  I love the smell. And..the volumizer actually works!",1
"I decided to go with matte nail envy on accident. The woman who helped me in a nail store thought this was a matte nail polish top coat, and I was disappointed (at first) when it was not. Later my nails started to crack on the sides (too much buffing and nail polish) and I had to do patch work with super glue and tea bag paper (which is excellent to keep from having to cut your nails of if they start to tear). What's great about this is that when you do a patchwork on your nail you usually have to apply a top coat over it to make it invisible, but since nail polish was getting me into trouble with damaged nails in the first place I decided to give this a shot - and it did the exact same thing, made the patchwork invisible! Yay!

The reason for -1 star is because it's supposed to be Matte but it's never really matte unless you stop at 1 coat, which you're not supposed to per the instructions. If you put cuticle oil and lotion on your hands it turns the matte shiny. Not natural nail shiny, but almost a top-coat shiny. This may be what some people want but it's supposed to be matte so I'm knocking off one star for that.",1
Does not dry out my skin and works well to take my zits away fairly quickly.,1
"This smells amazing, leaves my face feeling soft.",1
"I love this stuff, but I'm not sure it actually plumps my lips. But it feels good, never sticky, no weird smell. I'll keep ordering it.",1
"You def. need the right brush for this product. I suggest Sephora for such a purchase. However, when this item is on it is staying on, it does not smudge when it is dried, even if you sweat....Overall, great purchase and worth the money spent.",1
"Too expensive for what you get. I needed to use this daily for my KP, and it lasted about a week.
Switched to Curel which works better at a fraction of the price.",0
i did not like it at all. i did not notice or feel any improvements on my skin.,0
"Quick delivery, fair price, the reason for the two stars is the scent is very weak like the cologne is old.",0
"I've had this product for a couple weeks now. I've heard it was ""lightning in a bottle"". I was recommended it for lines around the eyes.
I've been using it twice a day. I don't see any results yet, and I'm just not sure about it. I will keep using it for a while.  But for the price, I'd rather feel a little assured about it and I don't, not yet.",0
"I was disappointed in the smell.  Nothing to write home about sadly.  It should be.  I know this was aimed at males, but trust me, I was hoping for an aroma like no other.....minus one.  The shampoo/conditioning soap functions as you would expect.  Though disappointing in that my hair doesn't shine.  No compliments yet in how my hair looked healthy or smelled wonderfully.  Minus two.  I will go back to awapuhi or the wonderfully aromatic banana smelling Nexxus that I never tire of inhaling while I use it.......Mitch could add a fruit of some kind type of smell, or masculine deoderant type of smell.  Anything is better than none at all.  Not impressed in any way.  Sorry, just being honest.

**I find myself shopping for new hair products while this is still 3/4 full.  I don't want to shower because I won't smell good....its hair stripper, no conditioner in there.......leaves your hair feeling lame and helpless.  Smelling like you are like all the other guys that don't pamper themselves.  My girlfriend stopped showering here......lol.  I hate this shampoo and conditioner in one.  Tell Mitch to go back to the drawing board......mitch, how male oriented......like we wouldn't buy it if it said paul mitchell.......marketing people grow up.  Anyway, I will prob let my room mate use it to wash his dogs.....",0
"I chose this for my nails in my favorite nail salon.  I  liked it so much on my fingers and toes that I bought my own bottle.  I don't usually like bright red, but this has a gold tone to it--but no glitter--that I love.  It may be the only bottle of polish I've ever had that I finish.",1
"Mild, clean scent that goes on clear. I don't agree with the other reviews, although I also preferred the previous formulation.",1
Gives the hair a bright clean look.,1
"I have been using this product for 6 weeks and see absolutely no difference
to my under eye area. Nice lotion consistancy, but not anywhere close to
being worth the money.",0
not sure if product is doing anything :-(,0
"I have struggled with moderate acne since I was a teenager, and even now in my 30s I still struggle with it. I am always on the lookout for products that can help control it. For the last six months, I've been using these toner pads, and I just have to say that I am incredibly pleased with them. My skin has never been so balanced and clear. I used to have a really pronounced oily T-zone, contrasted against dry cheeks, but with consistent use of this product, my oily T-zone and dry cheeks have both moved toward the balanced middle of the spectrum. My acne is also under control. I still have sporadic breakouts, but nothing like I used to experience. I purchase these faithfully every 30 days. Love this product!",1
"Sadly, was disappointed with this OPI product.  The lacquer did not go on smoothly, and even after two coats, was streaky.  I have always loved the regular line, so hope this was a glitch.",0
Very dissatisfied! The heating element stopped working after using it 3 times and was unable to purchase another one for the same price.,0
Beautiful color especially if you top it with Lobster roll. Makes a great summer orangey red color!,1
Love this stuff. Mmmmmm,1
Omg my bottle arrived half empty! The bottle wasn't properly sealed!,0
"This produce may be applied in just moments to achieve a very efficient results, any time of the day.",1
"I got this as a gift from my husband last December, so far I have not notice any difference and its March already. I will be waiting for couple more months to really see if it works. The device, seem to over heat and I have to keep on unplugging it or just use it for a  very short period of time.

October2013 Its not even a year yet, and this item does not work anymore. I tried to call the customer service, but it let you wait for so long. I cant even get a replacement or get my warranty. So far, very dissapointed.",0
"Not sure where to leave this feedback, but I have now been sent the ""Clay"" pomade twice, despite having ordered the ""Hard Cream"".  Since the above image is clearly not what is being placed in the box to ship, not sure how to reconcile that.  The product itself is great, just not what I have ordered.",0
"I bought this because I saw an article on PureWow saying your hair will be dry in 3 minutes. I have long thick hair and I usually have to wash it in the evening and style it in the morning as otherwise it takes too long to do both in the morning. However, now that might change. It didn't take me 3 minutes to dry my hair, it took me 4 minutes and 10 seconds. I timed it because I was curious. I'm very happy with that result
I gave it 4 stars however because it came with no lid and was just shipped loose in a cardboard box.",1
"I have sensitive, acne prone skin. I wanted to like this sunscreen but unfortunately it broke me up and so I returned it after a week of use.",0
"I don't know how other people are giving good ratings for this brush from this particular supplier but I received a fake one! This brush does not sit properly on the clarisonic machine head that I bought from Sephora. When you turn on the machine, it would vibrate but the bristles (green) wouldn't move at all. I wasted my money I had to go buy this from Sephora and it works fine now. Don't fall for ""oh this is so cheap on amazon"" moment",0
"Only for extremely oily skin, dried my face out, gave it away.",0
Love the way it removes the excess dirt n oil from my skin I use it every morning. And it's a great toner  I will forshure me ordering again,1
This makes my hands feel soft and smooth.,1
Love this product,1
"Very greasy, to a point it's in ur skin",0
"It is a great smell, and huge, but does not smell as good as the very expensive Body Wash. I actually bought it to smell and not to wash with.
Highly recommended.",1
Gained weight,0
"I bought this product for mom as a christmas gift this year (Dec 24, 2016). At first, it works great, mom felt the ""difference"" between before and after using this eye massager. Until...nightmare started to reveal, after using this product one or two times, there was more winkles appear under her eyes than before using it with which like minor winkles that doesn't even show much. Also, this product claim to have two kind of massager function. However, I can only tap into the spa function... So people, just be aware if you planning on buying this product. -.-''",0
"Best smelling hairspray you will ever buy. Doesn't even smell like hairspray, it could be a subtle perfume. Not at all stiff. In fact, you can hardly tell you have it on your hair. Which isn't great for hold- but it's perfect for use with a curling iron or if you just want really soft hold/thickening. It's almost like a dry shampoo, but not at all chalky.",1
"I have used this product before and loved it. However when I went to use this bottle, the foam came out an awful green color and when I squirted a bit on my sink it dyed my sink an orangy green color for a week. I will be not be buying this product from this vendor in the future.",0
"I have been using the BaBylissPRO for awhile now! My opinion of this product is GREAT. Find it smooth, fast and effective",1
Awful! the first one I got wouldn't turn on so I returned it and amazon sent a replacement. I usually curl my hair with hot rollers so I got this to try something different and no matter how long I kept this on my hair it wouldn't curl it. I am returning this and going to find a better one.,0
Good air power but was less than impressed for the money it costs. Doesn't really get hot enough to style,0
"Ordered a size large, should have been labeled a small. Sewn very narrow at the hips- nice fabric and design/ disappointed it didn't work.",0
"product works pretty good, but not great.  I love everything else I've tried by this brand.",1
Bot well packaged and cream was not sealed. When I opened it It didn't feel like a new cream.,0
Best product for softening hair. Worth the price every few months,1
the cover is broken. and it should not be sealed if it is new?,0
"Beautiful color, smell, taste, and has slight plumping effect.  My third tube.",1
"I got this to replace a previous Hot Tools dryer.  I don't like how the concentrator nozzle and the diffuser attach to the dryer.  Instead of the old style where the attachment fits easily over the end, but these attachments sort of screw on, the tabs line up and then twist to secure it together.  Problem is, they don't easily unscrew.  I put the diffuser on and I literally can't get it off without probably breaking the plastic tabs that connect it.  Well that's unhelpful.  I returned it.",0
"Applied a substantial amount on upper and lower lids and it's completely gone in less than two hours. My skin isn't dry or oily around my eyes, so that is not a causative factor. IMHO, there are MANY eyeliners that cost less and work better.",0
"This cream works on skin with tiny pores. This cream settles into the enlarged pores on and around my nose, making me look polka-dotted. I tried using primer underneath, and it still doesn't work. The cream sits on the skin for about 45 minutes before gradually becoming natural. It works if you have a long commute to work, giving the cream time to sink in. Until then, I look like I'm wearing a mask.",0
"Lipstick good, really treats, beautiful packing, it is pleasant to use, but it would be desirable brighter and saturated color",1
This leave in conditioner made my hair feel heavy and oily. I will not be using it anymore.,0
I have used many self tanners over the years and was very excited to try this top rated mousse.  Unfortunately I have an allergy to the product and my skin became very red and inflamed.  I have used Tanwise mousse with no skin reaction problems so I would recommend that product to anyone who experiences skin reactions to this product.,0
"Excellent product for brush shaves, and one of the few available. Convenient and fast delivery. Proraso is the classic product for this who use a brush...",1
Simply put...you can not beat the Solano Original!  The product is structured well.  Very durable.  I recommend this product for every girl that needs a blowdryer. It does not get too hot and fry your hair. It still dries your hair in a timely matter.,1
"This made my chest and back acne worse than I've seen it in a long time. Granted, maybe my body had already planned to freak out in acne before I started using this. However, it did nothing to help the situation. I also made the mistake of using this on my lady parts which proved quite irritating. Ps the smell was not good.",0
I used another brand of Rapid Dry before I ordered this. That product dried my nails within seconds of spraying. This OPI spray doesn't do much. It may speed up the drying process but once you've sprayed your nails don't expect your nails to be dry... it'll still take 5 mins or so to dry completely and not have smudges. I won't be buying this again.,0
Perfect for adding volume without teasing hair. Also helped add texture for updos.,1
"I discovered the products in France and was trying to find an other one to match the performance of the first one, called ""serum Merveillance expert"" this is a good product ,their entire line is great .It compliments my product perfectly ,I wear it over my serum  in the day time. I could find the same in a US product I think ,but I wanted to stay with the same company",1
Had an old  smell to it :(,0
I have purchased several of this item and also reccommend to everyone that compliments me on my lashes.however the last one I received was dried up the brush was crusted dry...very disapointment because this is an expensive product.however this is an amazing product it really does work..,0
Too thick and clumps.  It made my eye area more dry.  Not sure why this had such a high rating.,0
"If you are looking for a more ""environmentally friendly"" nail polish, use SpaRitual instead.  I have given the Zoya NP's several go's but have been disappointed.  Thick and streaky at the same time.",0
I like it the smell is amazing,1
After reading all the great reviews I thought this would be the perfect product. But it was not. It makes a total mess everywhere and leaves a funny texture in your hair.,0
"It does lubricate well and allows a very close shave.  HOWEVER, it produces some serious soap scum that not only covers the sink, but clogs the DE razor I use as well.  Best used with a straight razor, IMO.",1
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I bought one a little over one year ago and about 3 months ago, the battery stopped charging. Now, the customer service representatives were nice and tried to help me trouble shoot the issue. They even sent me a free charger. But, it's just not a quality product. I literally threw it in the garbage less than 10 minutes ago. Very dissapointing because I paid well over 400 dollars. I hate to say bad things about a company's product but this one's a rip off.",0
Love it but it is so small it could be a sample,1
"Very drying to facial skin, and actually accentuated imperfections",0
Rip off stuff did not work,0
"i never seen any conditional like this before.
no form,bad smell, lots hair off.
pls do not wasting your money on this",0
"I must have liked it because it's one of the few products that I have started and finished already. Nice texture, not greasy at all for my oily skin.
Not sure that it really helped lift anything but it felt really nice on the skin.",1
awesome product for hair with a natural wave.  just enough hold to look natural and not crispy.,1
This oil has totally reversed my winter dry itch. This has been a harsh winter and my scalp along with many of my hair clients as well have been affected by the extreme temperature. This oil is the perfect solvent. The smell is strong but shampooing takes much of that smell away.,1
"While I do like the product, the price fluctuates more than any other skin care product that I have ever used. When I purchased last I paid $30.71 for the 1.5 oz.  The time before it was $46.95. This was over a 16 month period.  What is up with this pricing policy?",0
"Ive heard alot of positive feedback on this bronzer, so I figured i would give it a try. Ive never used this line before so I was a little skeptical, but figured the least that could happen is that i don't like it... well needless to say I wore it today and must say that its truly amazing! the color pay off is just fabulous, its lightweight, gives the right coverage/sheen/sparkle/shimmer but does not over power the rest of your makeup.. the shimmer isn't obnoxious like some products ive tried, this stuff is my absolute FAVE! I am very pleased with my purchase...

Not to mention the seller is one of the absolute best on Amazon! I have ordered many products that have arrived in almost two weeks, but I ordered this and received it within just a few short days! You won't regret your purchase, its a must have for me!

thank you!!!! i am one happy customer!!!",1
Felt great but broke after 2 months of occasional use.,0
"I use traditional wet-shaving methods and this is my second favorite of the Proraso soaps.  However, they are also a great way to add some ritual to cartridge shaving as well and will provide a far more pleasant shaving experience than the chemicals in a can so many men use.  I personally prefer the menthol and eucalyptus version, but both lather up exceptionally well (even with my hard water) and provide a smooth shave.  It does not have a particularly strong scent that I could notice, and I was hoping for more sandalwood.

Overall, a solid product but after purchasing the other scent I would not use this again.  But, like anything with shaving, your results may vary and I encourage you to try both before settling on a favorite.",1
"Wow! I've tried several skincare lines and received training is so many (I work in esthetic field). I am very positively surprised how good ingredients are and how good my skin looks and feel after using it.
Basically if you apply moisturizer and 30 minutes later your skin feels dry it means it was mostly water. Invest in a good skincare- skin the largest organ we have, selfies are 90% of the picture and skin will represent you for a long time.
I use it am and pm, it's just great, not too heavy, a little goes long way.
Now I'm curious about the whole line.

Have a healthy skin!:)",1
"It smells and feels great, but it burns if you get it in your eyes. Also, the fragrance is strong enough that you can taste it when cleansing and I'm not talking about getting it in your mouth.",1
Really helped my nails get back on to healthy.,1
This was recommended to me by my dermatologist and I thought I liked it but I have sensitive skin and after a week I started to get a rash.,0
This does not seem to be the same product I get at the beautiy salons.,0
"I have 4c natural hair. This product
Is ok. It didn't perform as well as some of the store bought products like as I am. I wouldn't purchase again.",0
I wanted to upgrade to a more luxurious shampoo since many dandruff shampoos i have used smell awful. This one comes in a giant bottle and smells good. It leaves my hair feeling very clean. I would recommend this one if you are okay with average dandruff support but awesome smell and feel. The price is high but it seems that is just the cost of fanciness :),1
"Very small container, and not what I expected.",0
Smells great. Bought as a gift for my sons. He loves it.,1
"A waste of money.

Any spring water in a spray bottle will work better than this.",0
It's ok! I need something that gets polish off faster and is stronger!! It's not that strong!,0
"Love it,.not to sweet, not to strong.",1
Use this product before blow drying my hair. Works great.,1
Noticed nothing different. It does smudge. Not great for inner rim or outside for that matter.,0
Exceptionally good product.  Have used this off and on for many years.  If you have a zit this will take care of it overnight.  Doesn't dry out the area that you put it on or make the skin irritated as other products.  I recommend this highly to everyone.  You will be thrilled with the outcome.,1
bad product. bounce my money the worst shampoo,0
This curling iron gets so hot that it fried my hair. I am pretty disappointed. Even at the lowest temperature it burns. I had to unplug the curling iron in order to finish curling the rest of my hair. It does curl the hair but it also burns your hair.,0
"Very unhappy with this purchase. It was for a Co-worker for her birthday. I was going to give it to her tomorrow. Now I can't.

The product came in a damaged box. And the tantilzer wasn't sealed and even better, the product was broken and all over the place.",0
Too smudgy and cakey on eyelids,0
amazing product,1
"This is nice.  It does impart nice shine and it does detangle.  I've tried about a dozen Philip B products through Amazon over the past couple of
years and like them all.  Yes I'd buy this product again.",1
"I bought it because  love my fhi runway flat iron and I had an amazon gift card worth 50 bucks. Unfortunately this curling iron doesn't properly grip the hair for a proper curl. The tip to the middle of the clamp, clamps fine but them middle  to the bottom of the clamp will allow the hair to slip right out. So if your hair is medium to short(shoulder or shorter this mightn't bother you.  However for those of us with long hair an need the full barrel to curl the full strand in a time efficient manner this is a problem.  I have modified the way I use it. I wrap my hair around it like a curling wand so  its not a total waste of money. When I get a chance I plan to take it somewhere and pay someone to remove the clamp.  So it really becomes a wand or tighten the clamp so its a better curling iron.

***Oh yeah it does go up to 210 Celsius which is 410 fahrenheit.  I read the instructions for how to switch the display form celsius to fahrenheit but never found that feature.",0
This item was just ok. I wasn't thrilled with it. I found a one step gel that lasts longer and is stronger than this.,0
"I have never had large flakes come out of my hair, until I used this conditioner. It detangles well and leaves hair soft. The smell is awful and it leaves a build up on my hair. I would rise my hair out well...it didn't make a difference.",0
it is broken :(,0
I never discussed this product with my hair stylist but last time I saw him he said my hair was thicker and asked what I was using.  I feel like it does make my hair fuller.,1
"Just had to throw an old one of these away. The springs stopped working properly. However, good news!! The new irons come with replacement springs just in case. This must have been an issue with older models. This iron is easy to use, doesn't burn the hair and gets really hot. A super long cord, too.  I have long hair and this 1 inch works fantastic with curls. I would highly recommend!!",1
"We LOVE this scent -- clean & fresh, not too perfumed.  Washes off so clean.  The giant bar (egg shaped) is a little hard to handle at first, but I love how long the bar lasts the 2 of us.  The long last also helps justify the high price.  We try other soaps, but keep coming back to this one. Also makes a really nice gift. The box alone is super quality with nice black ribbon around, the inner soap is set in tissue.  I get lots of positive feedback when I gift it.  I haven't tried the other scents yet, might need to splurge for their sampler set someday.",1
Bought this for a friend,1
"Perhaps my expectations were set too high based on the reviews here or maybe I'm not used to using this type of product. Shaving with this felt and smelled no better than rubbing my face with a bar of soap. I've been shaving with a safety razor and brush for a few years, so I'm not a newbie. For this price range, I was expecting a premium experience. I didn't get it.",0
Good product.,1
"This is a good lip balm that isn't too waxy and isn't too thin.  It's got the consistency of something like carmex lip balm.  Smells quite nice; grapefruit.  No odd tingleyness to it or anything, just a simple, good lip balm in a good container for it.",1
"I thought this would make a classy, thoughtful gift. Instead, the outer box is dinged and torn, there's no nail file, and as others have noted the polish remover is less than half full.  Looks like it was purchased at a dollar store.

I'll send it right back but I'm stuck without a gift for a special person.  :(",0
"I LOVE the way Oribe products smell and that they contain essential oils. Very pricey though and I am extremely disappointed as this product actually makes my thick, curly hair frizzy rather than smoothing and sealing out humidity. Wish I could return for a refund or exchange. Maybe I got a bad batch?",0
One of the jars was empty. Felt like I got ripped off.,0
Makes my eyes sting.  Love their face cream however.,0
it smells horrible,0
Like it !,1
They weren't sealed when I received them and the packaging looks dirty. Very disapointed,0
I was looking forward to the gorgeous scent of bergamot. Upon opening the box I was instead blasted with the gag-inducing odour of really bad perfume. Nothing about this smells like bergamot (or fresh -- or even old! -- tobacco).,0
Moisturizing qualities are good but the smell was far too flowery for me. I thought this would smell more almond-y.,0
I was unable to get the bottle to spray - tired & tired.  Cannot put on hair any other way.,0
Although I bought this from a high end drugstore which offered 50% off $130 (and not thru Amazon for $98) I felt I needed to submit a review. The container is cumbersome and there is an unpleasant odor that somewhat dissipates over time but still lingers. I can't return it to the drugstore but could have to Amazon. My bad!,0
"I have rather serious allergies, and everything makes me break out in hives.  I've been a use of a competing product for almost 30 years.  But, it leaves white streaks on my clothes.  I'm tired of looking like the chalk stripe on ""CSI"".  So, I gave this a try and was happy that it was not only as effective as the other product, but - no more looking like a victim on the sidewalk.  Although it does destroy my chances of Mariska Hargitay looming over me, this does smell better and it's nicer to my clothes.",1
"Since I have been using the HydroStem 6 I have noticed my skin looks smoother. I haven't been using it long enough to tell if it is reducing the appearance of wrinkles, but I definately will keep using it.",1
"I'd describe Proraso as the most cost effective of the premium shaving creams on the market.  Many people (such as on BadgerAndBlade) cite Proraso as the best and/or their favorite shave creams, for good reason.  The creams lather up fast, rich, slick, have classic and very appealing aromas, and are among the very top performers on the market -- for only about $10/5.6 oz, or one of the best values in the shaving world.  Proraso Red (sandalwood & shea butter) which they market for tough beards, is even a bit slicker than the Green.  I love them both.",1
"I'm not sure if it makes any difference, but as a body lotion it's good. I wouldn't pay all this money to use it again.",1
"It stopped working halfway into curling my hair for the first time using it. I had to get another (less expensive, simpler) curling iron from CVS, and that one has been reliable.",0
"It's a lot cheaper than buying it from the manufacturer when you buy it through Amazon, and I see no difference between the quality of product between other shippers and the actual manufacturers.  I have to use this product with derm-match, because it doesn't fill the void very well without it. But I do like it and will keep using it until I can actually afford a hair transplant.",1
Something wrong with the formula,0
I use this product every morning and am OBSESSED!! My skin is plump and hydrated. The glycolic is very gentle so my skin looks fresh without harsh exfoliant. Definitely reduced redness too,1
Yuk.,0
"I have been searching for a good cleanser for my chronically pissed off skin and this is it! Up until now everything that I have tried left me with red angry skin so I'm thankful for both the image vital C cleanser and hydrating cream. I bought these here on Amazon after using samples from my salon facial  for two weeks. its rich but light, very gentle, smells wonderful.",1
It's an awesome product it doesn't flake and it lasts all day.,1
"FAKE!!!! Give me my money back!

I do not know what this stuff is but it dried me out and got me all flaky and dull. I have oily/combination skin and this stuff is awful! I really want a refund. I loved the retinol and the toner I got from this company, but this facial cream is terrible.",0
"Best lubrication from a shave product I have ever used.  You really only need a small amount for big performance.  Only thing keeping me from 5 stars is the cost.  But honestly, it lasts a long time so it is worth the money and I keep buying it.",1
Shipped quickl And product as advertised. Good scent collection.,1
I have used this product for years it gets my hair perfectily straight and i have a white fro no joke but this chemical is strong so be careful if you only have a slight wave don't use this use rusk # 2,1
Great price  Authentic product.,1
Good eyeliner. Waterproof and easy to use.,1
It's a good iron. It just takes longer to heat up than I'd like. Plus it loses its heat while you are working with it so you have to wait for it to heat back up.,1
"It was a great price, and I use it daily.  Yeh, it's like a mousse, but that's OK.  Seems to work.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I hate I have to use it in the first place.",1
"I'm encouraged, but, too soon to know if I LOVE IT.  I'll feel more certain after trying full-size face tightener once more (doubt if I'll buy eye or neck cream again).  This product line is EXPENSIVE so, its gotta work, for me to continue buying.",1
I have never had long nails my whole life. After using nail envy for 3 weeks as it says my nails look beautiful! I highly recommend this product and make sure to use as the directions say. My nails have always been brittle.,1
I can't tell/feel the difference between this and more 'commercial' products.,1
"This will not fit a standard size shaving brush. Luckily, I used some ingenuity and mounted it to my wall upside down. Now it fits my shaving brush and provides a sufficient amount of surface area to place my straight razor on top of. Don't expect to sit this on your counter and believe it will hold a full size shaving brush though.",0
Exellent,1
"not enough uses to determine lasting effects, yet.",1
I didn't receive anything. The package is empty,0
"I really can't tell a difference that this is even on. It was not effective for me, unfortunately. Baby powder is much more effective. It's a shame because the product was very costly.",0
"This is my second Ahava hand cream product to try, and while I did not like the first one, I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I may have thought to give it 5 stars but the price and the scent.

The price is out of my reach at just over $28 (at time of this review) for under 4 ounces. I do firmly believe that we should not expect everyone to sell their products for so cheap they can't stay in business or make a profit, but this is still pricey. And yes, I believe you do get what you pay for, but when I ask myself would I purchase this for almost $29, it would not fit in my personal budget.

The cream is thick and a sand-brown color.

The scent is not cloyingly sweet, which I did like, and has a bit of spice scent to it, but it also has an underlying scent that I don't care for and can't quite put my finger on. I'm glad it's not flowery grandmotherly sweet or powdery scented, but wish the spice scent came through even more. It's almost plasticy? Or?

What deserves a high rating is how SUPER SOFT my hands feel. It does take a little bit to rub it into the skin and let it absorb, but my hands feel so amazingly soft.  I'm keeping this by me when I'm writing or editing so when my hands become dry, I'll have it close. I'd definitely use this for travel--it's small enough and concentrated enough to take with me. If not for the price, I would love to rub this into my entire body, and on my feet after giving myself a pedicure, but at this price I'll use it for my hands only so it lasts.

The ingredients list sounds interesting, but honestly it's difficult for me to make a determination on how those things work at a cellular level on our skins. For a hand cream, since we wash our hands frequently (everyone should be!), most of it washes away (unlike, say, a face cream or body cream), so you have the hope that for this price some of the product does its ""thing"" on more than the top layer of your hand's skin before it's washed away.

I recommend if you are looking for a really great emollient hand cream that makes your hands super silky soft and price is not a consideration for you in your personal budget.",1
"My husband loves this perfume. I bought him the set a couple of years ago at Macy's. We've tried to purchased it again at Macy's but I'm thinking it's discontinued, so when I found it online, I knew I had to surprise him with it for his birthday. He loves it. It got here right on time. The only reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's not the Eau De Parfum one. I can't seem to find that one. But I guess it's the scent that counts.",1
I love the color of this polish!,1
Gguj,1
I thought it was straight argan oil to be used on the skin. But all is not lost because my hair dresser sells this and I told her I'd give it to her. In turn she gave me a really great skin care product. But I DO like argan oil. Never used it on my hair since its shiny and not damaged.,1
Beautiful color and the shipoing was fast and easy. Zoya is a favorite nail polish of mine. Awesome awsome awsome,1
"Didn't find this effective for my nails at all.  I am a nurse and constantly washing my hands.  My nails dry out, crack, split and peel.  Bought this at the encouragement of a friend and applied exactly as directed...  Reapplying every couple days is annoyting, but did not find it was effective even with reapplying daily.  For me it just did not do the trick.",0
Love this lotion!,1
"Not only does it soften my skin from a high-impact sun, it also smells great.",1
"I love the actual oil. Its good for sensitive skin. Shame on Anthony for switching to an inferior package from the older glass bottle. The plastic bottle has the same problem that they've had in the past--the paint flakes off and gets EVERYWHERE. on hands, in hair, in shower, on sink, in towels and is really difficult to remove...because its PAINT. Cleanup requires sometimes as much as a few minutes and that is not something you want in your morning routine. I had to wrap the package in packing tape. Do not keep in shower--if it gets too wet, you will suffer greatly.

With the older glass bottle packaging, you could even soak in hot water to heat up the oil.

*i took the photo after wrapping with clear packing tape.",0
"I have recently received this product. I was concern that the reviews were all fake. But after using it for a week I have seen a difference. My skin is still oily but my pores have gotten smaller and I have seen that when I do break out they dry out faster. My husband has also seen a difference and even asked me "" what are you using ? Your skin is so soft "" I told him about the clarisonic mia 2. I also have been seeing that my skin looks more youthful. Can't wait too see what 6 months of using this will do. If I've have seen results in little as a week. I so recommend this product to everyone with oily to acne prone skin",1
I liked it but it has a sound when is working and then I turn it off,1
It doesn't smell like the original/real one. I wonder if it's fake.,0
"My husband and I both use this razor.  It has completely replaced my Venus razor, which I had previously loved.  We purchased two more because I accidentally broke it when it dropped on the porcelain tub; he's making me get my own now.  It's very durable, but with kids, my sleep deprived self, and both of us using the one razor and constantly changing the blade it took it's toll.  If you have sensitive skin or are prone to razor bumps this helps a lot. I rated it four stars because changing the blade is a little tricky in my opinion.  I've never gotten cut yet, but I always worry I will.  I'd give it four and a half but that's not an option!  The shave is super smooth, and in the long run, we've saved more money with this razor.",1
"My only real complaint is that I would have liked to have the handle be slightly longer.  Shaving with a safety razor takes some practice and you will probably nick yourself a couple times.  However, the savings of replacing your blades at 10 cents each is worth it.",1
Glass arrived smashed. Insufficient packaging. Smells nice though.,0
made me break out more than ever,0
This polish is lighter than I expected it to be. It is also strong. I can smell it through the package.,0
Highly ranked by dermatologists and doctors for its protection.  I wasn't that impressed.  It left a slight residue (besides being greasy) to the skin.  Made your skin look slightly gray and if hot outside it seemed to melt into the creases in your elbow area and turn white again.  Not something I would recommend.,0
I love this stuff. It makes your hairy silky soft and smells great and you only have to use a tiny amount.,1
Horrible mess. The tip was melted. Its cold in Ohio so cant blame the heat :(,0
Don't like it.  The scent does not stay on at all,0
It may be that I bought the wrong style brush...but I do have trouble getting the paddle-style brush through my thick but fine hair.  I think these might be overrated.,0
"Love this stuff!  Can't say enough about how easy it is to apply and the results are AWESOME!  No streaks, no orange weirdness, no strong smell, and it dries SUPER fast!  I love this product and HIGHLY recommend it.  I bought it on Amazon for a much better price than you can find in stores (Ulta) - LOVE Amazon :)",1
Great brushes. I'm a professional hairstylist and I use these in the salon as well as recommend them to my  guests.,1
Good product that works,1
"Privet Bloom's notes sound lovely, but it has an incredible biting sharpness I can't identify. It's neither galbanum nor citrus, and it has a very synthetic feeling to it. It has excellent longevity on me, being still noticeable on my skin 16 hours later! In this case, the longevity is a minus, alas. I've read some good reviews of it, so would suggest trying before buying a bottle so you can know whether it's good on you.",0
"This is the 2nd time I've bought this. I am in LOVE! It makes my skin so soft, smooth and fresh looking. It is rather expensive but it will last a really long time and it's way cheaper than going to get a chemical peel. You only need to use a small amount for great results.",1
This cleanser does nothing for my face. I have oily skin and breakout sometimes monthly. It does nothing.,0
The sprayer is not a very fine mist...and it's too expensive.,0
the patches are kinda dry.,0
"This hair product was introduced to me,, while i was in Beverly Hills. It doesnt hold your hair down like others, its fresh and does exactly what it claims it does, Anti humidity, if u live in the south or any were u want this product to help with your styles. It also is so fresh the next dayu don't have to redo it...",1
"I don't have many wrinkles, but a few are forming around the mouth area.  Ive been impressed with other Vichy products, and thought this might help.  The box touts, instantly skin appears dramatically smoother and plumped and in eight weeks youthfulness is visibly improved.  My first application burned and shortly afterwards my upper lip area resembled something akin to using a bad hair removal creamred and patchy skin.  I was glad I had no plans for the day.

This is the first time I've used a retinol productis this to be expected?  Even worse, that area looked even drier and tighter as the day went on.  I didn't think my skin was sensitive, but Im afraid to try this product again.  I followed directions, used it sparingly and applied to a clean face.",0
Gets my hair caught in it.,0
"Provides good coverage, and the spray bottle is really convenient for hard to reach areas. Feels a bit oily going on, so you should let it set a bit before putting on clothes or makeup.",1
I usually love OPI better than Essie and all of the other mid priced nail polishes but this one is different.  What ever they are using for the Infinite Shine makes the polish go on too thick and sticky.  I do love the color though!,0
"I used this product in conjunction with Volumea Shampoo in hopes that it would give volume to my fine hair.  I used it for three days and the only thing it gave my hair was more static electricity.  I live in Utah, and maybe it would be more effective in a more humid climate.  So unless you live in the tropics, have money burning a hole in your pocket or are performing a scientific experiment I would refrain from buying this product.",0
Didn't care for it,0
This Nail Polish I saw one famous beauty blogger Liza on air. I liked it and I ordered it myself. Color is very beautiful. Rich red-brown. What you need for fall and winter.,1
Toppik has helped me gain some of my confidence again. My thinning hair looks 10 times thicker after I use it. Great product and the only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because the powder can tend to be a little messy if your in the wind.,1
"Horrible shipping shave oil cap was loose and leaked all over other items - no oil left and brush saturated, and film on remaining items",0
"Love this stuff! I have been using it intermittently for 3 years now. It helped me grow out my nails after removing acrylic & also stops my nails from tearing off when I am doing housework. A must have for anyone with weak nails!

I have it 4 stars bc it can be hard to find at times.",1
BEST.LIP.BALM.EVER,1
fair price for what I received,1
The color is a dull grayish color instead of black,0
Didn't really do much on my scars but it did tone my face and made it noticeably lighter.,1
"Does not blend well, it comes off easily. Had to reapply my whole foundation 2 hours later.",0
"I applied this product overnight to dry a spot. It ended up being red and inflammed. Took a week to heal. I put it in the rubbish, not for me.",0
"My wife's second unit just burned out after two years of light to moderate use.  There is a screen in the cord end to prevent ""things"" from getting caught in the fan, and making there way to the heating elements.  But once that screen is blocked by bathroom lint, the unit overheats and then quickly fails.  There is virtually no way to clean the screen.  The end cap isn't a press fit and has no fasteners.  It appears to be heat welded.  You must break it to get at the screen.  For half the price, and if I could stomach the waste, I might think replacing the unit so often is OK.  But this unit is too expensive given its planned obsolescence.",0
Great for exfoliation and has been helping to improve my complexion. Prone to break outs and uneven skin tone. Definitely helping w that. Wearing less and less makeup (concealer) which is always a good thing.,1
Perfect match! Will order again and again.,1
I like this product a lot.  Feels good on my hair and I don't have to use shampoo and conditioner.,1
"I've used this stuff for a long while now, this specific one has a great scent to it too.",1
Well I bought this for my girl . I had sampled the men's and thought it had a great scent so I assumed the women's would as well. The women's has more of a powdery smell not to my liking. I prefer a vibrant deep scent not sweet that makes you remember the lady who is wearing it! So beware I'd advise you to go and check out the scent before you buy! The shipping process was great.,0
Definitely one of the best dry shampoos out there. Runs out kind of fast though.,1
This is by far the best product I have ever used on my face. It's expensive but worth every penny.,1
Refreshing and brightens the eyes.,1
Great toner. I use in combination with cleansing oil. Does not dry out my skin like some toners.,1
"I honestly don't know why people stopped using these and started using disposable razors. I bought my Merkur razor for environmental reasons, and I'm so happy I did. I was afraid to use it, because I thought it would cut me, but when I finally ran out of disposable razors, I had to break down and use my new one. Not only did it not cut me, I couldn't even feel it! The whole time I was shaving my legs, I kept having to check and see if it was actually taking the hair off, and when I was finished my legs were so soft and smooth. Highly recommend.",1
"This spray is so refreshing, moisturizing & smells great!  I highly recommend it!",1
"Caused me breakouts.  A few months back I was experimenting with some new more natural face washes, and at the same time I used this as a moisturizer, and I was getting major breakouts.  After switching back to benzoyl peroxide and getting my acne under control I needed a moisturizer and decided to try this again thinking that maybe this wasn't the cause of the breakouts since I tried a few new things at once.  Within a week I got huge pimples around my nose and on my forehead.

If it wasn't for the breakouts I'd say it's pretty good, but its not for me.",0
"I've been using this product for about a month, every other day for my sensitive skin.  There has been no irritation and my skin looks and feels smoother.  I started to see results after a couple of weeks, and have received compliments from my friends about my skin.  Would definitely recommend it.",1
Did not like it at all. Too thick and clumpy. I like the ceramide lash extending mascara better.,0
"Great product, it was given to me free by CARF and works well.",1
"This is a very nice bronzer for anyone who has a light complexion.  My skin tone is very pale in the winter and this bronzing powder works great to contour and add color to my face.  I really have been more and more interested in cream bronzers, but this is a nice powder option.  I find that cream bronzers look better on my skin as I have aged over the years.  powder bronzers look great on younger skin.  Nice compact with mirror.",1
This Borghese Make up I purchased seems to be extremely old. The texture is not what it should be and it has an odor. I've been using this product for a number of years and it never looked like this.,0
"I have an awful case of dry, flaky, itchy scalp and while this feels nice and tingly it has done nothing for the itching and flaking ):",0
This cleanser leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean.  Absolutely love Bioelements products.,1
It was very greasy made me break out,0
"I love this shampoo. I've been buying it in bulk for years now. I have curly hair and their moisture shampoo, conditioner and gentle conditioner (which is really a leave-in conditioner) are all great products.",1
Waste of money. Thought I was getting my regular rock hard gel. Tossed the box away so no refund. My bad since other may like light hold,0
"The curling iron stopped heating after 45 days, now doesn't work at all. It lights up, but no heat.",0
"Amazing make up remover, I use it every day",1
I like it,1
Small but worth the price to try the product to see if you really would want to lay down the cash for a full sized line.,1
Great product with good hold and a great finish. 4/5 stars because the vanilla smell is wayyyyy too strong. Especially on hot days(80 degrees F+) the is very noticeable to the people around me.,1
My favorite nude nail polish! It is universally flattering and I love the small amount of shimmer.,1
My son used it daily on his back for 3 weeks which is how long it lasted and did not see a difference :(,0
"Love this brand, good price.",1
"Wont hold a charge for a single haircut. It looks well made on the outside, but it is completely worthless.",0
"As others have said, it's very important to use just a tiny bit and follow the instructions on how to apply it, especially so since most folks getting this have thinning or thin hair.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny and sometimes I can even get away without using any additional toppik, which is great. Definitely glad I found this product and will be ordering more.",1
smells amazing ! just didn't last very long on me,1
"I'm not happy with this product. Unfortunately, it's 9 Ounce, rather than the smaller one I've had in the past. Perhaps it's the delivery system that is not refined enough. My fine hair ends up too coated & plastered. What I liked about the product originally  was the light weight effect. ... perfect for my fine hair. Now I have a rather expensive hair spray that I'm too frugal to toss out.",0
"This is a wonderful moisturizer (rich, non-greasy, truly hydrates)  recommended by the Aesthetician at a local spa but at half the price that they sell it for. Heckuva deal here.",1
"Davises products are pricey but high quality.  This mousse is no exception and works well in my aging, fine, curly hair that has a tendency to frizz in the summer humidity.",1
"This lotion provides protection from shaver burn and improves the shaver's cutting action - fewer passes and smoother shave. It does not provide any lubricity. I compared using lotion on one side of my face and bare skin on the other - switched sides the next morning. Other than the initial alcohol smell, which dissipates quickly, the lotion has no odor. The reasons for only 3 stars are its cost, small quantity and wasteful application method - a cotton ball is suggested. I would prefer something like a rollerball applicator so more of the lotion ends up on my face.

Update: I now realize that the cost is not out of line for pre-electric shave lotions, so I've added one star.

Update: I took a rollerball deodorant bottle and popped the ball out using a dull knife. After cleaning the bottle, I poured in the shaving lotion. Now, the lotion goes on easily and more goes on the face.",1
I bought this palette for the birthday of a friend. This one doesn't talk & doesn't work. I think I'll send you this item back.,0
Please take out the menthol,0
I don't notice much difference in my complexion unfortunately.,0
This moisturizer feels great on my face and provides just enough moisture for my oily/combination skin.  Much better than more expensive products I was using.,1
Works Well,1
"I purchased the Mustela 2-in-1 Hair & Body Shampoo at a local drug store because I had a coupon that made the purchase cheaper than ordering it from Amazon. I had read all the positive reviews and made my purchase based on that. I can't really address how well the product cleanses because I could not get past the smell. So many reviews described the fragrance as pleasant or fresh. For me personally, it was overpowering and smelled more like chemicals than anything I would describe as pleasant. When I opened the tube, I put a small amount on the back of my hand to see what the texture and smell was like.  I found the smell so overwhelming that I immediately washed it off. My hand still smelled an hour later and I had to get another soap to wash the fragrance off my skin. I realize the perception of pleasant/unpleasant fragrances is a matter of personal preference. I wanted to let those reading the reviews know that not everyone would find the fragrance used in this product appealing.",0
I've used this a few times. Love the scent. It doesn't leave my hair hard. I would recommend.,1
Fake,0
Not as great as I would be expecting. Wear out and don't look pretty after the first use. Will not be purchasing again.,0
"I always had a pretty rough relationship with sunscreens because when applied on my sensitive skin, they use to cause breakouts almost instantaneously. This phobia of sunscreen made me miss out on the trend of mineral based sunscreens. So after a pretty rough summer, I decided to give mineral based sunscreen a try and bought iS Clinical Eclipse because it was recommended by a couple of ""Top Ten Lists"" on the internet. This time around, I wasn't disappointed.
I am a 24 yr old male with an olive skin complexion and hyper pigmentation on one side of my face. The thing with olive skin complexion is that you can get tanned very easily. Thats a big plus if tanning happens uniformly but with me this is not the case. Therefore, I need to use a sunscreen. iS Clinical Eclipse is almost transparent and the best thing is, your face doesnt feel oily once you apply the product. I also noticed one thing else, whenever I applied this product on a wet face, an ugly pimple would end up rearing its head. So don't apply it on a wet face. After using this product for almost 6 months, I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",1
This fragrance is one of my favorites and finding it here was a plus. I bought this for my husband for Fathers Day. He loved it. I love the fact of getting a larger size and the after shave balm is exactly what I wanted. The scent is not too strong and yet it has a lasting effect. Great seller and fast shipping was a plus.,1
This was a refill so I have used Jane I red ale Pure pressed powder before.  I love the color and it covers my flaws.  I also get complements  when I use it.  People think my skin looks good.  It's on the expensive side but worth it.,1
Best curling iron ever.,1
"This is a new one from Claus Porto but I will openly state that it is one of the finest that I have ever used and strongly recommend it!  The new scent is very, very good and I seriously doubt if there will be many that will not like it right off. As so many others from Claus Porto, yes, this lasts much longer than a regular bar of soap while throughout it's use provides more softening results than most are commonly accustomed to.  The wonderful new scent lasts just as long too - to the very end!  These hand bar size will last ususally between one month to one & a half months per bar.  That's based on one usage per day.  The 12.3 oz. size bars will last up to 3 & one half months based on the same usage level.  That, in comparison to everyday  common soaps is incredibly longer and who would rather for the shorter period?? Basic thought along the dollar & cent line. . .  Again, I highly recommend this one to everyone!! Once you've used it you'll never go back to something else!!!",1
For the amount of money this cost it should have stayed on all day and all night...it failed to do so.,0
Smells like rubbing alcohol and leaves skin SUPER GREASY. I wanted to like this product people it is organic and I hate using regular rub-on sunscreen... but unfortunately this Coola Organic is quite off-putting in smell and texture that I've reverted back to using Coppertone Sport. I suppose I'll keep the Coola as a backup.,0
This smells like cotton candy. Love it. It's not that moisturizing tho.,1
It is my sisters perfume for ever,1
"Shame on OPI. There are two versions of this color with exactly the same name and product code. I liked this color at the salon, so I bought this for touch ups. It was more of a halloween green than the spring grass green in the salon.",0
Very disappointed in this product.  I wish I stuck to my usual order of the regular eye cream.,0
This was not what I thought it was. It is basically a piece of metal inside that you have bend into a round shape and hope it stays. My hair is long and straight and it did not seem to want to cooperate.,0
"I used the product one time and developed a severe allergic reaction.  The eyelids became red and very irritated.  The following day the redness was inside my eye.  Had to get prescription drops to get rid of irritation.  Although the company says that satisfaction is guaranteed for 30 days, they did not honor that because the item was opened.  Beats the purpose for guaranteeing satisfaction  if the item is not acceptable after it has been opened. Vendor is People-Buy.",0
This product has a foul smell.  It kind of reminds me of the smell when you let the air out of a tire.,0
"This is my go-to everyday eyeliner. It's not too hard to apply (and I am NOT a makeup pro by any stretch) and it easy to remove if you mess up. Stays on for a long time - there is some occasional feathering throughout the day, but nothing too terrible. I generally make it through a regular day in the office with no problems. Lasts a long time, though the felt tip does begin to unravel a bit after lots of use.",1
"It doesn't seem to matter who you buy this from. It works well the first time you use it and then it's like there is no product left in the tube. It says to shake it and I have tried that repeatedly, it doesn't help! I bought 2 from Amazon, thinking the first one I got was a dud, (like the other reviewer). Then I got a replacement for that one and the same thing. So I decided to go buy one from Sephora and guess what? It's the SAME! Grrr...... Nice product, Good Concept. Too bad you can only use it ONCE!",0
"I used this product for less than a week. The first few days was alright, but on the 3rd day, I started to see red bums appearing everywhere especially around my forehead. I started to worry then a few days following, I started to break out everywhere with cystic zits and white head pimples. I haven't broke out like this in years and somehow this product had made a huge impact on my skin. Trust me, I really wanted to love this product because I've been searching for nightcream for a long time; but this experience has been a very disappointing. I just filed a return hopefully Amazon will refund my money. huhuhu!!! :( :( :(",0
"I have been using round brushes to style my hair for about fifteen years. This square-round brush is great. Very lightweight, which is important because you have to hold your arm up with the brush in one hand, blow dryer in the other. It gets tiring! I felt less arm fatigue with this item. It also grabs the hair very well and leaves a nice shine to it. Highly recommend.

For the reviewers worried about the metal sides that get too hot - I don't find this brush to be very different from other brushes in this regard. Just as you might burn your skin with a curling iron or flat iron, you must practice the same caution when using any other form of heated styling tool. I consider this  brush to be a ""heated"" styling tool because I'm using the blow dryer along with it.",1
I could see where it was covering. Only needed help applying on my upper back that's just unreachable. Good color only lasted 5 days but not many self tanners are able to last very long. My boyfriend didn't like the smell. I've smelled worse. I used the tan intensifier which smells much better.,1
"LOVE this palette.  Super, crazy pigmented compared to other brands I've owned.  The middle color has a bit of a greyish/silver depth which I wasn't expecting, I thought it seemed a bit more cool brown but it's kind of a mix of both grey and cool brown.  My current favorite set of shadows.",1
I really loved this.  It left my hair feeling very soft.  Will continue to use.,1
"I work in the entertainment industry and my face needs to be crease free and glowing, even when I don't get the full 8 hours sleep. This is my first week using the pillow and have noticed my skin has not broken out and can honestly say my skin looks more supple.
In my opinion, I think my standard cotton pillowcase stripped my skin of oils and was actually aging me. So far I give this a 9 out of 10 in regard to feel and ""anti aging"". Compared to a silk pillowcase this does seem to have a bit of an edge re suppleness in skin. Not sure if that's just psychosomatic or because of the copper in this.
Overall, I give this a 9 out of 10. I would recommend this to a friend, albeit a friend who can afford a luxury pillow. If you are short on cash I would recommend a mulberry silk pillowcase ($35), but if you can afford it - go for it.

Important to note that I wash this with my regular laundry and it holds up very well. No piling or degradation of the fabric.

**If you found my review helpful feel free to mark it helpful. Also, feel free to ask me any questions about my review and to check out my page for similar reviews**",1
Amazing!,1
This flat iron worked great until the past week. I bought it in February 2017 and now in March 2018 it has stopped heating up as hot as I need it. I use it on the highest setting because I have thick hair. It no longer meets my needs as it doesnt get hot enough to straightener my hair. Very disappointed.,0
"I used to buy this from the dermatologist, but its less expensive here.  I was worried about buying it in the summer time, because i know how products may go rancid from transport in heat.  Had no issues. Love this product.",1
Works but makes hair feel chalky and dry. Does give volume though for up styles.,1
For the amount of money I paid for this product it's not worth the money. I have really dry feet and this product is not the best,0
"Keeps my polish from chipping a few days longer than without it. It never lasted a week, however, polish on my toes last at least 3 weeks or more.",1
"This is a surprisingly complex scent.  Initially, it's almost harsh.  And even though the publicity cites wasabi as one of the top notes, for me the first impression was of a strong ozone with spicy black pepper at the front.  As it dries down, it reveals a crisp ocean/salt water note accompanied by a definite woodsiness (cedar or pine, perhaps?).  This is the perfect gender neutral fragrance with only the slightest hints of floral.  But even though the floral is very downplayed, after about an hour, the scent this most reminded me of was a past favorite - Prada's Infusium D'Iris.  I have no idea whether the floral note in CK2 is iris or not, but the lingering effect is strikingly similar to the popular Prada fragrance.

The only reason I would probably not recommend this is that, similar to Infusium D'Iris, the lasting power is fairly weak.  While the scent did not dissipate completely over the course of the work day, the strength and complexity faded significantly within the first two hours.",1
"Excellent color - I have very pale skin and wanted something subtly-pink for pedicures.
Against my warm skin tone, this is a frosty pale pink with a white-ish silver shine.
After 2 coats, I did notice that I could still see the white of my nail through the polish, so I did a third coat on only the tips of my toe nails. The polish blended perfectly, covered the nails, and after the topcoat, you would never know the polish wasn't evenly applied.
I think this is a color that would look nice on most skin tones, and is very easy to apply neatly (because it is so pale).",1
"This eye mask is not advertised or priced correctly. It should NOT be priced at 13 dollars. That amount is essentially a robbery as this product has turned out to be laughably useless. How is it that the gel pouch could break and leak its contents after only 1 use? Amazon management: Where's the quality control here? Are there no standards in business anymore? No business deserves to profit from manufacturing such a poorly made and fragile product. Why didn't you say it was single-use and disposable? Is it because then people wouldn't pay 13 dollars for it?

A small, stupid and minor inconvenience but still yet another of a myriad of examples of why our country's economy and working and middle class are suffering: we are constantly underpaid and sold low-value products with slick advertising. Guess that's the American way...",0
"Hands down the best product I've ever used on my hair. My hair went through a rather tragic period where I (stupidly) decided to bleach it platinum blonde at home several times in a row, and my hairdresser told me that if I would've done it just one more time that my hair would have broken off at a length of about 2-3 inches long. After using this product for 6 months, my hair is the longest and healthiest it has EVER been! A small bottle lasts months, and it does wonders for even the most damaged hair. I've recommended this product to several friends who are all raving about it! But please, offer shipping to Europe! I live in Denmark and people are begging for a natural product like this one.

Lastly, the price is so right for this product. It's 50 times better than Moroccan oil, which I used for years. There is no residue, and it is more than worth the money. Highly recommended to anyone who wants healthy, shiny hair!",1
Not really doing anything.,0
LOVE THIS BRAND...LOCALLY THEY RUN OUT OF THIS SHADE.,1
"While this product isn't better than any hair product I've ever tried, it is definitely towards the top. Id buy again. It is definitely salon quality. The price is a little high.",1
"THIS IS NOT OBAGI PROFESSIONAL-C.  Ive used obagi C for over 5 years (mostly from different dermatologist offices) and it always stings/tingles just a little bit, makes face a little flush and makes skin feel silky.  this does none of that.  Its not even the same color.  I highly doubt there is any vitamin c in it.  Maybe I will do a litmus test,id bet  this stuff is very nuetral.  I will see if serum discolors over time too.  if you let real obagi sit too long, it does turn dark.  Save your money.  Im a real person, with real experience and this is just oil.  I'm pretty pissed, want my money back.",0
"I really like this starter kit. Though the price should be lower as there are comparable products that are much cheaper and I did expect a higher quality in the ingredient list though for the price. Maybe a more natural ingredient list.... no clue why I thought that. This kit comes with youth activating melon seurm, environmental protecting moisturizer, overnight retinol repairing creme and intensive exfoliating treatment. Everything is pretty self explanatory. I do think my skin is smoother and it is looking great. Honestly I like this product, I'm giving it 4 stars because it does what it says it does... and you don't get too much product in the starter kit, but a little bit goes a long way.  However, I have gotten the same results from cheaper products as long as I stick to the ""routine."" So, if you can afford this, give it a go, but if you need a more affordable product look elsewhere.",1
"Great serum; sits light on hair but very effective. I have fine hair so cannot use heavy product. This leaves my hair truly silky feeling and smelling great.  The packaging is really poor, though.  I have bought ~ 4-5 five of these over last  18 months and the pump does not work.  I just screw open the top and pour in my hand - which I would be doing with the pump anyway.  Just messier.  Still, a good product even if a little pricey.",1
One of the best,1
"So much darker than expected!! I've only worn it once because it was almost red to me... didn't like it! Very smooth though, good texture..",0
"Didnt stay put-could see little black clumps form that looked unnatural and stuck out against the hairline. What was worse was if I worked out, the dye they use for this product would cause the sweat from my head to turn green.",0
It's not the real deal..but for the price..its ok I guess.,0
"It got high reviews, so I tried it.  The alcohol-free oil seemed more conducive to skin care, and I liked it for shaving, but the scent just didn't do it for me.  Get a piece of pressed lumbar, inhale - you got a pretty good scratch and sniff of what it smells like.",0
Love this product never tried it before but I really like it and it was less expensive then buying in a store,1
Smells Great! Shipped well!,1
"I really like this liquid foundation. It goes on well, it feels nice on my face, it smooths evenly, I think it looks good.
I didn't break out after using it either, as is often the case with new makeup.

The only problem I had with this is figuring out what color Im supposed to get. I typically get the 2nd-to-lightest color in a foundation spectrum. This one, Sand, is a 3, but Im not sure if that is 3rd lightest or 3rd darkest. (Their 1 is ivory so maybe 3rd lightest? But then their 5 looks lighter than the sand but then the large color swatches all look the same to me)
The color of the container is MUCH lighter than the actual liquid, which is more like yeah, sand. However, it looks darker when it comes out, its a bit lighter than that when you actually put it on. It works for me, as long as I blend into my hairline and my neck well, but I would have been better off with a lighter shade.",1
I have naturally curly & frizzy hair.  For years I've used pantene shampoo & conditioner for curly hair and curls rock by catwalk for styling.  it worked great for keeping frizz down.  I tried Wen since I got a deal through swagbucks and was curious.  It was AWFUL.  worst hair days of my life.  I used as directed (with the conditioner and mousse) and had the frizziest hair of my life.  clearly their antifrizz does NOT work.,0
My nail polish came cracked I keep trying to send a message and I get no response $10 isn't cheap for a nail polish so it's upsetting when you get a cracked bottle,0
"Nothing special for the price. Pretty color, ,but chips and wears same as less expensive. I don't think it's worth the price",0
"CND Shellac is the best out there.  I recommend it highly when doing a manicure with an LED lamp.  I've used CND Shellac on my toes and fingers and as long as I use the CND base and top coats, curing them each for the required time under the lamp, the shellac does not chip and is long-wearing.

This particular color, Negligee, looked like a lovely pink and from the first few reviews (unfortunately, I only read the first few) it sounded beautiful.  In fact, this color is a very light, pale pink.  I am a non-tanning, pale blonde and this color does not show up very well and actually looks like I've only applied a clear coat of polish.  I did add another coat of a silver CND shellac over the top of two coats of Negligee in an effort to obtain some sort of visibility.

Perhaps this color looks better on someone with a darker complexion.  But if you are blonde and pale, stay away from this one.",0
My hairdresser has just told me not to use this product as it will strip the color / highlights from my hair.,0
"With the weather getting cold and warm it causes problems with my lips. I use this product at night before retiring, well my lips are soft not the chapped feeling.  I really like it, I just wish it came in a squeeze tube or chap stick style.",1
"This is my new favorite foundation. It's perfect for an active, outdoorsy girl like me. Just enough coverage and still feels lightweight. Lasts all day. Only thing is I think I am between the 2 different shade options but opted for the darker for the summer months.",1
"I love most of the Mario Badescu line, however, after applying a small amount in the morning, it still isn't absorbed by the evening. Perhaps I will try it as an overnight eye cream. Read a real simple review it is the best eye cream available, but it didn't work for my skin.",0
Expensive and didn't notice any difference in my hair frizziness,0
"Love the beard wash, the bush is nice, but the beard control I'm not a huge fan of. So overall I would recommend this kit",1
"Will be returning,  too cumbersome to hold, use; very awkward..",0
My face started bleeding jk,0
"love this gel, but when it got to me it had gone bad already.",0
Toooo hot,0
"Should've of listened to the reviews. Basically paying for high priced samples and can't even open them to ""sample"".",0
"I'm 53 and purchased this to add a little glow. I use very little,then a little foundation to soften brightness. I am pleased overall.",1
"There is only one reason I gave this one star and that is cost per oz.  I love this product, it takes everything off so well.  But don't buy the 250 ml size, it is only 8.3 oz.  Get the larger size, 16.24 oz, for only $6.00 more with Prime.  You are throwing money away buying 250 ml.",0
I really liked this at first but then the sprayer kept getting clogged. So I cleaned it every time I used it I have half a container that spits out the dry shampoo in white specs I have to shake & spray. I don't know if it's just a faulty can or what?,0
"Will be part of my regimen forever! I've recently run out of my usual moisturizer, and haven't gotten a new one because I want to try something new. In the interim, I've been using this as a moisturizer and it actually works well on its on. It's also great as a powder setting spray!",1
"Not for me...unlike face make-up for women that matches their skin tone, Toppik is problematic as you are literally throwing a fine dark powder on you scalp. Once on, it looks OK but touch your hair and you are immediately covered in dirt. If you are planning to not touch your hair or be anywhere near other humans with good eye-sight and do not care if it's obvious that you are masking your balding head with dark powder then this is fine.",0
"A little heavy, but still makes it easier to curl long hair. I have shoulder issues and this really helps. The curls look great but when you slip the curler out, pull down slightly and it will make the curls a little softer and not so corkscrew like. The curls look better the next day if you are fortunate enough to have the kind of hair that does not need to be washed every day.",1
My skin looks worse than before and I was using it twice a day along with Vichy face cleanser :(,0
"This particular hot air brush has only 250 watts. It is too Weak! It is about a quarter of the usual strength  of most hot air brushes, including some Helen of Troy versions that I have bought in the past. Hot air brush power can vary, but it is usually 1200 watts. The Amazon product description does not give power specifications, just barrel size. (Shame on Amazon)
However,  I also have some responsibility here because I have been buying hot air brushes for at least 15 years and I assumed standard product power and didn't double check. I should have been more cautious.",0
Generally an effective product.,1
"I have very good skin no breakout at all till I use this product, I have used the night and day strvectin ar advanced retinol for four night and days omg my face is all broke out I think it's the shae butter in it.",0
"I really love this face wash, BUT I only got to use it about 4 times before it stopped pumping out the cleanser. Couldn't remove the top to get the much remaining liquid. Definitely getting the squeeze bottle next time.",0
"First off, I love the color.  I don't have anything like this and I used it immediately upon receiving it (it was June's High Shine Club selection for me).

I did have to use 3-4 coats to really get it to be opaque, but light colors are often like that for me.  I think I am going to try it in the future over an opaque white polish; it should look great that way.  It was a good texture when wet (not too thin or too thick) and was easy to apply and I like the brush.  The finish on my nails is super smooth.

However, I did get chips on a couple of fingernails within 24 hours.  I had tried to be careful, and my nails aren't that long, so this was a little disappointing.  I touched up with new polish in the chipped areas and it's hard to tell I did any touch up unless you get really close.  So, I think my manicure will still last for a few days, though I expect to have to do more touch-ups now.  (I did peel a whole bunch of oranges and the polish didn't get messed up, so that was nice.)

I used a Seche Vite quick-dry topcoat with this.  I do have an Essie topcoat and I may try that next time to see if staying within one brand results in increased performance.  Overall, however, I'm pretty happy with this.",1
"I've been using this for two months and NOTHING has changed, not even slightly. I didn't get any tingling or any indication that this product was doing anything but I kept with it and still nothing. If I paid to have a one time facial with this stuff I would be furious! There is no date anywhere on the bottle so I can't tell if it's just expired or what.. I logged in tonight to find that I can't return it. I have an almost full bottle that I am just going to have to trash now. ONE UNHAPPY CUSTOMER!",0
"I read the reviews and was encouraged by the feedback; however, it did nothing for my acne. It had a strong odor, which I didn't mind, but it did have an effect on my skin. I am 25 and have a lot of small pimples on my forehead. I do get the frequent cystic pimple, which I would apply the lotion to with a q-tip. . . It dried it out a bit, but then it would remain red. Maybe it works for others, but not for me.",0
does the job well,1
"I have been using these product for 20 years and it is the first time the ampoules are not cutting properly and resulting in pieces of sharp glass stuck in my finger and on the floor, and spoiling the serum at the same time which makes it unusable. on 12 ampoules, 2 had this problem which makes them even more expensive since 2 are unusable. Very disappointing ...",0
"after reading all the reviews I thought I would give it a try. It's not for me! It's too messy and even after it has dried it smears on my face. When it starts to wear off it leaves a liner around the lips and the middle its gone! I would like to send it back, but I will give it to a close friend",0
"This product does not work overnight as promised and the smell is obnoxious.
It is not good for dry skin at all because it makes the skin even drier.",0
It's quite small!,0
The rollers are fine. The clips are AWFUL!!!! They don't hold the roller in place by any stretch of the imagination. I keep trying and hoping there's a magical way to make these suckers work but forget it - the rollers just dangle off your head & the clips leave dents in your hair from the dangle action. THE CLIPS ARE TERRIBLE AND DON'T HOLD THE ROLLER IN PLACE. They need metal pins but unfortunately I can't find any large enough.,0
"My kid's allergic to a lot of sunscreen, this is the only one she's not allergic to.  Not too thick, works well.",1
"Smells amazing!  Very refreshing to use, I love to use it after I work an overnight shift before I head home.",1
I used some of this product before and it was really strong and you had to be careful of it drying your skin. this stuff seems more diluted and is not strong or drying at all. doesn't work nearly as fast as stuff I've used in the past.,0
Strong and smells a bit fake.  I've got plenty of roses in my garden and they don't smell like this.  Maybe over time the scent fades a bit so I'll have to try again.,0
Not impressed with this box. Small compared to the other Amazon box I purchased at a less price. Most of the samples are perfume samples. Not really much else.,0
"Great! Half the price of 'off the shelf', including Wal-mart.",1
"I found this to be a very HEAVY fragrance and I didn't smell anything that resembled cotton. The packaging is nice, and it looks like a great gift as long as you don't mind a very heavy, strong scent. The smell wasn't exactly unpleasant but it wasn't what I would imagine at all from reading the description and being highly sensitive I found it overwhelming. If you are expecting a ""soft sensual"" fragrance I believe this is mislabeled!! Beware!",0
My favorite hand cream!!!,1
Paying for the brand. Doesn't clear acne,0
Smell is very unpleasant. I finally tossed it out,0
Awesome,1
"Took three coats to fully color in my nails and honestly, it looks like I dipped my nails in old motor oil.  Not too impressed with my first OPI purchase. Shipping was fast and securely packaged.",0
"Just a couple words it is the worst lipstick I've ever had! Not worth it, besides it smells terrible. I am dissappointed.",0
"I have naturally curly hair that is very thick and course. I love this product, and it keeps my curls well-defined and frizz-free without a greasy look.",1
Good product,1
Its not a week old and its dead!!!!!!!!,0
"I have used Nectifirm about 3 weeks.  There is a difference in the area of my neck.  The sagging isn't all gone but, there is a definite tightening that I'm please with.  I have had 2 compliments by people not knowing I'm using it, saying I look younger or I have lost weight.  I will continue to use it and I would recommend it to anyone with sagging problems.  Probably someone who is just starting to have the problem would have complete results.",1
Returned it. Didn't see visible results after suggested use.,0
Very good product.,1
"Light and easy to apply. This has been working well for me for last few weeks. Especially pleased with it's ability to keep away fly aways in this cold weather and dry indoor conditions. Don't need to use much for my just past my shoulders length hair. Nice light scent that is not at all overpowering. A little of this pomade goes a long way and lasts the most part of the day. Maybe a little pricey, but I would recommend it to friends, ect...",1
"I bought this with the foam cleanser of the same line because I read something that claimed both of them together would help keep my oily skin under control... that was wrong.  This thing actually made my skin oilier.

I did like that it was light weight but my skin felt sticky for a bit after.",0
I did not see any change in my skin tone after more than two weeks of using this product.,0
"I'm not sure if this particular product is actually Avene or a knock off. The packaging doesn't actually say Avene on it. Also I do not feel it gave any sun protection. The areas that I concentrated the product on ,like my nose, burnt worse than the other areas of my face.",0
"It was easy to use, however it did nothing for my hair. Tried using it in different styling techniques, nothing worked. I have fine hair so maybe that had something to do with that.",0
This is the powder dry shampoo. While I like the powder; the picture is of the SPRAY! Which is what I thought I was ordering. ,0
"So According To The Other Reviews This Smells Like Bubble Gum Or Marshmallows, But I Got Mine Exactly Like In This Picture But The Smell Is Not So Nice.
To Me It Smells Like A Dollar Cheap Perfume..
  Anyways You Try On Your Own Risk..",0
"Not 4 oz as stated, it's the 2.6 oz size... So not Such a good deal after all.",0
"I think you should include that this product does not work in the uk unless you pay more money for the adaptor because some people are unaware of this situation but other than that I loved my product it is a very good quality and I am happy with it, I was willing to pay for the adapter and other devices but some people wouldn't and I would just like to bring awareness of this but other than that thank you :)!",1
Toooo hot,0
We've used it twice so far and its worked so well. We use it with the Mustela Foam newborn shampoo and his Cradle Cap is almost gone.,1
"I made the switch to this from a cheap-o $5 Chinese razor because it was too mild for my thick, dense beard and it would tug at it as I shaved. This left razor bumps and gave me many ingrown hairs. I just used the 37C for the first time and what a world of difference it made! I used the same technique and products as I did with the $5 razor, but the 37C sliced through my tough beard much more easily and without any tugging. I have a few razor bumps but not nearly as much as before.

I can tell why everyone says it's more aggressive though. It did leave a bit more razor burn on my face than the previous razor, and I cut myself a few times. I'm still a bit inexperienced, though, and I think that with some practice I'll be getting a great shave with the 37C!",1
"Love the product, but it does me no good if I can not use it. Used it ""maybe"" four times and the spray nozzle does not work. Can is full, but no way to use it.",0
"This is an amazing product, and I have used it before. I purchased 2 more for back up, but for some reason they came without lids???? I don't understand why someone thought it would be a good idea to remove the lids before shipping???",1
I like this refreshing scent.,1
My shippment was opened and used already when it arrived ...,0
"The lather is really good, and the aroma is pleasant and light.  It doesn't last as long as others I've tried, but it feels good and doesn't clog the razor like some gels and shaving soaps.  Leaves me feeling clean.",1
This weighs down my curls and has a very strong chemical smell. When I use it my air purifier immediately turns on. I'm not sure what strong chemicals are in it.,0
Chipped off after one day.,0
"I made an impulsive decision at the airport yesterday and I got a water less manicure. Big Mistake. The lady used this product called ""Melt Away"" on my cuticles which literally melted away the skin on my fingers. So now I have raw open wounds around my nails and they hurt like a mother. Apparently if you are a skin-around-the-nails biter like me this stuff will react like napalm on your hangnails.",0
"The babyliss iron that I purchase did not work at all. When I plugged it in the light would not turn on. The iron came in a brand new box and everything appeared to be fine with the item, but that was not the case. I would NEVER order again!!!!!! It was a waste of time and money.",0
"If you want good looking hair, pay the extra money for an amazing product even a blow dryer your hair will love you a lot more and they'll last a lot longer. Compared to a chi or hot tools companies like sedu etc work better on your hair so it doesn't become as damaged from the heat compared to this one.",0
"Received the regular sized barrel, not the 2 inch extra long one like in the description and picture.

Item Description: Hot tools gold 1 1/2 inch curling iron/wand features an extra long barrel which is 2 inch longer than best selling iron. The rotating cool tip heats up to 430 degrees and includes a rheostat temperature control. Also comes with heat -resistant mat to protect counter top. 1 year warranty.",0
"Exercise caution when ordering this product. I have used Rx retinols in the past without issue, but my 60 yr. old face is now an eruption of cystic acne since starting on this cream!!! Must be some other ingredient that can irritate or clog pores. I am sticking with Mario Badescu from now on. Wasted $50.00-wish I could get a refund, but Amazon will only accept new items for return!!!!!!",0
The holes in the top are not sufficient to make the powder come out as it should. Only about 1/3 of the top is designed with holes to shake out the powder.,1
This does leave my hair shiny but it has alcohol in it. I really don't see how this protects my hair from heat. My hair feels dry like I've used a spritz. It holds pretty well but left my hair kind of crunchy which I do not like.,0
"I would like this more if it had more scrubbing beads and didn't smell like baby lotion. I won't buy it again, far too expensive to not love it.",1
"my hairstylist said to buy this as I was complaining about thinning hair... it was good for about one week. afterward my hair seemed to dry out and become very dull, no shine whatsoever. I was very sad and wanted to return this product but missed the return date by a few days. so what is left is down the drain with my money.",0
I have used Obsession perfume many times over my lifetime.  This perfume had a much darker amber color and I did not think the fragrance was the same.  It was just okay and maybe because I am 80 years old my sense of smell is not as good as it used to be!,0
"I would give this a 5 star review, but after buying a few of these, the nozzle eventually malfunctions everytime, not giving a nice even mist spray.  I now buy Evian water spray ... because the whole point of this buy it, is to have a smooth even mist.",0
I wish I had listened to other reviews about the smell of this product.  I order it anyway and immediately shipped it back without using it because of the overpowering smell of artificial lemon that reminded me so much of cleaning supplies. It's not that it's a BAD smell so much as that it is so STRONG.  I just was extremely hesitant to go around all day leaving the smell of artificial lemons in my wake.,0
I ordered this product two timea and recieved the wrong item both times! I received the Imperial Fiber Pomade. So now i have ti go out of my way to return both items.,0
It[s powder without an applicator and I think that's a ripoff. Why sell something that you cannot use without buying something else? You don't.,0
It arrived broken :(,0
Just ordered again.  Wife really likes the product,1
Nice nighttime moisturizer!,1
"It doesn't do anything. It sort of hardens in a way that makes it feel thicker, but only in that you can't get your hand through your hair without pulling out a bunch of it which is counterproductive. I stopped using it after about 6 months with no results.",0
Very glossy - not tacky. Love the color!,1
It doesn't seem to do anything for my hair.  Worthless product to me.,0
"I am a devotee of Bioelements and the only place I can buy it is on Amazon. This feels really good and it is the only product I have ever seen that claims to benefit the skin of us horrible, heathen smokers. H.H. smoking aside, I am blessed with moms great skin and this does seem to make it even better. Read recently that ""oxygen"" skin products do not do anything for your skin, but if I believed that every skin product was suddenly inefficient because, guess what, there is a new miracle product out to buy now, I would be out of a whole lot of ""works for me"" skin care products (and I am very choosy) AND I would probably have to re-finance the house to replace them. So I am sticking with this.",1
"I bought this thinking that I was going to get a full coverage glitter nail polish; from the way it looks in the bottle, that is what you would think. I was so excited when I got home to try it... when I put on the first coat I was very disappointed: hardly any glitter at all. It took FIVE coats to get the look I wanted. :(

If you are looking for full coverage glitter, check out Sally Hansen's new Gem Crush colors. Complete full coverage with 2 coats!",0
This cleanser leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean.  Absolutely love Bioelements products.,1
"I have used this product for over ten years. This seems to be the same product. I have seen comments that this may be outdated product, but I haven't had any issues.  This base covers well and lasts all day.",1
Very good,1
"Not crazy about the scent, but I like how it creams on the face. A little dab will do ya so it lasts a long time.",1
"Bought this for wicking my Rebuildable Drip Atomizers. Good stuff. This box should last me for years. Stop smoking, start vaping!",1
"After I tried it, I went ahead and bought the 10 oz. pump.  It stays by my front door.  It sinks into my skin fast, leaving it feeling better.",1
"Very pleased with this purchase. Shop confidently, this is genuine product in great condition. Packaging was perfect and cologne smelled exactly as it should. This was identical to what I would have purchased at a department store for 30-50% more. You can't beat saving money for a product and it coming directly to your door in 2 days. Will def buy fragrance from Amazon again! As for this particular cologne, it smells great:) I wanted to get my boyfriend something new for Valentines.... he's worn Aqua di Gio since HS, and it smells like every. high school. guy. ever! This is sophisticated, sexy, and adult. It's not terribly strong (you won't smell it across a room, or from more than a couple feet away), but fragrances that strong are too much anyway, and offensive to coworkers. This is something you notice when you get close, and I can still smell it on him at the end of the day:)",1
WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT AT ALL,0
Rather thin and no loop to hang it to dry.  You can get better products for less at Walmart.,0
Too heavy for my hair.,0
leaves a greasy residue,0
"This wash is remarkably gentle on the sensitive skin on my chest and neck and clears up any breakouts I have. I also use it on my back when the weather heats up. My only complaint, and the reason it gets four, not five, stars is that it doesn't smell heavenly. It's smell reminds me a bit of Breck Shampoo, if anyone remembers this one. :D Overall a great product.",1
Received this item today and it was marked NEW...This clearly was NOT new. Box was old as dirt and product wasn't even sealed. Def returning this.,0
Good Price,1
I like it and the smell.  It really does moisturize!,1
This has done nothing but make my hair dryer and frizzier.  I picked it because of the high ratings.  It's got a watery consistency.  There's no moisturizing quality to it that I've experienced.,0
i paid 50.00 for an empty bag with no products as shown!!????? really???,0
The color in the pic is not the color I received. Very disappointed:(,0
"I received the product just fine. The third time I tried to use it the applicator broke inside the tube.
I can't really use it now.",0
Love this!!!,1
Perfect color for me!!! Love it!! The most important I recieved New!!!!!,1
"I love that this is not tested on animals and made in the USA!  I also received this in my glossybox and I have to say, the formula is just terrible!  I don't think I've ever used a product that chipped so easily! Did not even get one day out of this before chipping.  Nice enough color and coverage...just a really terrible formula.  I expected a lot better from a domestic product that took a lot of care with the ingredients.  I'm sure it would have had a little more staying power with a topcoat, but with my other, more inexpensive nailpolishes (Essie, OPI, China Glaze) I still get a few days out of a polish without a top or base coat.",0
Great product at a great price. Will Buy again.,1
"I bought two sets of these for my boyfriend and a coworker. Both of them love it! They smell amazing and do not irritate the skin. I even tried the face wash and moisturizer for myself. It is light and not greasy. The set of 3 come in a small black satchel which is nice. They also make a travel size one, but I would recommend getting the full sized set, because it will go fast!",1
Thought I was going to love this ended up hating it and throwing it out. It made my face break out and smelt mildewy after two uses. I was expecting a reusable makeup wipe not just a pumped up washcloth,0
Excellent Scent for any occasion.,1
"This product has had mixed results. I definitely do not think it is worth it's price. You can find a cheaper product for 15-20 dollars that works just as well. However, it doesn't work that well.",0
"This barely has any power and does not hold a charge- it sounds like it's dying even after being on the charger.
Very disappointed in this clipper and for such a good brand.",0
Leaves hair feeling fresh.,1
"I have quite sensitive combination skin and LOVE this product.  It does not bother my skin at all and leaves my face clean and fresh.  I love the milky texture and the fruity scent.  A bottle also lasts a long time.  It is great value for me considering how many products I've bought and tossed after just a use or two because they left my face too oily, too dry and/or red and irritated.  Highly recommend.",1
Love it !,1
"I didn't like the smell, and it made my hair feel and look dry and brittle.",0
Did not stay on my nails,0
this is great nail polish. Like how easy to apply. Staying power is great. The color on my hands looks darker then on the picture. I thought it will be lighter and and more on the pinkish nude site. Still love it.,1
"Maybe I just got a bad or old batch, but this smelled sour when I received it. Returned!",0
"Not as hydrating as my husband had hoped for, smells good though!",0
Wear this on my xtreme eyelash extensions! amazing!!,1
"Product shipped very timely, babyliss straighteners are absolutely the best! I am very amazed this has made such a difference for my hair",1
Girlfriend loves it.,1
Build quality is terrible!  No match for my very thick hair! Iron gets so hot when I curl my hair the release thumb gaurd actually bent..... bent so much now it's unusable bc it won't open.  I've pushed it back up again several times but keep doing this and it will surely break off eventually. My conair I've had since high school has never done this to me and has always performed extremely well. Going back to the cheap drug store irons. And don't even get me started on hot tools blow dryers or flat irons. Joke and the biggest waste of my money! They simply can not stand up against my thick hair!!,0
"I'm of two minds about this product- I really like the matte (peach) but I'm less enthusiastic about the dewy (pink) side.

The matte side I have been using on the areas next to my nose, where I have large pores and roseacea. It blurs the pores nicely, but barely has enough tint to deal with some of the roseacea. It goes on smooth and silky, and almost instantly feels dry. I like that, having very oily skin in that area. It doesn't last all day, but it has a nice compact and is easy enough to deal with in the middle of the day. I've used it on clean skin and also over oil free sunscreen; it doesn't seem to matter. It works fine either way. I have not tried it over makeup yet but I think it should work fine, because the foundation I use is also oil free (silicon base like the sunscreen).

The dewy side I've used on my cheekbones and above my eyes and I have to be really careful not to use too much, because it stays a little sticky if I use even a hair too much, and that drives me batty. Used very sparingly, though, it creates a nice, fresh, look.

Neither side has made me break out, and I break out if I put anything remotely oily on my skin.

I think this is a really nice product if you have break through in oily areas of your skin, because it's easy to carry and super easy to apply.",1
Cleans wonderfully,1
This stuff is great for curly or frizzy hair. Doesn't weigh hair down or make too greasy. Both myself and husband use it!,1
"Love the colors and staying-power of this eyeshadow palette, but there's something in the ingredients that causes my eyes to get really itchy and painful every time I use it, and I don't usually have issues with sensitivity to eye makeup products.  I hate that I spent so much on a product that I can't even use.  Maybe Stila will use more hypoallergenic ingredients in the future, but for now, this is money in the trash.",0
"I owned the blue lotion before from s beauty box because it's small and convenient to fit in a small purse and most importantly it gets the job done with a nice but not overpowering smell. The hand scrub? Meh..:it was okay, hence the 4 stars",1
"I bought this because i had breast cancer and did not want any chemicals on my face, but this does have alum in it.",1
"Clearly the best antioxidant face cream with SPF in it!  I have been using this product for more than ten years .  It is non greasy, absorbs into skin, perfect for under your foundation.  Keeps skin looking healthy with a rosy glow!",1
Does remove the puffiness but not immediately. Is a nice cream,1
"This oil is so-o-o good, both on the hair and the skin.  The fragrance of this oil is outstanding.  It truly is a delight to have it again.",1
"I love this moisturizer.  I have very sensitive skin and had just about given up on finding any skin care products with anti aging ingredients that my skin could actually tolerate.  I have been using the LRP Toleraine series for more than a year with mediocre results.  My skin was just not improving on this regimen so I decided to search for something else.  I didn't know about the Redermic line, which is specifically for sensitive skin, until I saw it in the store.  This formula also has SPF 25 which is a very good thing as well.  It also has hyaluronic acid and vitamin C, two very good anti aging ingredients.  My skin is somewhat oily but this moisturizer soaks right in within 10 minutes and makes a great base for my makeup.  I also use the Redermic UV eye cream, which is also awesome.  Now I feel like I'm doing something great for my hyper sensitive skin.  And I should just mention that I haven't had a reaction at all to these products.  Toleraine may have kept my skin hydrated, but it didn't make it better whatsoever.  I've been using Redermic UV for about a month and I can already see that my lines and creases are softer and I'm sure with continued use, they'll look even better.  I wish I had known about this a year ago.  I also use the Exuviance Non Acid Peel at night, which is specifically for sensitive skin.  It uses sugar enzymes rather than acid to exfoliate and I'm really pleased with it as well.  I'm completely off my prescription cream and these products are improving my skin tone daily.  If you're extra sensitive like I am, you can definitely use these products.  If they work for me, they'll work for any sensitive individual.  I've lost ground over the last year but hopefully, I can gain something back by using these products.  I highly recommend the Redermic UV moisturizer and eye cream as well as the Exuviance Non Acid Peel.  All three are terrific.",1
"I take back my original review after using this product consistently for over a month a started to break out bad. To eliminate other variables I only switched moisturizers and I stopped developing these large painful zits. This product contains an Algae extract which are stated to be very commondonic. My skin just didn't respond well to this moisturizer, but many others have had no problems so take a risk and see for yourself.",0
"I had a small sample tube of this that I loved and found a great deal on here for a big bottle so I got it. I still like the scent, but this sprays more than the little sample did so it makes it much stronger. This is definitely a scent I need to spray in the air and walk through, as opposed to spraying directly on, otherwise it's just too strong. I used to have the original Euphoria and I have Euphoria blossom as well which is nice.",1
"Alittle heavy,but it is awesome.",1
"I was really excited to try this top coat, but it was incredibly disappointing.  I used it a few times and then got rid of it.  It does not leave a glossy or shiny finish on my nails, but rather makes the polish look dull.  I also found that it chipped really easily, and so I would have to redo my nails rather quickly, like the next day.  Even if this top coat was cheap (which is wasn't) I still would not recommend it.  In my opinion, Seche Vite is much more effective and longer lasting.  Even the drug store brand top coats are better than OPI.",0
Don't like the smell,0
I bought this at the Sephora store. My god was I blown away by the natural ingredients advertisement. After a week my face broke out in a rash!!!! Do a skin test before trying on face!!!!!,0
"I have purchased this product due to the fact that it has some natural/organic ingredients that I hoped would not irritate my skin.  Unfortunately, it made me brake-out without any improvements over a three week period.  Since it's not suitable for my face,  I use it as a neck moisturizer just to use it up.",0
Colors and texture are much different than i expected. The color is too light and the texture is too thin.,0
"Liked:  got a lot for the money

Lotion lacked enough moisture-it was too dry",0
Only lip balm I have ever used that actually works!,1
"Nothing about this smells like honey mint. The smell was so unexpected and Vaseline-like, I questioned the authenticity of my particular tube. I bought it thinking it would add a pleasant scent to my hair. Total fail in that arena.",0
Does not cover my age spots.  Very upset at the price I paid.  They show impossible things covered with this make up and it won't even cover an age spot.,0
I like the use of this Baxter Body Wash. It lathers well and feels good on my skin. I did not feel itchy after the use of this product. A good use and I would use again.,1
"I've always been told that candles need to be burned an hour for every inch of width in diameter, in order to completely liquify the entire top layer....  I let this candle burn for the suggested amount of time (even longer) and it melted a hole in the center.... boo.... such a waste.  Also, the fragrance isn't very strong, and what you can smell is quite mediciney....",0
I really like this shaving soap. Lubricates and cushions and leaves skin feeling tingly. Will keep buying it.,1
"To me, it smells like cotton candy. Much sweeter than I was looking for.",0
"Hi,

I've tried a lot of shampoos (including all-naturals) in my day and while my hair may feel and smell good, I've found that 95% of them leave my scalp dry and itchy, even with conditioning.  I came across this shampoo in a salon/ salon supply store and bought both the shampoo and conditioner and have found it to be the BEST shampoo I've ever used.  With no sodium laurel/laureth sulfate, yucca, germanium, wild mint and 100% vegan, it give my hair great body a nice tingle to my scalp that prompted me to buy this online when I couldn't find it in the store where I originally purchased it.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Abba-Pure-Moisture-Shampoo-8-45oz/dp/B001E0W5RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Abba Pure Moisture Shampoo 8.45oz</a>

"Pretty good for kipping acne at bay. I get very tingly-border line uncomfortable sensation when putting cream on top of this toner, though.",1
The best I can say about this produce is that it smells good.  Didn't really add any volume.,0
Good wearability,1
Very heavy.  I ended up buying a new hair dryer at Target within a few months that I was much happier with.,0
"amazing smelling cologne, definitely in the top ten and can compete with much higher priced colognes",1
"I hate the color, looks nothing like it did when advertised.",0
"I am a devout user of this stuff and simply refuse to use anything else. The oil is light but moisturizing. Helps my hair dry faster and helps tame any crazy frizz or flyaways. Smells amazing too. Diverse enough to use on wet or dry hair, and for any excess can be used on skin. Waste not! One of my hair product staples.",1
"Really good hold, but like you know hard to wash out. I like it.",1
Does a good job protecting hair color in the sun.,1
"I was looking for a facial sunscreen that did not make me breakout.  While I didn't breakout (for the two days I wore this), I also didn't like the feel of this product on my face.  My dermatologist recommended a sunscreen called vanicream that they sell at Walgreens that fits the bill.",0
"Father here.  From day 1 I would put this on my little girl after her bath, and although she was fine, my hands would itch like crazy.  I stopped using it, but my wife continued.  Tonight we ran out of the other lotion I had been using, went back to this for another try, and within 2 minutes my hands felt like they were on fire.  Upon closer inspection of my palm, I had very tiny hives which were impossible to sooth.  A few minutes under hot water and some neutral hand lotion, and my hands feel perfectly fine again.

Very happy it was me and not her, but I can't imagine a baby being allergic to this and not being able to tell anyone.  Be careful.",0
"Not in a very effective spray bottle. Actually poured it into an empty bottle of a different facial spray with a better mister.  This one kind of splats a small area with a lot of spray instead of a wider, even spray.",1
I bought it for my boyfriend as a birthday present and he likes it. I got the travel size bottle so he could try it out and see how he felt about it without buying a huge expensive bottle. So far he likes it but not enough for how much it cost.,1
product came shaken up,0
"I thought I finally found something that would calm my skin but instead, I broke out with redness, huge bumps and scabs after! Horrible!",0
The product has a weird smell which is different from one ones sold in the shops. Threwn it away because it feels weird on my face.,0
"The idea of the lash curler was great but turned very dangerous.  The first couple weeks this curler worked fantastic, especially for the outer corner lashes.  But one day it snapped as I was using it and it nearly damaged my eye.  I had read a review cautioning users that it could break if squeezed too hard, so I was very careful...CAUTION it can BREAK even if you are being very careful and squeezing mildly.  I wish they made this in a metal version, it would be ideal and much safer than plastic.",0
"My lips are kind of dark so the color doesn't come through well, but it adds a healthy pink tint. I love the design and so does my 2 year old cousin. The texture is moist and the gloss smells so fruity. I use it as more of a lip balm than a gloss.",1
"I bought this soap to get rid of my brown spots, well I been using it for about 4 months I don't see a difference. However, even though I have dry skin I was having issues with some pimples showing up around my chin all the time. Thanks to PCA they are gone! So I am giving 3 stars because it didn't work on the spots.",0
"I guess it works, since my issues decreased since I've been using the product",1
"I am looking forward to trying this mascara.  Green mascara is hard to find.  I was pleased at how fast it was shipped.  If I like the color, I will order several l,more.",1
I don't think this product did anything to improve the quality of my hair.  not worth the money; would not repurchase,0
"Solid, heavy, well made and nice looking. This is pretty subjective, but in my mind the synthetic bristles are more comfortable and smell better than badger. However it doesn't seem to lather up as nicely as even a mid range badger brush. I consider it a fair trade off and will keep using it. But no way it needed to be this expensive. I'm zapping you star for that, Jack Black.

If I bother writing a review, I try to include something that hasn't been said yet. In addition to be being very bottom heavy, this brush is wide. It it doesn't sit easily in the standard stainless-type brush holder I keep on my sink. In fact, when upside down it becomes so top heavy it wants to tip over. Here's what you do: get some clear rubber bands of the kind they sell for braiding hair and wrap a couple on the stainless prongs of the brush holder. This will protect the handle, grip better, and if you experiment with placement, stop it from wanting to tip over. You could also get a couple short pieces of clear tubing, but I did the rubber bands.",1
"Was given as a gift, and the recipient really enjoyed it.  Said the scents lasted and were pleasant.  She also liked the little case it was in.",1
"Like the hair spray, however every can stopped spraying before can was 3/4 way empty. Very disappointing.",0
I saw NO CHANGE at all.  I am very disappointed.,0
Wonderful product. It leaves me skin smooth and smells wonderful.,1
"My hot tool curling iron is perfect! It works really good, the size i wanted and i get alot of compliments on my hair.",1
I have deep dark circles. I got to know about this product from my dermatologist office. I was hoping to remove my panda eyes like dark circles with this pricey stuff. But i am not happy with the product.in one line IT DOES NOT REMOVE DARK CIRCLES as it claimes. Please don't get carried away by the anonymous positive reviews here like i was. You are paying alot for this small bottle which doesnt help . Its light in weight and no smell.,0
I don't know why they don't make a bigger size but this doesn't work as well as I expected.,1
"This dedoant is perfect with keeping you dry,However for long wear you may need to apply a deodorant to prevent gettting any odor. Overall good product. Would purchase again.",1
All I can say is don't waste your money on this product.  I have short hair and it is absolutely useless.  Just a big waste of money.,0
very juicy still smells good though,0
"We love this spray and can't get the fine, tangled hair brushed without it.  It makes the hair nice and shiny and doesn't leave it greasy feeling like most detangling sprays.  I  also don't the new fragrance.",1
great everyday cologne. It does get a bit rosey through the day I'm not saying it's feminine I'm just saying you will smell some roses as it settles on the skin. A solid cologne that will not offend but I moved on from it I just like the smell of polo black better.,1
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT !! If you are a sunscreen freak out like I am this is your product. Try it. You will never use anything else again. EVER,1
Requires very little lotion to achieve amazing soft skin results with a delightful fragrance.,1
the product i recieved is very diluted!! pretty upsetting because the product washes out of your hair alot faster because its not at its usual strength i notice the hair straightener burns it up aswell.  The original product will come in a dark orange color and the stuff i bought had so much water in it its more of a pale yellow color,0
Makes me skin SO SOFT!  I use it as a shaving cream too.  Love it and great smell!,1
I have now used nectifirm for 15 weeks twice daily.  No visible difference in my neck.  Sagging and wrinkles just the same..  Another $45 down the drain!  Ripped off again!  When will I learn?  No creme can fix wrinkles and sagging.,0
Seriously a total waste of money. Vinylux chipped within 24 HOURS! Worse than regular polish. Don't waste your money on this,0
Awesome!,1
This blow dry hair has great power and gets nice and hot,1
"Does nothing ----
Boy that ticks me off, they spend so much money in advertising to cheat people.
If you want something that really works go to your doctor or dermatologist",0
I have been asked where I found this lipstick multiple times. Great buy.,1
"You may feel that the price of this shampoo is too high--you'd be wrong. It only takes a bit of product to get great suds and you'll find a bottle will last much longer than less expensive products.  It has a pleasant, subtle scent and will leave your hair soft and clean.  I highly recommend this shampoo.",1
I normally love L'Occitane products but I cant say I love this one. Did not like the smell and felt it did not lather enough for me.,0
worked as intended,1
"This product did make my hair look less greasy. However, it has such a strong, cloying chemical odor that I ended up washing it out after a couple of hours. Kind of defeats the purpose of a dry shampoo.",0
Dosent break me out or make me oily.  Expensive,1
"I have been using the Jack Black Face Moisturizer with SPF 20 for over a month now. I pump the bottle five times into my hand and use half for each side of my face every morning. The lotion absorbs quickly and does protect my face from the sun. It smells slightly like baby powder but the smell goes away quickly. I'm not certain I will buy this product again once I run out but I will have no problem buying it if no other product fits my criteria: SPF, face lotion, won't burn my eyes if I sweat, designed for men, and has a neutral smell.",1
"This might work great for many but nothing special for me. Did not notice any difference when using this product.
Will not repurchase this item.",0
Worse hair oil ever.  DO NOT BUY IT.  THEY WILL NOT REFUND YOU THE MONEY.  JUST WASTE IT,0
Highly recommended!! Only problem: difficult to shave around the base of the nose area on the lip due to the large head.,1
I like it but the tube is less than half full,0
Pleasant light fragrance; absorbs readily; is effective at hydrating and softening.,1
New formula made me breakout everywhere!!! I used to use this as a toner and a refresher throughout the day but then the last bottle i bought made me get white heads and breakouts all over my face and parts of my neck/chest where the mist would land. I've never had skin issues and am thoroughly disappointed. I now have to waste time and money fuxing my skin to get it back to how it normally is. This product used to be amazing but is now not worth it anymore. So disappointing!,0
"I have owned several brushes over the years and have been a big fan or Proraso shaving soap so I figured I would like their brush.  It is much too stiff and the bristles dry in clumps.  Since it is a natural product you cannot expect perfection and given the price point, you get what you pay for.  I will use it for a while and ask for a better brush for Christmas.  I will continue to buy their soaps but will not recommend this brush.  Not the quality I would expect from Proraso.",0
I like the way it feels on my face and my make up goes on easier and lasts longer.,1
"I ordered this product in hopes it would allow me to build up my lashes and use the traditional Blinc mascara, but I think the primer I got must have been old and dried out. It is extremely clumpy, more so than old mascara, and makes my eyelashes very brittle when combined with the Blinc mascara. It seems to do minimally better with other mascaras. I would not recommend purchasing this product on Amazon. Stick with a vendor you know will send a new product.

If you want a buildable mascara, I think the Blinc Mascara Amplified does a better job than the primer + traditional Blinc.",0
"This is just  an average spray on product.  I have medium long hair, grey with blonde highlights.  Doesnt make my hair soft, silky or more manageable.",0
To dark for fair skin.,0
"Really does work. Great price, cheaper than getting though spa.",1
Great product! Helped to slow my hair loss.,0
"The body lotion works great, but the scent is really disagreeable. It reminds me of the spray underarm deodorants used in my junior high school locker room.  If La Roche Posay should come out with an unscented version, I would definitely recommend it. I purchased this through Amazon.com, but I attempted to place a review on their website(LP) as well, with the same number of stars and comments. The review didn't go through/was not shown on their website. There were 10 reviews to see, all 5 star reviews. Coincidence?",0
This product worked well on my friend so I bought some.  Tan Towel dried my skin and really didn't make my skin look brown. There are better products to self tan with out there.,0
"The bottle of Obsession arrived in a plain box with no lid to the bottle.
At first I thought there would be a second package with the lid and the original box. Not really the way I wanted to present it at Christmas.
I contacted the shipper ""Sams Online"" and was told this was the only one they had in inventory, so the shipped it ""As is"". I asked for a replacement and was told if I paid for shipment back to them , they would replace it. I don't feel that I should have to pay an additional cost to get what I already paid for.
Internet sales work only if the Vendor ships what they say they will; you are only as good as your reputation. Sams Online will no longer be someone I will deal with, and Amazon has lost a little of my respect. Sams has offered me a $6.00 credit, waiting for that to show up....",0
OPI is the best for traditional nail polishes and this Drip Dry is a must have and actually works! OMG...I'm almost out...time to reorder ASAP!,1
I bought this after reading so much about it on various boards. It never quite lived up to my expectations. I've used some products that seem to work overnight and this just wasn't one of them for me :(,0
"I should have listened to the reviews. The shampoo was like water and the conditioner smelled like hand cream.  This is a scam.

I have bought this brand from a salon and it is amazingly great!!  Whatever I got in the mail was not surface brand quality",0
"I have used this product for many years.  I love the sheerness of it.  It is not consistent getting it out of the container, but otherwise a great product.",1
The mouthwash is refreshing & the toothpaste leaves your teeth feeling smooth.  There was no noticeable difference after using the complete system.,0
Quick delivery. Works as expected,1
The iron is good and hits quickly but the hair dryer is not as fastest and powerful as a profesional dryer should be.,0
I apply every morning under my makeup.  Makeup goes on easier and fine lines look smoother - less noticeable.  Highly recommend!,1
"Outiside box was fine, but inside the bottle was in it's cylider, and iimpossible to get out. it was glued in or something. i had to cut the packaging & it was difficult to do to remove the bottle. the contents of the bottle were brownish looking. any fan of this product will know, as the picture shows, the contents should be clear! the smell was rancid! did not even closely smell like the real deal........smelled liked badly burnt sugar, not light cotton candy floral. this product cannot be returned, so i was totally scammed.",0
It is a nice solution to enhance my eyebrows.,1
"I have cystic, hormonal acne and I heard that Mario Badescu products work well. I purchased this and the Buffering Lotion and the Buffering Lotion works SO much better at reducing my acne than this does. This one is messy, application is weird (you have to apply it with a qtip or something else you can dip into the sediment at the bottom of the bottle) and the ingredients are essentially calamine lotion and alcohol. It also did nothing for my acne. I know this works for many people, so Im guessing it works better for white heads and smaller breakouts, however cystic acne tends to respond better to sulphur- based products (this is definitely true for me) and the Buffering Lotion is sulphur-based.",0
"I have only been using this for a few weeks; however I already see a difference in my skin. It looks and feels healthier and is so much smoother than it was before.

Also, I am super sensitive to a lot of ingredients and this doesn't break me out. I have the T-Zone skin type and I haven't noticed a problem with oil yet.

Best feature about this product is that It's all in one and blends perfectly with my skin tone. I would definitely recommend trying this. If you buy from Ulta or Sephora, you can return it for a full refund if you don't like it.",1
Thought I'd try the small bottle along with my skin cleanser from Elemis. So far I love it! I have combination skin and at age 48 I still get breakouts around my mouth and chin so I'm trying to keep my skin fresh and clean .,1
Made my lips very dry,0
"Powder is soft and easy to apply and coverage is good like 2 way foundation and does  need any liquid foundation before it. It does cover pores well.
It was a mirror but no sponge included.",1
allergic reaction be careful and how would you cover hair if you got none left to cover because of that product.,0
Love this polish! The color is a nice neutral and it wears forever!,1
I have used Floris Eau de Toilette before and the fragrance certainly didn't disappear on you in a few minutes! I agree with the other reviewers that these fragrances are knock off's and should be sold as such. I can't even return ii. This is the first time that I have been so dissatisfied with an Amazon purchase. I will not buy any fragrance from Amazon again.,0
great,1
Smells like a pool of water. I like it,1
"Covergae is good, but it dries out my skin",0
"Meh.  This lipstick-like tube is convenient to carry, but the Derma-blend quick-fix concealer goes on very thicky and the texture is thick and cakey.  Blending is essential.  After trying this, I think I'll stick to lighter, more fluid concealers.  35C Medium color is more pink in hue than I expected (compared to my usual reference of Bare Minerals' Medium Beige).",0
"Very good product, the first time to buy this product, looking forward to genuine",1
Very happy with the dryer but it must have come on horseback as it took almost 3 weeks to get here,1
Great job!  Easy to apply and covers well!,1
This was a nice hair dryer until it only blew cold air.  It lasted for 13 months.  Reliability does not match the $100 price tag.  I've used much less expensive dryers that lasted for years.,0
"Caused more damage/breakage (note: I have very fine, thin, straight hair that is very prone to damage). Glad I bought the trial size and didn't shell out for the larger size. My order was sold and fulfilled by Amazon (not a third party seller), so I'm confident I got the real product and not a knock-off. Definitely not worth the price.",0
I love OPI but this particular polish comes out very thick and clumpy. It streaked so bad that I had to remove it immediately. I would like to return this but it is not returnable.  Wish I never bought it.,0
"I think my skin is too sallow for this product as it makes me appear slightly jaundiced (not a good look!).  It's a nice smooth cream which glides on nicely, but definitely not for the sallow of skin.",0
1/2 the price of Sephora,1
fantastic,1
I wanted to love this brand because the product is amazing. Dissapointed with the shipment quality. I read other reviews and I should have listened to them. I got the conditioner with a broken cap (picture attached) and I also bought the shampoo which was significantly empty. The oz might be accurate but the bottle should be appropriately built then. Not worth it if for the price of the product unfortunately.,0
Love the color! Doesn't wear as well as some other brands.,1
developed itchy rash,0
Does not apply smoothly. Not impressed,0
"Great bronzer, not sure how water resistant it is, didn't try it out in the rain yet.",1
My Wife and daughters loved !,1
Best ever.  I am going to buy more of this product.,1
works as promised,1
"Hot tools was always a recommended product by hair professionals so I thought, ""why not?""!

I have a nume curling want which I LOVE, but it takes about 15-20 minutes to curl my hair. So I figured a curling iron would be a nice and quick curling fix. I can curl my hair with this curling iron in <10 minutes.. it's great! I have long hair and this is the perfect size for me. The results are wonderful... but I must say that my curls last longer with the nume curling wand. Curls with this will last one day, but won't look as great the next day. My curls with the nume curling wand still look great the next day.

Besides the curls not lasting as long, I have two other small complaints about the curling wand.
(1) The spring squeaks.. it came fresh out of the box and the spring ALREADY squeaks. I guess it's a little bit better since the package came with a replacement spring but it sort of confused me. Like it was a warning sigh that this is a commonly broken part. It hasn't broken yet (I've only had the product for about a month), but when it does I won't feel like replacing the spring.. even though they sent me an extra one... We will see how it holds up.
(2) The clamp thumb thingy, though covered in some sort of rubbery/silicone material, gets HOT. it's not unbearably hot, but it is noticeably hot.  There are four temperature settings on the iron, and I am set at the second coolest setting. I can't imagine how hot the clamp would get at max temperatures.... It's just odd because I have never encountered this problem with my previous curling irons.

If they were to fix these two things, it would be 5 stars. It's a great curling iron which produces wonderful curls, but it's not perfect. The extra day of curled hair would also be a plus.",1
"I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.

Over all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.",1
Not sure if it's original Kenneth Cole product or a rip off. Doesn't seem to have the same fragrance as the one's I purchased from Macy's.,0
This is a wonderful product. It smells great and as a balm it can't be beat. It is soothing to the skin after a shave. It is not sticky and the moisturizing effect lasts long after the product dries on the skin. Unfortunately the scent only lasts a short time but allows for an application of your favorite aftershave splash. I will definitely buy this (my new favorite ) again.,1
Was bought for a gift.  Recipient was thrilled.,1
Never been disappointed by the mont blanc brand. I got 3 variations of it and they serve me great!,1
"not bad, well, I mean you probably could find some cheaper products that does exactly the same for you, i just like the smell and maybe also a bit ---------the whole idea of fancy ness behind the brand",1
Night lotion is the best. I highly recommend it.,1
Love this for my guy!,1
It made my hair so stiff. I won't recommend :(,0
I found this too greasy for my fine but curly hair.,0
"I put this product on my baby's scalp and left it overnight just as the instructions said. After 5 applications in a row with each bath, there really was no difference. A gentle scrub with a toothbrush had the same effect.",0
just what expected,1
"I expected to be wowed after reading other people's reviews. It's a good mascara but I prefer they're real by benefit. Love the wand, the product itself doesn't seem anything out of this world though lmao",1
Wonderful!,1
Really upset when I got my conditioner in the mail today. The lid was not sealed and the container was broken. It sucks because this stuff is not cheap and you don't want any of it to be waisted.,0
"This does a nice job minimizing the occasional dark circles under my eyes. It blends and absorbs easily and is gentle on my sensitive skin. There is no greasy feeling and it stays in place all day. It has a flexible applicator that makes it easy to get the cream under my eyes, but I haven't been able to use it to blend it in all the way and still resort to finishing it off using my fingers.

I don't see much in the way of anti-aging as there are still fine lines in my skin. To be fair, I didn't expect any anti-aging miracles as I'm well beyond the ""early signs of aging"" and into the ""visible signs"" category. Rather, I was looking for a good, lightweight cream concealer to brighten up my eyes, and this does the job nicely.",1
"I burn easily, but no sunscreen felt light enough to use on my face.  This product is lightweight and non-greasy.  With the tint, I now use it instead of foundation.",1
Great for drawing fine lines and perfect color for dark brunettes.,1
I need another one sent to me. I opened up the envelope and the container was broken and spilled all over the inside. A huge mess. I have photos if you need to see them. I was very excited to try this product and this was very disappointing.,0
"The one time I used this cream it seemed to provide a close and smooth enough shave but I haven't been able to go back due to the overbearing scent of Proraso's Sandalwood product. Generally, I like sandalwood but this leaned far more towards powder/old-school barber shop smell. If the scent just washed away I might be OK with it but it REALLY lingers.

I have experience with a number of higher end shave creams from Murad, Anthony and Cremo and so far, for my money, the Cremo is a better product with a light citrus scents that washes away when done with the shave.

I truly wanted to like this product more.",0
Wife loves it!,1
"I first purchased this flat iron in 2010 and it lasted me up until a few months ago, when I tripped over some laundry and stepped right on the hinge, which snapped the iron in half. I've used a number of friend's straighteners in the last few months trying to find a less expensive replacement and none of them smooth my crazy curly, frizzy hair like this one does. I have long, thick curly hair and it only take me about 15 minute to get to pin straight locks with this bad boy. I did read in other reviews that some people are receiving knock-offs, but I bought mine through Prime from ""pia beaute"" and the flat iron is the real deal. I know it's a lot to pay for a straightener, but considering the previous one I owned lasted for 6 years (and probably way longer if I hadn't been such a klutz) I think it's worth the investment. Also - bonus, it comes with a four year manufacture's warranty against defects/breaking from normal use.",1
Love this product Used to get it through my plastic surgeon's office until they switched brands when this became available online. Works well and for me most importantly is not greasy at all. Use it for 6 weeks and you will notice a positive difference in skin quality.,1
"I have always had thin hair so this product is great for me. My hair definitely looks thicker where I part it. I didn't buy the applicator so it was a little harder to apply. This product is basically a power of little fibers that you put in your hair. It is easy to wash out. I would not sleep with it on because it can get on the pillow.

The picture is one with the product on the the second without the product.",1
"I like it so much, I realized I was rationing myself on how often to use it.  Like I was saving it for a special occasion, well, I got over that and use it all the time.  It's awesome.",1
"I use this all the time but my friend borrowed some over the summer and was shocked by how it's not greasy and doesn't smell like sunscreen. It's great in southern California sun, beaches, rock climbing, etc. I'm a pale redhead with a family history of skin cancer, so I swear by Elta MD. It's lightweight and non-stinky. Even my picky ""I hate sunscreen"" niece will let me put this on her face. It's pretty much everything good and nothing that  that your average sunscreen is hated for. Yes, it costs a lot, but dying of skin cancer is so much worse (seriously, it is).",1
"I'd recommend this product to anyone with fine or thin air.  It adds volume, and really makes a difference when I use it.",1
Continues to be my favorite.  Both of my boys have sensitive skin and mild Eczema and tolerate this lotion fine.  If their Eczema is at all flared up I don't use it on those areas.  I give this as part of my gifts to any new moms.,1
amazing product,1
"OPI DS Extravagance is a gorgeous color. I went online to look at pictures before buying this and read somewhere that this color didn't pop as well on darker skin tones as it does on lighter ones. I liked the color so much that I decided to try it anyway, and I'm glad I did. It looks beautiful! I always like to apply two coats of nail polish, and that's all I needed with Extravagance to get full coverage. I'm very happy with my purchase.",1
It smells so awful that I had to get up in the middle of the night to wash it off,0
leaves hair dry,0
Bad product without packing did not Last.,0
"Im not exactly sure what it is about this hair dryer, but I have never had such issues with knots in my hair while blow drying in my life. I brush my hair while blow drying it and it is knot after knot after knot. Same for my daughter. It also is very loud. I could not afford to get another T3 dryer so I thought this ion hair dryer would be just as good. NOPE. I guess you get what you pay for.",0
"Knock off, I bought it as a gift and girlfriend immediately could tell her real one from macys and this one were two different things.... I think she register it to someone lol",0
I love all Mustela products and this one is no different. It didn't dry my babys skin compared to some other brands that I tried. It does have a strong perfume (all mustela products do) so I can see how some people may not like it.,1
There is no question in my mind that this is a quality product. When you open the box the four products will look small for the price you paid. But if used correctly you need very little product and this will last you a very long time. Following the proper procedure will give you an excellent shave and experience. The pre-shave oil I feel is the most important step in the process; this and a good razor. I also like that I was able to use a unscented product. My only complaint is that for the price a higher quality brush should be included. It seems nice at first but is not of quality to last.,1
Great price and great flat iron!!!  One thing I noticed is that the temp will accidentally go up while flat ironing your hair.  The button gets depressed if you squeeze on the iron.  Almost lost a chunk of hair over this!!!,1
I tried this product and quit not long after.  It felt so heavy and greasy and my face shined like never before.  Even my Mary Kay Oil Mattifier couldn't overcome the shine.  It tastes bad and stings my eyes.  The only positive thing I can say about it is that my face didn't burn in the sun.  I'm back to using my Oil of Olay.,0
"This product does not last long enough to justify the price. Using only once a day, this item will not last a month.  Additionally, the application changes and becomes Splotchy as you get about halfway through the contents. Do not recommend",0
"Girls love this stuff, my 12 year old nieces love it, and it doesn't smell overwhelming even if its over sprayed!",1
"Four star, smells great, non -eye burning shampoo.",1
I have this same straightener purchased from a salon for my daughter and this one looks like it but does not work like it it's a cheap knock off,0
"Not impressed, in my opinion this is just average whitening toothpaste. Over the counter whitening  toothpaste does the same job for a lot less money.",0
"use this brush curler daily, this particular one is my spare....",1
"This straightener is terrible.  I was looking for something cheap and that's exactly what this product is.  It does not heat up very high.  I have thick hair, but previous straighteners (Revlons wet2dry and a Chi) were FAR FAR superior to this badly made product.  I, sadly, trusted the reviews and now regret it.",0
"I use this after my daily skin routine and throughout the day and it seriously does my skin wonders! I love it every once and a while because it's just so refreshing! I don't know how good it is over makeup, but it works great when you don't wear makup!",1
Smells great!,1
"The price was amazing, I'm very happy with this cologne. I wish I could say this was my unique scent but that's just not the case.",1
I like the color and stuff but I hate the application thingy its so hard to paint my nails with it cuz its kinda small and thick. I know its ok for it to he small so you can get all the nail and stuff but it was also thick so when I tried to get the side of my nail it would get the polish on the side of my finger idk its weird asf,0
This is not Neuma shampoo. I have purchased this from a salon before. This product looks completly different.,0
I love this product.  I do not like the new plastic tube.  I will order again but am sorry for the change.,1
"As described, Came on time...would order again.",1
"I was about to place another order for my usual Mac concealer and I thought I'd try Vincent Longo concealer first.
  First of all I really like  the way that it dispenses.  My Mac concealer had a pump type dispenser which was impossible to control the amount of product released,  and I ended up wasting nearly as much as I used.  With the VL twisting style dispenser you can get exactly the amount that you want with no waste.  I use my finger to retrieve the product from the sponge,  making sure my hands are very clean before touching the sponge.  (still I may use alcohol to clean it now and again...since sponges harbor bacteria)

For me this concealer works beautifully under my eyes.  It goes on smoothly,  covers well, and does not settle in my wrinkles.  I am slightly olive tone skin and the medium is absolutely the perfect color for me in winter.  (I'm pretty pale right now..)
I'd say it covers age spots about 80% and my mineral makeup does the rest well enough.  Not a hundred percent but close.

Vincent Longo Perfect Canvas Liquid Concealer is a winner in my book!
 As far as the price goes,  this product will probably last me over a year so I don't mind spending the money.

UPDATE: MAY 22, 2014:
I did like this product but it ran out very quickly compared to any of the other concealers I've ever tried.  It lasted nearly three months for me but that's not long enough.  Considering the price I would not purchase again.  I love the dispenser and I like the concealer,  but I used it up in no time compared to Mac even with Mac's  lousy wasteful dispenser.  I docked one star from my original review due to the fact that they don't give you enough but in fairness to the product,  if you don't mind buying it every three months, ... it's a good product.",1
"i suggest using this short term if you have temporary hair loss.  long term, i'd switch to a natural/organic shampoo/conditioner",1
"After using for two weeks, there is very little color. I am fair so I expected somewhat of a tan. It does leave your skin soft and has a nice smell.  Disappointed:(",0
"goes on lightly, and smells simply decadent. You only need to use a dime size worth.",1
i am finally happy with the jane idedale powder. other places i ordered from in the past i felt were fakes. but this IS the real one. :),1
love this shampoo,1
"These products will enhance the quality of your shaving results, and if you like to indulge, they also enhance the experience (textures, fragrance). The scent is fresh and not overpowering.

The products are a full size, so some of the older reviews may be referring to an older version of this set. These aren't economy-size jugs, but the sizes are accurately listed in the description.

So if you like to spend a lot on yourself, or on a gift for someone who appreciates luxurious grooming products, this is a good buy.

But of course you can also get a close comfortable shave at the drugstore, and not everyone wants a 3-step routine. If cost is an issue, don't feel like you're missing out if you pass on this.",1
Great stuff!!,1
"I do not see any miracles here, but the oil smells so nice and fresh, I just love it. It has fruity refreshing smell. Watermelon, I think, maybe some flowers, too. The smell is gentle and not strong and it goes away quickly so it is not going to interfere with your perfume if you use one. I just cannot get enough of it. It sprays nicely and absorbs into skin easily.
It did not really help with my really horribly dry patches, but made areas with more mildly dry skin softer and less dry.",1
"This is the best mouthwash ever. I'm on my third bottle, and I still love the taste and smell. It's concentrated, so I use a shot glass to mix it with spring water that I keep by the sink. It's a little bit of a hassle, but I can then mix it a bit stronger if I'm so inclined. I have a few other older bottles of mouthwash, and I really notice now that they aren't anywhere near as good as this.",1
Bought this after using a sample from my barber. All I asked was to make it look like the picture. Pretty close. No complaints thus far.,1
"I have Mediterranean coarse, wavy to curly hair which is not uniformly curly. I use this product for relaxing the top part of my hair and giving it a more pleasant bounce in line with the lower portion of my hair which is bouncy and wavy. Not only did this not ruin my hair like other things I've tried (both at the salon and at home), but it actually makes my hair softer and shinier. Although the instructions say it should not be used on previously relaxed hair, I have used the product 3 times on my hair (same parts of hair, not just new growth) for partial relaxation (not reaching the maximum amount of time recommended, and in the thin/sensitive version of the formula). It works like a charm, and not a single split hair to date! I have no idea how soy and mushroom extract can do that. Btw, no chemical stench or harsh chemicals. I only wish the bottles came with more volume indications (in 1/4, not just 1/2 size) so that one can safely mix smaller quantities if only small portions of hair are to be done (e.g. bangs) to avoid wasting the expensive product. I've ended up doing this on my own, writing with a pencil on the bottles, which does work.",1
"I LOVE Lorac cosmetics and this is a great set!  The pencil liner is probably the best pencil liner I've tried.  It actually stays in place and doesn't give me raccoon eyes by the end of the day.  The blush and shadows are fabulous as is the mascara.  The only item I didn't care for was the lipstick. The color was a beautiful nude shade, but it seems very thick and sticky.",1
My hairdresser gave me a sample pack of this. I tried it and loved how it made my hair feel. Try it! You will love it. This is my second bottle and I think I will always use it.,1
"I emailed the makers of Glycolix and inquired about the acetone and its usage, I was told it was safe so i used these for months and broke out HORRIBLY, pustules, papules, oily oily skin. They were just awful. I don't know what all these positive reviews are but I did not have anything positive about what happened to my face during the usage of this product.",0
Did not bond to hair as well as I expected . Recommend the use of a holding spray.,0
Didnt see any sort of difference. Left the product on for over two hours. Disappointed.,0
"Works great, makes doing beats lines sooo much easier than traditional shaving creams.",1
Impossible to achieve a smooth coat. Un- o.p.i.,0
"I wish this stuff weren't so expensive but I LOVE it.  It goes on with the feel of a makeup primer.  I wish the tinted version were 50 SPF, it's only 30.",1
Brought this for my girlfriend and I use it once in a while.  Its pretty thick and more on the creamy side.  The smell may not suit guys but my girlfriend swears by the effect of it!  Better for those with extra dry skin!,1
"I've been using this product for quite a while. Normally, I have to get it at a salon and pay the inflated price. This is about 1/3 off the salon price. And delivery is always a convenient plus",1
Flakes off,0
Bought because of the good reviews. It was different but I loved the fragrance. Will buy again.,1
"This is really good stuff, I love how soft it makes my hair feel.",1
"Has the formula changed?  I used to love this hand cream, but it's expensive so I don't buy it regularly.  I got some this past Christmas, and it's not working at all like it used to.  I don't think I'll get it again.",0
This stuff is great. I feel it's too expensive however. Probably would sell more at a lower price,1
I like it. it's refreshing. The rose scent is pleasing.,1
Glue takes off your own eyelashes even with baby oil or make up remover. Very very hard on your own lashes... Wouldn't recommend.,0
Had tried this in the store before buying it. It's a nice musky scent even for someone who prefers florals.,1
It's OK but I don't like the color,0
"Any SPF I use on my face usually bothers my eyes. This one, however, does not. It is light and does not cause breakouts. I recommend it for SPF use specifically.",1
This Saved Me From Having Unwanted Brassy Hair Due To Hard Water In A Temporary Housing Situatuon. The Weekly Treatment Is The Best!,1
Literally only lasted one cleaning of my brushes. And it didn't even clean them thoroughly.,0
"I had high hopes for this. I have been looking for 'the' topcoat to keep my polish from chipping. This is not it. On the second day of wear I get big pieces of polish breaking off. not just small chips but BIG pieces.  I even tried it with multiple polishes thinking it just didn't like the first one...nope. Then I tried it with Orly Bonder, as I saw suggested by someone. Nope.  Not only that byt it seemed to really make my nails damaged. Granted they are sorta thin and have a lot of ridges, but it seemed to make it worse.

Now granted I did not use this with the Vinylux polish. But the articles and reviews I read said you could use with other poilshes, which did not work for me.

didnt work for me burned my skin moving on from Mario Badescu tried multiple products nothing worked!,0
i thought it was darker not worth what i paid,0
Love the color,1
This color is beautiful!!,1
This was just strange. Ive worn Green Tea intense for about 15 years. First time orderinoff Amazon. I don't know who sends this particular batch but it smells NOTHING like EA Green Tea! Its nauseating. I don't know if they stuck a random smell in the green tea bottle or if its old or fake or what. Do not purchase from this seller. And it says I cant return it. So $$ down the drain since I have to now find Green Tea that actually smells like the perfume I love. Disappointed.  And confused as to how this happenes.,0
I personally do not like this product.  I have extremely thick highlighted blonde hair.  There's not much you can put on my hair to make it greasy when styling it but this manages to leave my hair greasy and sticky.,0
"Great, do you also have a spray on?",1
I still had a lot of acne around my nose.  This product did not work for me and it did not remove all of my makeup.,0
Great color but pen dries up within a week. I have bought this twice and both times it didn't last . Dont waste your money!,0
"A bit pricey, but I feel good knowing there are any harmful ingredients in something I put on my face every day. It can go on a bit opaque at first, so be warned.",1
Love this stuff!  Used it at a nail salon and fell in love with the feel and smell.  I'm incredibly picky about hand lotion and this stuff does not seem to have that weird sticky feeling that most get.,1
It doesn't cover well,0
"I really like this color - however, it had a slightly more orange undertone than blue undertone (which I normally prefer) it wasn't enough to detract from the look, but the swish of color online seemed more like what I would have preferred. I suppose I will trust the outer tube  color next time, or try it in person before purchasing online. Normally I only use Vaseline, but after trying this product I am sold on lip stain!",1
I've used Rusk equipment products and the hold up forever.  I had my last Rusk Iron for 10 years.,1
Great face wash that doesn't dry your skin out.,1
"This shaving cream is smooth, creamy, provides a great shave and smells great!  Highly recommend and a great addition to Musco Real's line of products!",1
"Excellent product for thick, curly hair.  My nine-year-old daughter loves this stuff.",1
"Didnt love this. It was cool upon application, but did not penetrate overnight. I woke up with a film under my eyes that was gooey and clumpy.",0
I love this whole line of products. I've been using them for a little over two years now and think they're awesome.,1
Very heavily scented. Dislike the smell.,0
Love this stuff!,1
Love this liquid eyeliner.  Stays in place but comes off easily water and little pressure/rubbing and my normal face cleanser.  No makeup remover needed but stays on during day and with tears.,1
"Unfortunately this is extremely strongly scented. Smells like very fragrant sunscreen. The smell is irritating and was completely surprised that it was not unscented or naturally scented with a non irritating smell. Money lost because we can't use it on our 6 month old. Her skin is very irritated now and I don't want to risk it. Plus it makes me sneeze! Not recommended if you are looking for a hypoallergenic, healing lotion.",0
It leaves a gross feeling film over your teeth,0
I first bought this at my dermatologists office to help with sun spots. I can say that it has naked a difference! Just make sure you use it twice a day and wear sunscreen of course! It is a gel formulation. I would recommend this product!,1
"I said this in my review for the buffering lotion but I'll say it here again : I've been fighting acne for many years and as you can imagine tried a lot of different products on the market. This is one product that I can confidently recommend to other people saying ""it actually works"".  I usually use it in combination with the Buffering lotion (first buffer then dry), and this combination has worked very well for me!

The drying lotion is actually stronger than the buffering lotion. I only apply it as a spot treatment. For those ones where you can see the white head, it will shrink overnight. For those deeper acnes, it helps to control them well, but those take a few days to go away

It does stink a little on some on the acnes I that apply to, and in the morning I can clearly see the acne being dried, so I'd avoid sensitive areas with this product, mostly just around the eyes.",1
"This is my second BaByliss blowdryer.  The first one I had lasted more than 3 years and while it still was working  I wanted to treat myself to a new one.  I love the different heat settings, it is light and gives off a lot of air and dries your  hair quickly.  The price is great and I am confident I will get the same amount of use as I did with my original one. I am so satisfied and I would highly recommend it to anyone!",1
Really light effect.  This only gets rid of the puffiness.,0
just beautiful!,1
nice product but irritating eyes...,1
I've only been using this for a month. I use it once a week to replace my regular shampoo and do notice that my hair does see more clean and oily after using it. I feel it is too early to tell still but seems okay so far.,1
"Not impressed with this product.  For the money I thought it would be much better than my cheap Revlon. Instead it barely dries , and struggles and squeals to get through my very thin hair.",0
Was extremely excited of receiving this perfume. I smell notes of pine and that's about it. No one around me smells anything. Would not buy again.,0
Even better than expected. I found this soap in a 5 star hotel and I usually don't care for this stuff but if was so good for my sensitive skin (even Dove sensitive skin dries me out). I'm sure I'm an exception but it still leaves me a little dry and I put lotion but if I forget to put lotion (it happens) it's not unbearable. Highly recommended.,1
My esthetician recommended pca line products so I chose this one.  I hate the smell and this is no better than other  cleansers.  Md formulation and revision make great facial cleansers,0
I've used several Avene products and been very pleased with them so I was really disappointed to find the sunscreen heavy and left a greasy feel on my face,0
It is not dispensing after 2nd time of use. Other than that the product is fine. I love the fact that it moisturized my very dry hair within leaving a greasy look on the scalp. MAY buy again!,1
"I had such high hopes. I don't see how this cream can be considered a peeling cream. It smells great, dries like a mask but I don't see any peeling or skin turnover and I'm using it regularly. Pretty high price for something that just smells good.",0
This product does not smell like the product my stylist uses!  It cannot be the dame.,0
"I'm not a big grooming sort of guy. I use two-in-one shampoo/conditioner. I've even used the all in one body wash-shampoo-conditioner. I don't know what the difference of all that stuff is.

But, as I get older, I find that I want to take care of my face more and more. Like I don't usually wear sunscreen because I don't burn and don't really get a lot of exposure to the sun (like I'm not close to a beach. I live in south Texas where you literally melt in the summer heat so A/C and being indoors is your friend). Anyway, I felt like I needed to step up my game and someone suggested this product.

It's pricey AF. But it does have SPF 20 w/ the moisturizer so that's good I suppose. And, you don't need to use a lot so even with daily use it has lasted a long time. I don't know if it's improved my complexion or tightened or whatever other magics these things are supposed to do, but I do know that I don't have super dry skin out of the shower in the mornings anymore.

But to be honest, I suspect cheaper products would do similar things likely with harsher chemicals or whatever.",1
This made my hair feel like hay.....not impressed.  I thought this would help brighten my natural light blonde hair but all it did was make it feel dry and yucky.,0
Very thick.,0
I'm glad to discover this product. It goes on smoothly and you barely notice it's there. Seems to do the job!,1
No seal on the product! I bought this in at the end of April received it may and had a salon treatment so I haven't used this product my fault for not looking at the bottle right away! it is now the beginning of August and I wanted to use the at home product since my hair is now feeling very dry from the summer sun and heat styling ! Well low and behold I went to open and realized that the bottle does not have a seal! I do not feel comfortable using this product since it is not sealed and i am well past my return window. :(,0
"I was so dissapointed with this smudge pot! It was about five days after I bought the product that the whole pot dried out. At first it went on really smooth but after it dried out it turned into a chalky mess that flaked off so easily! I tried to take out the dry eyeliner on top and get to a more smooth liner on the bottom but the whole thing was just a big mess. Even when it went on smooth after I first purchased it, I had to put matte black eyeshadow over the liner to make the shade darker. Don't waste your money. Try MAC Fluid Line or Clinique Brush On Liner instead.",0
"What has happened to this product? My skin esthetician recommended Replenix Neckleage 6 months ago and I loved it. The lavender fragrance was lovely and every use was like a spa treatment. The results were amazing! However, when I ordered on-line, the product I received had a terrible fragrance  similar to a bad chemical smell. I sent it back, waited a month thinking maybe I had gotten a bad batch. The new jar just arrived and it has the same icky smell. This product is expensive and I do not feel comfortable putting something that distasteful on my delicate skin. So disappointed.",0
I wouldn't buy this brush again. Looks amazing but doesn't do it's job. When parting or pulling hair from one side to another it does a horrible job. I prefer my cheap old brush over this one and actually don't use this brush at all,0
This is pretty heavy for a mousse-it makes my hair look oily. Might be good for someone with extremely frizzy hair.,0
I don't love loccitane. Its ok but it is very over priced. I will not be reordering.,0
"This makes me feel good using it. The first time I used it it left my skin with a light shimmer which I liked which lead me to buy the full size version. Been using it ever since but I don't see the difference in my skin. Gave it a 4 because I feel special using it, it's a small treat for yourself, gives you a spa feel in the shower, to me, that's worth it.",1
"Initially I adore this scent, it's so light and perfect, but within an hour or two the scent has faded away unlike my other perfumes.  Not sure what the deal is on this.  Should be cheaper if it's not going to last.",0
"Haven't noticed a difference yet.  Should have expected that.  I don't smoke, drink coffee, or wine.  Don't buy, just go get your teeth done by a professional.  Once you waste all the money on these pastes and white strips and bla bla bla you could have just had a dentist do them.",0
"Good product for dry hair. But I liked Rene Furterer Karite Intense Nourishing Condition even more, or you could mix the 2 together and I really liked that.",1
"This product, as purchased, was nothing like the one purchased at a L'Occitane store.  The scent was different and the consistency was different.  This one is more liquidy whereas the one purchased from the store was more creamy...thicker.  One wonders if it is a counterfeit product.",0
"Great for sensitive skin, lathers well",1
"I love the product, but the shipping was atrocious. The shampoo leaked all over. Compensation would be in order.

Thank you,
Maureen Hebert",0
Good,1
"I have white hair, and in recent years all my body hair has been turning white as well. I get tired of gently pencilling in brows that don't last (tip: for realistic brows, try using a #2 pencil instead of brow liner, if your hair is gray or white). The ""blinc"" brow mousse takes a bit of practice, but it works, and doesn't smudge. Dark brunette is too dark for me, but the lighter shade wasn't available, so I brush it on very lightly. As the instructions state, start light and build up to the color you want; if you put it on too dark, you have to remove it entirely & start over. It's an okay solution, and cheaper than having brows dyed. I dyed my brows myself for a while, but it's a long, tedious process, and frequently was too dark for the first few days.",1
"i purchased this roller set after borrowing a  T 3 set from a friend for a vacation.  her set was for short hair, and contained (8) 1 1/2 inch rollers.  they heat rapidly when properly placed on the heating pins and gave me a lot of volume which lasted for days.  i have long hair, so when i returned home i purchased the set for long hair.  i like the result, but i hate putting them in.  the long hair set contains 4 inch and a half rollers and 4 inch and 3/4 rollers.  the clips barely fit the smaller roller, but do not fit around the large ones at all.  i spent $20+ dollars for two more of the smaller rollers.  but i still have a terrible time getting them to stay in for the 20 minutes i need to get the set i want.  they literally fall out on the floor.  i thought i would get better at it over time, but the clips just don't contact enough of my scalp to hold the roller.  for my money, the inch and 3/4 size need much larger clips.  i can't see anyone but someone with hip length, thick hair needing rollers that large, and then i still don't think the clips would hold the roller.  all and all, i am quite frustrated and disappointed in this (not inexpensive) set of rollers and i think i'm about ready to go back to my decade old, much cheaper set.  the problem is that i do like the volume i get with the velvet type roller.  the old, knobby ones give me too much actual curl.  i don't think there's anything else out there now, so i just put them back in when they fall out and swear a lot.",0
"I have to agree with the other user that said this product does not last more than a day, I had rather high hopes of this product as it is not cheap and it is supposed to have less harmful ingredients and even a more natural strengthener component. But it made my nail polish act as a peel off polish...I was literally able to peel all of my nail polish right off after about 4-5 hours of it drying. For the price I paid I will just have to use it for the treatment part.",0
Wouldnt spray,0
"Definitely seems to be whitening my teeth better than the whitening strips and, yes, it does work on crowns and bonding. The others don't.",1
"It is a great cologne but way, way to expensive.
Triple the amount it actually costs!",0
So far I have had no problems with this shower head. I do feel it has been beneficial for my hair.,1
"The wear on this shade is not as great as some of the others I have used from this brand, I'd recommend sticking to the lighter ones, it's pretty messy too and the whole idea behind this type of lipstick is to stay put!",0
"This is a light foundation that blends easily and provides good sun protection.
This is not a heavy foundation and does not look like ""pancake"" when you go
out in the sun. It's light and feels good. My dermatologist recommended it after
facial laser procedure and it's great.",1
I use this cream in the summer since it is a bit lighter then most night creams plus my skin is more distressed in the summer.,1
"This item worked for me, but everyone's chemistry is different -- Give it a chance to work, nothing is an immediate cure-all -- Unlike the ""Snake-Oil"" sales pitches you hear for these popular acne systems out there [and you know who they are] -- Trial and error is an unfortunate part of acne -- Give it time to work, be sure to switch off/on with other products to avoid building up a tolerance to this or any product you may choose --",1
"Not good. It didn't do anything, especially the scrub. It's like adding a layer of wax to your lips that can barely be washed off. Disappointment.",0
I've had this facial brush for roughly 4 and a half months and it just stopped working. Won't hold a charge to save a life. Nothing happy at all,0
Worked fantastic!!,1
"This is my new go-to moisturizer for face - I used the Eucerin Daily Defense for years, but switched to this when I learned that Eucerin had some comedogenic ingredients in it. This product is more moisturizing than the Eucerin, smells better, and has a thicker texture. (I have sensitive, acne-prone skin.)  It's not too heavy, but definitely adds moisture to your face, and it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, even on my eyelids. It has a very light fragrance that smells like magnolias when you put it on, but that fades and isn't noticeable during the day. (Just a warning - the SPF 17 version has a totally different ingredient list, so I can only vouch for the SPF 30). The bottle I received from Amazon is identical to the ones at my local Ulta and has felt just the same on my skin, so it's a genuine product as far as I can tell. I think my only issue is the packaging - you have to be careful not to let product get stuck in the little flip top tube, as it will dry out and you'll end up wasting it (or trying to rub dried-out product onto your face early in the morning). I usually just tap the bottle on the counter a few times before flipping the lid shut, and this seems to keep it pretty clear.",1
Pink sugar is pink sugar------however the hair perfume does not last that long. I feel like I have to use the spray often. I recommend using it along with the perfume as well if you want the scent to linger.,1
"I accidentally ordered these without realizing that they eliminated ingrown hairs.  Days after shaving, I noticed I didn't have any ingrown hairs after a while.  Usually at least one or two, even when shaving with the grain.",1
"I am very disturbed that upon receiving this hair cream from amazon, there is an extra label on it which states ""WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer."" WHAT?? And its being knowingly sold this way? I have contacted Rusk to find out which chemical it is so I can know what to avoid in other products. I'm SO sad because I have been using this product for years (which makes me nervous now) and it has been my favorite hair product. I hate that I have to now go hunting for something else that works for my frizzy hair but a-hunting I must go.",0
"Not at all impressed by this flat iron.. I like the size and that's pretty much it. I bought it to use until I was ready to splurge on the full size, but I didn't realize there is no temperature control on the iron. That's not appealing. Additionally, my hair is natural, aka not chemically processed, so I was looking for something to straighten my curl with one pass. Unfortunately this iron does not do that. And my edges are somewhat short, so I thought that due to the small size of the plates, the iron would be good for my edges but that is not the case. Had I not missed my window to return, it would be headed back to Amazon as we speak. Save your money..",0
"This stuff is great, leave hair feeling very clean, its good for your scalp, it keeps bugs away when working outside, also gives you a clean feeling you just do not get from other shampoos.",1
Wonderful smell and a little bit goes a long way.  Even people who do not like perfume can enjoy.,1

I have negative experience with item: is that device doesn't have  same power and effectivity than before. I'm really disappointed.,0
"The color was perfect for me, I loved the precision of the wand when delivering product to the brow BUT it is a very messy product. Brown brow product had fallen all over my hands, under my eyes and the sink.",0
"I don't have sensitive skin and, even if I did, this is designed not to irritate excessively.  My skin barely pinked up when using this for the indicated 10 minutes before rinsing, but it did feel nicely smooth and clean.

I've used this for 3 weeks now and suspect that that's not long enough to notice any lightening of skin hyperpigmentation.  I have one age spot on the side of my nose that I always use as a test when trying out new skin products that claim to even out skin tone and get rid of age or sun spots.  So far that spot of mine is hanging in there, looking like always.  And as for fine lines and wrinkles, again I can't see much of a change.

However, I do like the gentle exfoliation results of this.  Whether or not it's worth the extra money I would have to put out to buy this regularly, instead of the scrubs I usually use and which are less expensive, is still a question I'll have to answer with more use.  If after using all 2 oz of this green apple peel I do see a noticeable difference in my skin, I'll edit this review.

It is worth mentioning that the product contains no parabens, propylene or butylene gylcol, petroleum, sulphates, PEGs, TEA, DEA, phthalates, GMO, silicones, pesticides, artificial dyes or fragrances.  It does appear to have some less objectionable emulsifiers, thickeners and preservatives included in its 18 ingredients, most of which are natural juices and vitamins.",1

"This cover-up has one thing that most cover-ups do not have.  That is touch of pink. It is awesome.  Most only have a the of tan or a yellow hue, which doesnt work for me.  The slight hint of pink helped it to blend right in with my skin tone.  Also, it works great for red blotches, but not for dark spots under the eyes.  I really haven't found anything that works on this problem.  Remember to use the spatula.  Only get a hint of cover-up on it, put it on your fingers, and barely touch the area you need coverage.

"One star for the scent of old school barber shop. One star for the pleasant cooling sensation that slightly soothes my bloody face.

I have tried shaving with this several different ways, with a brush, in the shower, etc. My face always ends up bleeding all over. Around the same time I also ordered Cremo, which works much better for me. Unfortunately my wife does not like the smell of Cremo, but Proraso is not a feasible alternative. It produces lather that is too thin and scrapes off of my beard before the blade of my double edged razor gets to the hair.",0
Super product!!,1
I've been purchasing this product for about 2 years now. This is my 3rd bottle and I use it every  morning so that goes to show you that a little goes a long way. Plus it's super cheap compared to other cleansers with benzoyl peroxide.,1

"Long time user, really enjoy this product. I have purchased this on Amazon a few times prior to this last time around, and this time I noticed the difference in color and smell as some of the other users have mentioned. The color was lighter than usual almost clear like and had a strong menthol smell all of which is not normal. When I went to use it, there was a minty feel after putting it on which I have never felt after using this product. I immediately stopped using it as I think the product was fake and returned the product. I bought it from Salon Styled.",0
Great product and great service! Thank you!,1
"If I gently dab it on my face, then it is fine.  If I tried to rub it in gently like a moisturizer.  It will ball up, or peels as I do not have the right word to describe it.  I tried to use my blush brush to brush it off, but it is making it worst.  Also, my face turned neon/pale greenish/yellowish after a couple of hours using this sunscreen -- weird!",0
works very well,1
"Idk if their quality dropped over the yrs, but this stuff stinks and doesn't do much for my hair. I'll try something else",0
"Wash off in shower with a body brush and still has bleached my shirts, our sheets, and towels and wash clothes.  We are careful to wash off completely and still having issues.  Also burns and has made my back worse than it was before the doctor told me to use 10% wash on my back.",0
"I have used Paul Mitchell Soft Spray for years, always buying locally. It is the only spray I will use because of it's lightness and has no tackiness. I pretty much use it daily.  This bottle I ordered at Amazon has been very tacky. I wonder if it has added water, also.  I will never again buy this hair spray except at a local Beauty Salon.",0
"I received this in a subscription box where I pay a bimonthly fee and the curator chooses products for me based on a quiz I fill out about my hair (called SHtrands if you are interested).  This brand is new to me.  I have the ""ProQuinoa complex"" shampoo with sage since it appears that multiple items have been listed on this page in the past.

My particular hair concerns were frizz and color protection.  I have naturally light colored hair that I dye black, and it can get kind of brassy looking in the summer.  And I exercise a lot, so I have to shampoo every day.  My hair tends to dry out because of this, which leads to frizz, since I live in Georgia and it is summertime.

This is a sulfate-free shampoo and I do find myself using a lot of it, which is the reason I have taken off one star.  I am going to run out of my bottle in a few weeks.  When I use a lot, I can actually get something that approaches a pretty good lather.  This has a somewhat coconutty scent (I really can't smell the sage at all) and no artificial dyes.  It rinses out of my hair without leaving residue (doesn't make the shower slippery, either, which some sulfate free shampoos can do) and I do feel that my hair is clean afterwards.

With regards to color protection, my hairdresser did a semi-permanent color rinse a few weeks back to try to get rid of some of the brassiness (in her professional opinion this would look best and I trust her judgment).  And, that is still working, despite washing my hair every day in between.  My roots (with permanent dye) are also looking good.  So I am happy with the color protection aspect of this product.

With respect to frizz, this isn't doing much.  It doesn't promise to, so I am not going to lower my rating because of that.  But if you are looking for a multifunctional hair product, this might not be it.  (I use detanglers and oils afterwards to control frizz and if you do that, this could still work for you.)  It may be just too difficult to overcome the Georgia summer humidity.  But I still have to use all my anti-frizz products after I wash my hair.

You can see the full ingredients list on the product page if you zoom in on the images.  It isn't 100% natural or anything like that, but it does have a somewhat less ""chemical"" list of ingredients than a lot of shampoos I've tried.  (For me, that's neither here nor there.  I am primarily concerned that it works and doesn't irritate my scalp or make my hair fall out, and this passes all three of those tests.)

Overall, I like this, but I don't think it is going to end up being THE shampoo for me.",1
"Yes, it smells slightly bad...but not for long before the scent is gone. It's a medicinal scent; and to be honest, I've smelled worse scents in skincare, L'Oreal products come to mind as they are so obnoxiously perfume-y. This absorbs quickly and isn't sticky. I haven't used this serum long enough to see any results, but my face feels very smooth, and make-up goes on easily over this. I'll give updates on any improvements. I'm using only this serum, a plain face moisturizer with no fancy ingredients such as peptides (Neutrogena Hydro Boost) and sunscreen. I read online that if you use peptides, Retin A, etc....the strong stuff, that those shouldn't be used the same time as you apply the TNS serum...which only makes sense if you think about it, because the ingredients may compete against one another.

SkinMedica is a subsidiary of Allergan, which makes Botox and Juvederm, so more than likely a ton of research has gone into making this serum.

Update after 2 weeks: No changes in my skin texture or firmness.",1
Very disappointed at the size for the price.  I have used this perfume for a long time and do not remember paying so much for such a small bottle.,0
"I assume this is a knockoff, considering the price. You wouldn't know it by the trueness of scent and how long it lasts into the day. Great fresh, summer cologne.",1
"This product use to be strong and makes my hair HARD like a rock and i loved it because no one can tell that u have powder on ur F***** hair. Now for some reasons its all wet and nasty and once someone put their hands in ur hair, oh lord have mercy for the embarrassing moment that you will have. When its RAINING, please run and DO NOT AND YES I SAID DO NOT let anyone see u in that horrific, disgusting, and terrible moment. ONLY GOD KNOWS WHAT I BEEN THROUGH",0
"This stuff is garbage. I must be missing something because everyone else seems to love it, but it just made my hair look sort of damp and dull. It didn't do anything for texture, style, volume - terrible. Do not recommend.",0
"I've tried concealers before but they always looked so obvious.  These colors really blend in and no one would guess you're wearing a concealer. (I apply mine with a brush and just ""dab"" it to blend into skin) - works GREAT.",1
"Bought this curling iron about 3 months ago and the spring has already
broken.  To use it, I have to manually push it closed.  The spring, which looks
very cheap, actually shifted out of place.  I tried to force it back to realign
correctly, this worked for 1 day, and then it shifted back.  This is the first
time I have bought this brand and will never purchase from them again.  All the other
curling irons I have had have lasted for years and years.  Can't believe this one
lasted only 3 months.  What a waste of money!  Other posters here have also had
the spring fail, so this is not an isolated problem.  Do NOT buy this.",0
"Bought into the hype. Bought a bottle. It didn't do anything amazing, I've had better results with UB's De-Slick and NYX Matte Setting Spray. And bonus: this stuff made my face itch.",0
"It wasn't as long-lasting as I expected, but I like the fragrance.  It arrived more quickly than I expected.  Maybe I just have to put more on",1
"I purchased from Costco. Been using about a week. I am turning 30 in July just thought I need to take prevenitive measures. This cream makes my skin go numb after applying. Like going to the dentist and getting numbed up.. that feeling a few hours after your dentist appt you still feel it but not as intense. That's how this cream makes my skin feel. I think it will do the job... Don't know if I like the numb feeling though. I like that you only need like a dot and it does the job. Makes my skin feel smooth, is lightweight and no funny odor.",1
"I know this is probably not fair to the product itself because it works great, but my teeny bottle was half empty when it got to me.  It didn't have the top on tight and it leaked into the packaging.",0
"This is absolutely the best lotion.  I use it all the time on my feet and hands.  It is creamy, NOT greasy and smells terrific too!  I love it so much that I also buy it in travel sizes for my purse.  The only con with this is that when it gets to the end it no longer pulls through the pump and there is quite a bit left.  With this being as expensive as it is, you don't want to waste it.  I turn it upside down in an old small baby food jar and it fills the jar quite a bit...easily 1 - 2 ounces.",1
"This product of Nivea is awesome in 3 regards
1- moisturizer embedded in a wash gel. That's pretty much a need in everyday  showering . Reason- regular soap based gels dry your skin and hence more susceptible to micro rupture.
2- price for that much volume of good product. Yes it's not going to put a hole in pocket, for a good brand .
3- the fragrance is just beautiful . It's like old good Nivea product without any indication of  extra strong male/ female indication . It's unisex fragrance and suit you for your daily need.",1
Great hairdryer for the price. Cut down on the time it took to dry my hair and it's shinier with less heat. The only down side is that the attachment gets REALLY hot so you have to wait for it to cool down to handle.,1
The brush is crap and the formula of the actual mascara seems to be different that the original Black Magic. This one is very stiff and extremely hard to wash off even with eye makeup remover. I would have never gotten it if the other was in stock and available. Very disappointed.,0
Bought this for keratosis Pilaris on my arms. It didn't work after a month of daily use.,0
Great for the price,1
"Excellent, love the product, goes on smoothly and does the job.
I have been using this line for the last several months, my skin
looks and feels wonderful.  It's nice to finally find a product that
truly works with sensitive skin.  Recommend.",1
My nail polish came cracked I keep trying to send a message and I get no response $10 isn't cheap for a nail polish so it's upsetting when you get a cracked bottle,0
"This is a terrific tool for eliminating frizz. Heats up fast, works even faster.",1
"I was really hoping I would like this product based on all of the reviews and articles I've seen. However, I wasn't impressed. I've found a mud mask works a lot better.",0
Smell Amazing ...,1
"I've bought several of the NIA skin care products; I bought this product from a medi spa where these products were really being pushed. I applied it exactly as directed and a few hours later broke out in pus-filled hives to all areas applied to...decolletage & throat,hands,forearms,neck and lower face. Now you may think...maybe it was something else that made the hives pop up? ...but the thing was you could actually see exactly where my hands & fingers had applied it to my skin and it happened 2 x's, the first time I was not sure it was this product,Sun Damage Repair Decolletage & Hands...but you could see the trail of where my hand & fingers had applied it...all red w/ small pustule-like bumps/hives...it left brown spots after healing. It left my skin damaged w/ brown spots where the pustules/hives had been...now I have to do TCA peels to remove the brown scarring I was left with. I will not use this again and I'm using up other NIA24 products and going back to exclusively to Perricone. I am ok with some of the other NIA24 products but they do seem to contain high amounts of waxy substances that leave a residue on my facial skin.
Not just disappointed with this...upset!",0
no better than Sally's no chip polish.,0
"I tried it for keratosis pilaris. I heard great reviews from it. Unfortunately, it didn't work. It made it a little smoother for a couple days, but that wore off, and you HAVE to use moisturizer with the lotion because it doesn't spread very easily and you'll use too much of the product otherwise. It didn't do anything for the redness. Way too expensive to keep waiting for it to work. I used it for three months with no real results. In the past, I've also tried Amlactin, but that never worked for me like I hear it has for others. For people with stubborn skin, I wouldn't recommend.",0
My favorite scent! I always get a lot of compliments. Clean and sweet scent. Just wish it lasted all day...,1
"I purchased this because I saw it on QVC. I get it home and see it is regular polish, you keep it on 3 days and take off with remover. How that helps nails become stronger using toxic remover twice a week I can't image, Will not use it, waste of 18.00",0
"If you love the smell of Vicks Vapor Rub, you will love this product.  Unfortunately, I'm not fond of that medicinal smell, so I won't be buying this product again. The salt works fine, but the aroma is overpowering. I will look for something that actually smells good.",0
My husband loves this! Sulfate free is important and his scalp seems to be better behaved than when he was using tea-tree shampoo or other random shampoos I had around.,1
Needs a better application system on this cannister thats already included.,0
"Definitely nothing dramatic. I think more so than not this product works psychologically. If putting it on makes you feel better after or the next day, making you think you look darker so you walk with more confidence, then by all means, this may be the product for you. It's not like Bondi Sands or anything that really gives you color. I used this with my summer tan so I couldn't tell a difference. May try again when I'm super white. I think a drop got on my foot accidentally and the next day I saw a spot so I guess it does do something to some degree. -shrugs-",0
Spent $33 on this hair spray product that I love and when I went to use it - it did NOT spray,0
"Shade was perfect for my skintone (chinese).  I have extremely oily skin..espescially my T zone.  Provides lightweight coverage which I am happy with but I find if my skin breaks out, my liquid foundation gives me much better coverage. I like wearing this on my skin on a day to day basis as it is very natural looking...I can't believe at 44 that I am still breaking out..maybe when I'm 50 it will come to an end!",1
"After reading the reviews, I won't buy it here... I will go to a CK store and get it.

Thank you!",0
Won't charge.... I'll try and put a new rechargeable battery in. But not impressed so far.,0
Solid.,1
I need to buy this polish in every color.  This is the best sparkle in my opinion.,1
Left nails with bumpy texture.,0
This polish is great. I took it to my local nail salon and the manicurist used vinylux top coat along with it. No base necessary. It lasted a week!,1
Very disappointing,0
"I found this scent the hard way, by scratching off the little perfume spot off the glossy photo in the ladies fashion magazines! It's not like I hate the mall, it just not very convenient to go from where I work and live.

I tested several, but took the gamble to splurge on the scent, which it's nice, rich, classy smell lingered with out being ""in your face"". The perfume notes are definitely feminine. The negative? Maybe that it's a bit short on staying power, but that's ok by me. It came sturdily boxed, then well set within it's own glossy pretty pink and white box. Lastly, it pools inside a heavy but lovely perfume decanter.

I have waited for awhile to buy myself perfume and it was a great find for me.",1
"The shipping was unbelievably fast; took about 2 days to get here and the moment YOY first put the mousse on you can instantly fell a difference. There is a slight tanning smell to the mousse, however it is tolerable unlike some self tanners. I also bought the dark st. Tropez and an eager to compare the two. When applying this product make to EXFOLIATE and apply lotion to the wrists, elbows, KNEES, and ankles. This will reduce the chance of the mousse getting more in these areas and will even it out a bit. Definitely going to be buying another bottle!",1
"This product's first ingredient is dimethicone, considered safe by EWG, but terribly drying. I found that my face and palms grew dryer with each use, and using other moisturizers (like natural oils and shea butter) under it and at night couldn't overcome the drying effect. Stopped using it after a week and skin returned to normal within a few days. This might work for you if you have oily skin, but folks with dry skin be cautious. Information on dimethicone suggests that it not be used regularly anyway, as it acts very much the same way as petroleum jelly, blocking normal skin function. Unfortunately, dimethicone is in just about everything. This product seems to have a very high amount, however; I haven't had difficulty with it in products where the ingredient is further down on the ingredients list. FYI, Juice Beauty Sport is a mineral sunscreen that is dimethicone free.",0
"I will never purchase it again as I don't feel any difference when using it or without it. I start smelling bad really fast and seems like it is not working at all. Maybe because of my skin or my body, idk. Had to order another deo after i realized that this one doesn't fit me.",0
"I have thin, brittle hair that gets very knotty. I need a good detangle for after the shower. I think this works pretty good but a lot of my thin hair still comes out in the brush.
It didn't  really  detangle my thin hair as good as i hoped for after reading all the great reviews. However, it has been one of th best Ive found. Still waiting to find my miracle detangler...",1
"I know this product and love it--this is a great price, so I thought I'd give it a try from Amazon. First time I purchased on Amazon was in January 2015-using that bottle now and the cleanser is very watered down.  I'm using it, but not happy with the consistency at all.  I just purchased another bottle this month, and tried it-it seems nice and thick, like I am used to.  Guess I just got a bad batch the first time.",0
"This comb is attractive and has a nice weight and shape to it.  Only you can decide if it's worth the price over a drugstore comb, but the main differences are (1) weight (2) how finely rounded the edges are.

The comb feels substantial and it's size makes it easy to grip.  Any comb will probably do the job of getting out tangles, but the tines of this comb feel smoother on the scalp and has a nicer weight to it than comparably-sized combs that are less expensive.

The acetate material will become slightly cloudy from combing action (hair being pulled along the frame will cause fine scratches that remove some of the out-of-the-box shine), but it doesn't affect the generally attractive tortoiseshell appearance.

Another thing to note is that I have owned a similar comb by a British company (Kent Brushes), and cellulose acetate is no more durable (in fact, it may even be more brittle) than harder plastics.

Overall, I recommend this comb, but I'm sure it's worth the sticker price.

Edited to add: I've had this comb for over a year and it still looks and works great.  Prefer it to other combs I've had and thus for durability I'm upgrading it to 5 stars (instead of the 4 stars in my original review).",1
"I love this product, its perfect for my skin type.  But the last bottle I ordered came damaged, the pump came apart, and would not work.  Luckily I kept the bottle that was empty and was able swap the pumps.",1
Exceptionally rugged dependable but for the price quite low on features  with only one or two possible head replacement options I found that also limiting to my needs this was due to construction parameters although they would attach they could not operate properly.,0
"I love Lord and Berry products! However, I had mixed emotions when using this eyeliner. I love how creamy and pigmented it was. I just wish I was able to use this on my waterline or even on my eyelids. It kept smudging and it wasn't waterproof. But I was able to easily get a dramatic bold look with the smudging effect.",1
"I love this eyeliner, but it seems the majority of the make-up I've ordered from Amazon are defected. Like they're dried out. I've bought this same eyeliner in the past from Sephora and the liquid flowed out much smoother and thicker. The one I just received seems old or dried out a bit and therefore it's not as dark and rich as it should be. I don't think I'll be buying make-up from Amazon again.",0
"love this product, best moisturizer ever",1
"This product was NOT as smooth and creamy as the product we sampled at our condo, in Hawaii.  Disappointed....especially for the price.  Yikes!",0
"I was really hoping this would be a great product, especially given the price tag and number of great reviews.  While it did cover the gray upon application, the product ""faded"" and my roots were showing before the end of the work day.  My $8 cover-up stick lasts longer and is much cheaper.",0
"I was so excited for this curling iron to ship after I ordered it.  I had never spent so much on a curling iron before but it looked and sounded like it would be the best.  I was poring over the reviews for this one as well as several others. I have a lot of hair that holds a curl (usually) all day long and wanted a fatter iron for bigger curls.  Well, this one is fatter, but my curls don't last more than 20 minutes after I leave the house! I have used product to help them stay, hair spray, not touching them until they have cooled - nothing helps.  I've even turned the heat up and left the hair in the iron longer, to no avail.  I'm on the lookout again for another iron...This time I may pick a metal one as opposed to the ceramic coated kind - my old metal one made curls that lasted all day long.

The weight of this curling iron is awesome though...and I love how the cord isn't stuck in place so when you're curling, the cord doesn't impede you.

Just very bummed out about this purchase...",0
Package arrived open and spilled wasted my money will never buy again,0
"Great seller, fast shipping! product as advertised. Love that I can dry my hair in less amount of time, the long cord makes it super easy to move around and not get disconnected. I had to buy a brush even with long hair I only used my hands, but because of fast drying I need to brush my hair, but I do not mind it at all.",1
"These do nothing for me. Ugh.

And you're supposed to not use them right after shaving... which I find annoying.",0
"This stuff really works!  Unfortunately, I am allergic to something in it so I passed it to a friend.",1
Love this foundation. Sheer yet covers well. Great summer makeup!,1
"The original formula stinks like licorice. I've heard so many great things about this shampoo and its great smell. So I'm not sure if I got an old batch, or perhaps this reseller sent a faulty/fake product. The volumizing formula was pretty nice. Overall I'm dissapointed in what I recieved, especially considering the price. Don't order from this seller, go straight to the manufacturer.",0
Used this twice already helps prevent hair from burning in flat iron,1
Beautiful shade.  My nails grow fast.  I love to wear it when my nails are mid-length but not too long.,1
"I used Klorane many years ago, and I remember it being a very luxurious shampoo. The formula must have changed, because this shampoo was HORRIBLE.  It stripped my hair! My hair was a tangled mess and even a leave-in conditioner didn't allow me to get a comb through it. Also, it doesn't lather -- or it barely lathers -- and it doesn't rinse out very well. Although the scent of the shampoo in the bottle is nice, on my hair it smelled so bad that I actually had to rewash my hair a few hours later with something else to get the smell out.  The scent is a cross between an insecticide and cheap perfume. I am really disappointed, as this shampoo is not inexpensive.",0
I brought this product over a month ago due to alllllll of the reviews and videos that I have watched online and it is the worst purchase I have ever made.  I am upset that I have waited this long to open it because now I cant get my money back.  I should have tried it out right away.  I would not recommend this product to anyone,0
"This seems to me exactly like mascara simply repackaged and redefined as brow mousse. It goes on the brows too thick and gunky for my taste, the way some mascaras do.  It might work better with a different kind of applicator.",0
"This product definitely seems to help with dandruff and did not irritate my skin which is a plus because I have extremely sensitive skin. This shampoo just does not lather well, but otherwise is great.",1
"It feels very similar with Anchors Courage Clay (except for the smell), very soft and creamy texture with a good amount of shine along with a long lasting vanilla scent. The scent is so creamy, I felt like having vanilla cake batter in my hair, which also gave me a headache during summer time.  The holding power is slightly stronger than Anchors Courage Clay, it is about 5 out 10. The only plus is easy to wash out, one wash with shampoo should be enough.",0
it only lasts 3 weeks and then dries up..it has happened to 2 tubes and never happens with the regular back tube mascara....i do like the larger brush it comes with.,0
I love this product... smells absolutely amazing and it doesn't make ur hair all gross,1
"The highlighting powder is great, the pink does not show up and the bronzer is orange. It looks like a nice brown but on your skin it gets very orange. I am fair skinned. Also it is powder not cream. Overall not worth the money.",0
I tried this spray at Dillards and loved it.  This doesnt smell anything like the one at the department store.  Plus it only lasts about an hour!,0
"After looking at several beard oils, this one stood out to be a great formulation. Keeps my beard soft with daily use. There is a scent that reminds me of women's deodorant - it's not bad at all, but I can understand why some wouldn't like. It's not noticable after an hour anyways. Will by again.",1
Problem straightening thick wavy hair.  Needs straightening spray.  Otherwise a good product.  I recommend for most types of hair.unisex.  One of the best.,1
"This was recommended to me by my dermatologist. good & creamy disappears quickly on my dry skin. Compares with my favorite skin medica eye cream. It is pricey but aren't all eye creams. However, this is worth a try as it really smooths those pesky crows feet!",1
"Scent is somewhat ""loud"", and does not have a creamy feel to it.  I have very dry skin and hoped this cream might provide some relief.  But it did not.",0
"Made my hair greasy and I only used two pumps!  I tried it three times, it just didn't work for me.",0
"I'm a big fan of pre-shave oils because they really do help my shave, probably more than any other product.  The first pre-shave oil I tried was Art of Shaving, which was great.  I like to try different products just to see if one might be better than the other or of better value if they work just the same.  The Zirh Prepare is no longer in the running.

It works just ok, when compared to the Art of Shaving pre-shave oil and the Anthony Logistics pre-shave oil.  The others do a better job of softening my facial hair.  Also, the others come in 2 ounce bottles.  When you do the math, the Zirh Prepare costs $16 per ounce, while the Art of Shaving is $11 and Anthony Logistics $9 per ounce.

It's a no brainer.  Take Zirh's PREPARE off your list.",0
Ok,1
"I received Samoan Sand thinking it would actually be a sandy color. I have very pale olive skin and thought it would be a good match. However, upon application it is very orangey-pink tan which clashed horribly with my skin. This would be a good nude if you have a pink undertone, but it just didn't work well with my greenish/yellow undertone.",0

Thank you.,1
This bronzer is VERY messy!!  It gets everywhere.... def not a fan at all.,0
"Update: I wanted so badly to love this product that I waited way too long before finally admitting to myself that it was the cause of the worst breakout I've had in years. My whole forehead was covered in white irritation pimples. They have gone down since I stopped using this three days ago, but my skin is taking a while to recover. This tinted moisturizer is NOT for sensitive, combination/acne-prone skin!

This is the best tinted moisturizer I've used. It's the only one I've used that doesn't oxidize horribly or leave my skin looking shiny and melty at the end of the day. It's mattefying, although not super moisturizing. So, if you have dry skin, you'll probably need another moisturizer underneath it.

Also, ""lighter than light"" is the perfect color for my fair skin. It's more pigmented than other tinted moisturizers I've used, so I think it's the perfect medium between full-coverage foundation, and going au naturel.",0
GREAT!,1
Darker than I hoped.,1
"This worked well to lengthen lashes - for a week. After that, the formula became gunky. I tried to work with it for another week before throwing in the trash.",0
This product works great and doesnt make my hair feel stiff like other similar products. However it is so expensive for the TINY bottle that you get. It seriously only worked for 1 week while I was travelling for work before it was finished. Great product but terrible value!,0
I purchased to go with the Toppik Hair Building Fibers. I made sure to check the size and dimensions before ordering and it simply did not work. The instructions were simple--- screw the applicator on top of the fiber can. Didn't work.,0
"I did not purchase this off of amazon. I did purchase it at Ulta. A store clerk recommended it to me and i don't think i have ever been so disappointed. I purchased the translucent powder and i already have extremely fair skin and this made me look pure WHITE! Like i put flour all over my face. I thought you received a great amount of product for the price and it applied very nicely. The fact that i wear porcelain foundation and this ""translucent"" made me look that white is unacceptable If someone with a medium skin tone were to purchase this there is no way they could wear it. Definitely will not ever purchase this product again!",0
"I bought this for my daughter, who has used this model Chi dryer at her stylist's. She really loves it. Using the diffuser, the Chi dries her naturally curly hair quickly and leaves the curls softer than using other hairdryers with diffusers. If you have curly hair, I know she would recommend that you purchase this product.",1
This is the cream I use every night and every morning. Works well for intolerant skin!,1
No good,0
"This is great stuff!! It's light, absorbs fast, and lasts all day. Even better, it DOESN'T cause breakouts. I am sold on Jack Black products, they are definitely superior",1
"I got it on February and by March it is having overheat incidents everytime I use it on the hot setting and highest speed. The dryer shuts off in the middle of the process (10 minutes after it is turned on) when my hair is still wet. It is very frustating since it doesn't turn back on until it has cooled down.

Not what I'd expected from such a good rating dryer.",0
"I purchased this shampoo because it is supposed to be a gentle, daily shampoo for hair prone to oiliness.  My hair is prone to oiliness so I normally wash my hair every other day and I hoped this shampoo would make a difference so I gave it a good try. However, I still have to wash my hair every other day because my scalp is still prone to oiliness but now my hair is dry and dull like straw.  The shampoo is the consistency of water which makes it difficult to apply.  The bottle is metal and not squeezable so I would pour it into my hand but I would loose half of the shampoo before getting it to my hair. I resorted to pouring it directly on my hair but I could not tell how much I was using/wasting.  The shampoo smells slightly medicinal when my hair was wet but when dry there was no fragrance at all. There was nothing redeeming about Phyto Phytopanama . I wish I could find a shampoo that really would be gentle on my poor over-washed hair and also help control oily scalp.......This one was not it so the search continues.",0
"Sounds like a great product, I read reviews and how to use the product.  It is a lot of work and really did not make my hair look or feel any better than it usually does.",0
"Cute colors, the polish sucks though. Not worth the money!",0
It is very lightweight which I like. The only downside is that while holding athe dryer while drying my hair the power/velocity switch can be easily pushed inadvertently.  This is annoying. The placement could be improved. Other than this I love the dryer.,1

I couldn't survive without this stuff! Its the best spray to keep my skin hydrated and works wonders when traveling on planes. Love this product!,1
"I purchased the no. 2. This is a really nice concealer; it is great for redness. It is a thin formula, and I would not recommend it for some serious coverage. It is not so great for dark circles. You probably want something a little thicker. Depending on how dry your skin is, you might want to moisturize a bit before using this concealer. I have rather dry skin, and I combine this with Jojoba Oil (otherwise, it's too dry). I use this every day for redness around my nose and cheeks, and a tube lasted me approximately 2 months.",1
The rinse and other products did not whiten my teeth at all.  I used them as directed for more than 30 days with no results at all.,0
"This curling iron gets very hot and makes very nice curls. I liked it so much I bought a smaller size too and was considering buying a medium sized one. Then one day while I was curling my hair, it popped and began to smoke. It no longer works. I expect a product like this to have a longer life that the one year I got out of it. It was MADE IN CHINA and so maybe I should have expected that it was not a quality product. In general CHINESE quality control isn't very good or doesn't exist at all. Lesson learned.",0
The guard is so large it makes it impossible to get the hairs right under the nose. So basically your mustache always turns into a fade unless you take of the guard and try to estimate the length yourself and trim with just the blade,0
On/off light does not work.,0
This soap exceeds most otbers I have tried.  Very nice mild fragrance. Exfoliates quite well.,1
Took forever for my hair to dry.,0
"It was good about absorbing oil, but the smell of it is awful! It smells like rubber tires on a hot day. The smell lingers even after washing your face many times. If you get headaches from smells DO NOT get this product.",0
Great Stuff!!,1
This is always on my wife's Christmas list; she loves this one and the Eucalyptus.  Great for clearing your head.,1
Great colors does not last the week.,1
"I have read many positive things about AHAVA products so I was excited to try this moisturizer. I have been using this product on my face, neck and hands (which are quite dry) and I have been impressed by how soft it makes my skin feel. Like a silky, light powder feeling once absorbed. I want to note I did not experience any clogged pore feeling or breakouts. Best of all, no greasy feeling!

The only problem I had with it is that it doesn't work well on my face under makeup. I tried using it with/without a primer and with two different liquid foundations and every time my foundation looked cakey and quickly oxidized to an unflattering orange color. However, I will continue to use this on days when I don't wear foundation. This limitation is the reason for the one star deduction.

The last thing I'd like to mention is if you are sensitive to smells this moisturizer does have a distinct ""perfume"" scent. It's not overpowering but worth mentioning for those with sensitivity.

Overall, it is an excellent moisturizer.",1
Used this for going on 6 years now. Does good for me. Most of my friends my age are grey haired. Me not so much. This stuff? I don't know. Maybe it helps for that too.,1
Doesn't give much of a lather and didn't like the smell.,0
Awful....,0
I loved this product.  The smells is amazing and the product works great.,1
"I actually received this eyeliner in a glam bag and I instantly loved it.  Very smooth, no flaking, stays on all day!! I tend to have a more oily eyelid and the liner stays put!
I would have given it a 5 if I could have gotten the liner out of its plastic wrap.....was not easy!  The other reason I didn't give a 5 is the cost.  I wish it was a few bucks cheaper.  17$ is expensive.
But otherwise, its an awesome product!",1
"Great hair gel. I apply this after I shampoo my hair, while it is still wet, and comb my hair in place and let it dry. For several days I only have to dry comb or sometimes wet comb my hair to get it back in shape. Washes out easiy, does not build up over time. Can be used on dry hair, but I've not needed to do that.",1
"I received product in mail, opened the damaged box & tube was empty of product.",0
"Not impressed. This product did not work for me. It's thick and white when you apply it. Although it does sink into your skin and doesn't leave any white residue, it did not color correct for me. I have some spots where acne is healing that are red and this did nothing. I ordered the ""light"" and probably could've gone darker but I'm not a fan. Product feels heavy, not light weight which is more what I prefer. I'm returning it.",0
This John Varvatos has only remnants of the smell of the one they sell at department stores. A watered down version. Has a strong ethanol scent for its top notes. Base notes resemble JV but only lasts for a couple of hours. This may be fake. I should've spent an extra $20 and bought at Sephora.,0
"Really didn't like it, but gave it an extra star cause it does smell great. Just didn't work with my fine hair.",0
"I had a french manicure at a Ritz Carlton in FL using all the Vinylux products. Being on the beach, swimming/sunscreen & sand the manicure literally lasted all week, which prompted me to buy the very same products as soon as I got home. Disappointment! I don't know what is different, but w/ less wear & tear on my nails being home, I'm lucky if I can get 2-3 days before it chips. Won't purchase again.",0
So i initially got a refund for this order and my points back that i used. The order landed about one week after the promised date. THe box was torn open and the packaging of the item was also damaged. when plugged in the item did not work so i threw it in the trash thinking all along i got a refund of my money and points. Only to find out about two days ago i did not receive a refund or the points i used back. Total rip off,0
"This is the best face moisturizer I've used. Two pumps is all I need, so this will last a long time. The only negative is that the pump doesn't always work because I lay the bottle flat in my drawer. I'd prefer a squeeze tube, so I'll have to go with the smaller tube version next time.",1
"I have very, very sensitive eyes and the Gel is right on. It did not sting my eyes and was very light not sticky. I would definitely order this product again.",1
"This shampoo is ok.  It smells nice, and has a unique thick consistency.  My hair was shiny after I used it--though not hugely different than when I use any other shampoo.  The shampoo does NOT deliver results that render it worth the ridiculously high price, though!  The label claims it to be ""the fountain of youth for hair"" and to ""protect your hair and hair color"", and touts all the amazing ingredients in it.  Yet, when I looked up the ingredients, the 2nd and 3rd ingredients (after water) are Sodium Laureth Sulfate, and Fragrance...the same JUNK you would get in any 99 cent bottle of drugstore brand shampoo!  Sodium Laureth Sulfate is an inexpensive lathering product--basically a detergent--and one that is commonly known to fade color treated hair, not protect it! (Many hair stylists recommend sulfate-free shampoos for color treated hair). You have to go way down the ingredient list, past a long list of chemicals, to get to the ""pure plant extracts"" that the label touts.  You can easily find a better shampoo, for 1/10 the price. I won't waste my money on this again.",0
very bad product !! color didn't go on evenly and went away as soon as body was washed,0
"The kiddy orange color and smell are show stoppers for me. Product performance isn't bad, but I can't abide by the color and smell. Prefer Admiral, or Reuzel.",0
The size of the brush I received was somewhere between a small and a medium sized brush - not even close to an XL.,0
"I am Korean and have dark hair that gets oily pretty quickly. The product stays white in my hair, so then I look like I'm going grey...It also doesn't do much for my hair. My hair still looks oily and flat. I have yet to find a great dry shampoo. I'm disappointed I spent this much money on a product that doesn't work well.",0
I have been using this product for about while and love it!  Great products!,1
So disappointed.  I got two diff colors and was surprised at how unevenly it goes on and it was chipping within the first 24 hours.  I wish I had looked at other reviews online before I purchased.  At this price I expected superb quality.  Don't waste your money.,0
"I really like this. I use it on my face (acne) and hair. It is much more natural than most products as well. Also works to help style your hair.

Only issue is if it is hot outside I have to let my skin absorb it before I go out otherwise it will just come out (live in florida).",1
"It sprays well and evenly. It doesn't gunk up and my hair is not left too stiff. It holds relatively well.
But, the scent is strong and persistent, especially right after you sprays it. It goes away after some time but you still get a whiff of it once in awhile through out the day. Then, when you are just about to forget about it, you get another strong whiff while you are trying to wash your hair in the shower. And it's strong enough for me to cringe a bit.
It could be that my tolerance for fragrance has gone down considerable since I've started using products with less or no fragrance and stop using cologne since having babies in the house for past few years... but I have used other hairspray with some fragrance in them and it didn't cause me to such adverse reaction to it.",0
"I have tried many spf lip balm in the past and this is the first one that I can actually say that i like and that I continue to use. It has a nice moisturizing balm feel to it and you don't see the tint or any color once you put it on, though in the tube it looks like a dark tan. It doesn't have a ton of sheen, so I can use it above my top lip where I have melasma and it doesn't get all shiny or greasy. I just tap or rub it in a little in that area and it's just as good as using a regular sunscreen there. It's not as dry or matte as most of the other sunscreen balms I've used and that's one of the reasons I like it so much. It actually softens and moisturizes your lips while using it. It is light and smooth and gets the job done perfectly. Sort of amazing with such a great spf level.",1
"LIGHT, SUFFICIENT, DRIES THE HAIR FAST, POWERFUL, LONG CORD, BUT ON THE LOUD SIDE. THIS IS MY FIRST SOLANO DRYER, AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT.",1
"Excellent Product, I bought for each of my girls and a friend!",1
It's okay .... does not remove as much of my cuticlel as I expected.  Would not order again.,0
"Love this curling iron. I have super thick, straight hair. With some product added and hairspray, this curling iron curls nicely. Gets nice and hot.",1
if you care about your beard stay away from this stuff. it has harsh chemicals in it that are not good for your beard. Just buy pine tar soap and beard oils. Both are all nature. Are just make your own beard oils like i do.,0
"NO BREAK OUTS!!!  I am a person that has extremely sensitive skin.  Especially, around the eyes.  I break out from even hypo-allergenic products.  But, I do love LaRoche- Posay products. At first, just tested it two nights under one eye.  It is creamy, smooth and feels lovely going on.  I apply it twice a day and even under make-up.  I do not know if it works, nor have I seen any results, it's only been a few days, but I am enthusiastic and looking forward to my future post.",1
Doesn't make my face matte. Still shiny. Stopped using because it doesn't do anything to my face to make it less shiny.,0
The first time I used it I loved it!!!! I used it the next day and it made hair feel very heavy... by the third day it looked oily and unwashed. Not impressed,0
The curls did not last.,0
"This is really no better than any other AHA exfoliating product. Results are similar to another product I purchased after this which was roughly 1/8 the cost per ounce. Save an exorbitant amount of money and choose another, cheaper AHA.",0
I have used this product many times and love it. Chose to buy it through Amazon instead of my facial lady because it was cheaper. THAT WAS A MISTAKE. when I receive the product it was sealed came in the box that I would normally purchase it in. When I opened it it was sealed in plastic and completely full to the top. Normally that would be a great thing but every time I have purchased this product it's never that full. When I opened it the smell of the product was different and when I used it it felt very soapy. Almost as if someone put dish soap in it. Mind you I have used this product for over a year now and I know what it feels like and smells like. At this point I would like to return it but can't because I have had it for two weeks (bought and delivered when I was out of town) but I won't be repurchasing it,0
"I am using the volumnizing shampoo. I absolutely love this shampoo. I have had it for about five months now and still have not finished the bottle off. My hair feels plump as I wash it off and when my hair dries it looks shiny and big. My hair is usually covered in oil after a day, but I feel like this helps to give me an extra day without having to wash my hair. I love this line and the look of their products.",1
Absolutely exactly what I needed! The lowest price I found also. I have extremely long hair and it's excellent to be able to come or brush the conditioner through in the shower this is strong enough to get through all of my hair. Easier to grip and does not slip out with the slightest tangle,1
"A little does go a long way with this stuff and it does cover my roots, but I hate the way it leaves my hair feeling after. I try to use as little as possible but the texture of my hair is disgusting after putting this stuff on it.",0
Didn't like this product.  Way to difficult to remove.,0
seems like last year it was a tad better.  Great thing is the smell is great as opposed to most self-tanners.  I think I need to apply for several days in a row to get the look I want.,1
"Ordered light blonde received what appeared to be light green, tried it twice and both times it looked terrible. I wasted my money but at least I ws smart enough to purchase the smallest trial size for less than $ 7.",0
"This was one of the gifts I gave my mother from my daughter for Christmas. Also bought the butter foundation to go with, from another seller. The foundation was great, but this nail polish was received thick and goopy. Unusable. I think it was old. Or maybe stored in a hot environment. Very disappointed. This isn't a cheap polish. I expected more, a lot more.",0
The top came with tape on it.,0
great,1
"This product was awful.  First it came not working, however if it did I could not figure out from the design of it how it could actually curl your lashes.",0

Great way to sample quality of product without spending a lot of money.,1
Clumps,0
"A 5 star review?? What is everyone smoking! This palette couldn't be any worse. The packaging is cheaply made and doesn't latch properly. The brush is terrible quality, and the shadows...Lord, the shadows are a mess. No pigmentation on the eyes and zero color payoff. People are swatching this on their arms with nice results, but lets face it, you don't wear shadow on your arm. Well, some of you might judging by the reviews....

Terrible. I paid $13 and they had the audacity to go UP during the holidays. Do yourself and your loved ones a favor. Steer clear unless you're buying for kids play makeup.",0
Very pasty looking! difficult to make the color look even on nails.,0
My lashes looked better with nothing on them! They looked sparse and skinny. I love the concept though.,0
"Excellent product. I've been buying the same one for three years and it works perfectly.
Fast delivery, product in excellent conditions. I recommend it.",1
Left my hair feeling tacky and difficult to comb through.,0
"This color is very fun, but a little bright for me.",1
Received product and was nothing like a previous bottle I had purchased from Sephora. This one smelt like it had been replaced with some sort of oil... Authenticity is questionable,0
Great,1
Great product for my acne prone teens.,1
Ok first off this works amazing I freaking wear matte lipstick that doesn't come off unless u scrub it or use soap but this cloth just wipes it off freaking amazing idk how they do it but I gave 4 stars Nevis I pretty much have to wash it every day u use it wiping all that makeup on the cloth u definitely have to wash it and it's annoying,1
"This product is amazing! It transformed my hair, definetly worth it!!",1
"Don't lose the charger.  They have designed it to be incompatible with other chargers, so if you lose it you are forced to buy another one from them at two to three times the cost you would pay elsewhere.",0
"Good product based on a recommendation from YouTube Beauty Guru, Jackie Aina.  Good for everyday use for a natural look.",1
I liked this cleansing lotion until I saw that Boric Acid is one of it's ingredients.  I wish they had shown the list of ingredients on the amazon page.,0
"When you pay $35 for a comb, you expect quality.  You don't expect a tooth to snap off after a few months while combing your hair, and you don't expect it to snap in half some months later while combing your hair.  I bought this wide tooth rake to comb my wet hair after getting out of the shower and spraying in leave-in conditioner/detangler.  I have fine Caucasian hair that a comb shouldn't have any difficulty getting through, especially after it has been washed, double conditioned, and detangler.  This piece of overpriced schlock snapped a tooth, then, later, snapped in half, after NORMAL use.  It wasn't dropped.  It wasn't used improperly.  I think I'll stick with my cheap Goody wet comb that I've had since graduate school (25+ years).  It's still going.  I POSTED A PHOTO RELATING TO MY REVIEW.  PLEASE, CHECK IT OUT, BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THIS CHEESY COMB.",0
It smells great! The only hair oil I use.,1
Lasts only 3 days after applying two layers. It chips off real fast and gives a damp result. Will not be buying from this brand again.,0
I really like this product but wish it came in a darker shade.  I have very sensitive skin and lots of allergies.  This does not cause any problems with them.  It is a lightweight coverage and just perfect for my skin.,1
"I got this for my husband who needs to wear a high SPF sunscreen. We both prefer the mineral type but in high levels, it leaves a white ""mask"" effect.  This does, too, but not to the degree other brands we've tried.  It's also not too greasy and absorbs well after a 10-15 minutes.  At that point, if you blend it in some more, the white cast is almost invisible.",1
"Ironically, the first time I tried this I broke nail. The second time, I noticed my nails chipped sooner. The third time, I just finally realized this is just not for me. Considering it's price, I expected waaayyyy more. I will definitely be sticking to my Essie Grow Stronger and Essie Grow Faster.",0
"It may have been user error but I could not make anything happen with this iron. I read the directions and tried on three occasions to get a curl. No beep. No motion. No anything.  The directions stated that your hair had to be in a specific condition, specifically sized to work. I tried everything I could with no result. The iron seemed hot on the inside but it did not grab hair as described. Might have been lovely but I returned it.",0
A lot brighter in person. The picture looks a lot darker and didn't go with my complexion so I gave it to my mom.,0
did not stay on more than 3 days,0
"Great product, sulfate free. Very safe on my colored hair just didn't leave it as soft as some other products i have used.",1
After using it as instructed I didn't see any hair loss. I have light skin and darker hair so I really thought it would work for me.,0
"Clean, masc scent",1
Love this product,1
"I had a reaction to this cream. My eyes were red, dry and I looked 10 years older after using it for 4 days. I continued thinking my skin needed to adjust to s new cream but only got worse. I wanted it to work but it's not for me. I have returned it. Thank you.",0
"produce was broken, the spring loaded top was visibly broken.  It appeared defective from as soon as I opened the box.",0
"I have used this product for 3 weeks now, I use it in the morning on my face and neck and arms, feels great.",1
Not a fan of this sunscreen. SUPER thick when applying and doesn't absorb/dry well. I look like I painted myself white wearing this stuff. It's $10 more but Men Science sunscreen is a billion times better. I love Jack Black's SPF lip balms though!,0
It does make your skin really soft .,1
"This apparently is no longer available.  The reason is probably because of fakes.  It wasn't a terrible (the ralph polo black was).  It has a strong smell of floral, very strong smell of something like that.  Not sure if I got a fake product.  I would steer clear of this.",0
"As I write this on 5/25/2013 there is only one other review of this product. That reviewer rated this cream 4 stars and I agree.

Price: 5 stars. I paid $13.00 plus tax at Merz Apothecary here in Chicago. They are the brick-and mortar for Smallflower on Amazon. The tube is very large and will last a long time, especially if you use more than one cream/soap in a rotation.

Lather: 4 stars. I squeezed about the same amount onto my shaving brush as I would if I were squeezing tooth paste onto a tooth brush. There was only enough lather for two passes. I had to add a little bit of cream to the brush for my third pass. The lather was good but not great. This will not give you ""cool whip"" like lather but it is still perfectly good for a good shave.

Cushion: 5 stars. No problems here.

Slickness: 4 stars. Something like Taylor's of Old Bond Street is much slicker but you have to pay up.

Razor burn protection/skin condition after the shave: 5 stars. Excellent results.

Scent: 4 stars. I like it a lot, it's just not up there with my favorites.

The shave itself: 5 stars. Very smooth and very comfortable.

Would I buy again? Possibly. I use a lot of different shave creams and soaps and there are a lot more to try. I can say, however, that I will use this in my rotation at least until it is used up. This was absolutely not a waste of money. For those men who actually prefer a lesser-lathering soap or cream, this may actually be a 5 star buy for you. I can recommend trying it. Even if it ends up not being your favorite, you will use it all. It will not go to waste. The shave is too good to toss the product.",1
"Not for me but maybe for someone else.  I can see the technique may work better for certain people's balding issues but for me, it was too messy and I really needed something to cover the gray more than fill in balding spots.  The package was all beat up and looked like it had been used when I got it.  By that I mean the actual box it was packaged in...not the outside Amazon box...that was fine.",0
"I have used this product for many years, and it is great.",1
It smells incredible. I wish it had a pump. Really tough squeeze bottle.,1
Not at all the delicate pink I was expecting this very orange and dark.,0
"The title of this product should reflect that this is the BABY version. There is nothing in the title or description that indicates this, and if ordering on a phone, it's almost impossible to tell that it's the baby version.
The formula and consistency for the baby version and the regular version are not the same, so this DOES make a difference!",0
"The color was not good for me.  It was more transparent than I thought it would be.  However, I received the item quickly!  A good Halloween color!",0
"I like this lotion it does exfoliate okay, but I don't like the consistency of it. The pump on mine stopped working, I have to open it to try and scrape the thick/glue like lotion out. I want to keep using this if they ake a thinner consistency.
I will use this and add some lactic acid to it /and a thinner glycolic lotion to try and make it easier for it to glide on my body.

Besides the feel of this treatment lotion, I think it does a pretty good job at exfoliation.",1
The palette is very nice.  Colors are formulated well.  Only 4 stars because the packaging was terrible and my palette mirror was broken in transit/during shipping.,1
"This is not the real product. I compared the ingredients to the old bottle I had that I bought from Ulta and it is different. The smell is also different, and it is not a clear formula like the original.",0
I thoughtthis would help spread Toppik material evenly but instead it shoots it out in a narrow tight pattern. This may be ok if you are trying to cover a few small spots but for larger areas you'll end up with a dark dot on your skin every time you squeeze it. I'd recommend sprinkling from the ca without it.,0
Really great product. I recommend it,1
Smells horrible and does not do anything for your skin. Leaves a greesy feel. Would not recommend.,0
"One of the easiest ways to determine if a review is applicable is to know a little bit about the reviewer. Since this is a hair product, I suppose you need to know about my hair!

I have very fine hair, somewhat brittle, but with body. Not true curl, but definitely body that makes it flip every which way. A straightener is really the best tool for getting my hair to lay smoothly all in one direction. While I do not need the highest heat settings for my fine hair, nor does it take me long to straighten it, it does take a bit of work to tame my stubborn hair at times.

So, with that being said, how does this straightener measure up? In short, I love it!

A little more specifically:
- The heat settings are great for fine hair, handling my stubborn flips while still protecting my hair from being overheated and damaged.
- The grip is nice. It's easy to use, and I don't feel like I'm going to burn my head with every pass.
- It locks well, which is handy for travel.

Now, for the cool mist. It comes with two sample packets, each of which completely fills the cool mist tank. So far I've been using this straightener six or seven times (over the course of the last two weeks), and I've used about half of the tank. Do remember that I have fine hair, so I only need to separate my hair into a couple of layers to get the job done. So, I don't know how long the tank would last for someone who needs to invest a great deal of time into straightening.

The liquid itself leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable rather than coarse and frizzy. My fine strands are so easily damaged that I'll take any help I can get to actually use the straightener and still protect my hair!

So, my biggest complaint? I can't find the Macadamia Conditioning Oil anywhere! I really wanted to price it to see how economical it was to continue using the oil rather than distilled water, but there is no way to search for the price, that I can find. So, once my two tubes are gone, I will have to switch to distilled water. I haven't tried it with water yet to see how my hair feels, so it might be that the cool mist alone - even with water - is enough to keep my hair soft and protected. But I'd still like to know how to get the oil and how much it costs.

Bottom line - I quickly set aside my old straightener for this one, and I haven't looked back. I love it, even if I can't buy any more of the conditioning oil!",1
"I do hair for a variety of people.  One of the people I have worked with for a long time has hair that is thick and frizzy, but on humid or hot days, the hair is CRAZY.  It is color treated and borders on being dry, although not always.  I also do hair for another person who has straighter hair but wants to have shiny and ultra straight hair.  I got this brush to use with both of them to see if we could do some new looks with their hair.

WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?
The brush comes in a box which has a hole in one side and you push and the box slides out.  Sounds silly, but it took me a bit to figure that out since I started with the other sides of the box first.  Inside is the brush with a warranty card and a brief instruction sheet.  The brush itself is a slick handle.  On the back of the handle is an on off pad which you press.  The first setting is the 320F setting and the power button blinks when it first is turned on.  There are three other settings.  To get to them you press the power button briefly and it will change temperature.

The bristles of the brush are arranged in such a way that it will discourage tangles and work through them more easily than other brushes.  The bristles on the outside are plastic but the inside ones are ceramic.  These are all different heights, staggered so that they will handle long hair more easily.  The cord is a heavy round cord and the plug is a polarized plug (on prong is wider than the other).

HOW IS THIS BRUSH TO USE?
I found that when I turn on the brush, the power light flashes and the first temperature is 320.  It says to lock in temperature, that you have to press and hold for 2 seconds.  For me, it just stayed at the temperature and I did not have to hold it.  To move it up, I simply pressed the power button and it changed.  Then you press quickly until you either get a new temperature or you turn the unit off.  I am thinking that the setting of the temperature is so that if your hand slips while using the brush, you won't accidentally have it higher than you want and not know it.  I did not have a problem with that, however.

The brush takes about 2 minutes to heat up.  At first the power light blinks when it is turned on.  When ready to use and up to temperature, the power light turns green and you are ready to go.  The cord gives plenty of length to use freely even if you are not on top of an outlet.

The brush slides through the hair quite easily.  You pull it slowly through a section of hair- not a huge section- and then move on to the next one.  The first hair I tried it on was tangled, had not been combed all day and was frizzy as could be.  It looked wild.  The brush slid through the hair VERY easily.  I set it at 320 and it was perfect.  The hotter temps made it too straight.  320 made it so that the surface was very smooth, there was still a small wave, but it was shiny and beautiful.  Frizz was gone.  Once the entire head was done, I dampened my hands and gently squeezed the hair all over to set in some wave.  The effect was beautiful.  The hair is feathered and long but tapered with multiple layers.

The second hair I used it on had a slight wave but is pretty much straight.  It also was color treated.  350 and 400 seemed to work better for this hair.  It is medium fine, but to get a good shine and straightening, the higher temperatures worked better.  This hair was not dry or fragile but quite sturdy.  The effect was a great shine and straightening and made this person very happy.  Color was accented and the shine was really nice.

WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE
My only problem with this brush is that it was hard to hold on to.  The handle is slick and I found myself almost dropping it a few times.  I would prefer a handle that had some sort of gripping ability on it, a bit thicker than the one that is on there so it is easier to hold and manipulated through the hair.  This one is a bit too slick.  For that, I take off one star.

THE BOTTOM LINE
For frizzy or straight hair with a slight wave, this brush gave a great shine and eliminated frizz. It only takes about 2 minutes to heat up.  Depending on temperature used, the effect can still leave some body or you can go poker straight.  The settings are easy to do and seemed to be easy to keep in place.  You can lock settings so you don't accidentally change it while using.  Tangled hair seemed to be no problem for this brush as it slides right through if you go slowly.  If you can stand the slick handle, this is a great brush.  It has versatility to it and so far the people I have used it on really like how it performed on their hair.

I give this four stars because of the slick handle, but it is more like four and a half since the brush itself worked so well on the different types of hair I used it on.",1
"Has kind of an offensive smell, like burning hair. Used religiously for several weeks and saw no change. Didn't hurt anything, or make my PIH worse, but it didn't really help either.",0
"I love Mario Badescu skincare products! This eye cream is great, it definitely plumps out the angry red lines I wake up with on the sides of my eyes from sleeping on my side. The only caveat is that you have to be EXTREMELY careful not to get it too close to the corners of your eyes and you can't use it on the eyelid or it will cause weird blurry vision like all day long.",1
"I had never used a Mario Badescu product until I bought this lotion. I'm very impressed with it! It smells great and works wonderfully. A little bit goes a long way, which is nice, it isn't watery and it leaves my skin with a silky feeling. Will definitely order again.",1
"I like the color I don't really love the color. It doesn't seem to go on well. The brush feels very light and spreads out, painting the finger, quite often. The color displayed in the online ad was much more purple than the color we received which is more sooty than what we expected. We did discover an interesting combination finish using this as a base coat and then lightly over brushing with a hot-pink letting the two colors randomly show though. That effect was quite stunning. We did try carefully putting three coats on (no sealer, we were out) and the color wasn't horrible just still not the color expected. I'm sure the right occasion will come along where this will look right.",1
Good idea.,0
"Wanted to love these but actually glad I hate them because they are pricey. Granted, I have a pretty sensitive nose, but the smell of these is just awful and I can't wait until I run out of these. Way too strong-scented.",0
Seems to keep the polish on alot longer than normal polish.  I would purchase again.,1
Does what it is described to do.,1
It tastes like perfume. Stick with the plain mint flavors.,0
"OMG!!  My face was so so dry, I thought it was going to crack.  Tried this cream and after one application, my face was so much better.  Great product.  I want to buy the eye cream, but it's very expensive.",1
"We live in a trailer on a ranch near the ocean (I know it sounds great, it is) and therefore have some of the most hard water my poor hair and skin has ever experienced. I bought this product hoping it would be a partial solution. Unfortunately it didn't make any different at all. I ended up buy-in Tres'eme shampoo and conditioner and it made my hair 10x softer than this product. I also wasn't a huge fan of the fake citrus smell.",0
When looking at polish color in photo online polish appears to be a bright turquoise.  When applying polish it is a bit translucent.  I applied it thicker to get the color closer to the bottle.  Came out pretty good.  I thought it would have been too thick to apply 2 coats.  Great packaging.,1
"Didn't enjoy this product at all!  So much menthol. After a few uses, my usually dry lips where cracking and drier than they were before use.",0
Great product.  Less money/expense  then Wen,1
"Thank you, arrived safely in Italy! :)",1
Not really waterproof as it describe it.,0
"I was not a fan of this palette.  The eyeshadows are not that pigmented and a bit...thin, I guess?  I do like that everything you need to put together a ""look"" is right there, but the quality just isn't up to par, especially for $59.  I think em's chiaroscuro (sp?) stick and their lipsticks are the best from this brand.",0
works great!,1
"Shower Gel bubble is very much, the effect is not so obvious",1
"It's a fake brush, don't order just go and get your self a real one it makes a big difference on your skin, this brush was enlarging my pores. I went and  got a real one from Ulta and after 3 days my pores are much smaller. So don't buy it.",0
"For now only using once a day, but plan to increase to twice.  It is not as harsh as a peel, like 30% that I have tried.  This may be the single best item I have ever purchased that produces immediate recognizable improvement in complexion.  I am also using Prosacea with great results.  Pairing these two together has just been phenomenal.  And it is much more economical than some other brands that are more than twice as expensive and over a third fewer pads.",1
"Beware the bottle was delivered without a seal and is not returnable.

I would not feel comfortable putting the product on my face packaged like this - who knows what's in the bottle...",0
I purchased these as Christmas gifts as well as some other purse perfumes.  These 3 arrived in damaged boxes and some of the contents seem to be missing.  Not happy - too late to do anything about this!,0
This is nothing special. Its not thick like oil. Its runny like water. The smell is a little too strong to go on the face. I ended up having to put another moisturizer on over this one. I won't be buying it.,0
"""Pixie dust"" ends up feeling and looking like sand paper with a bit of glitter.",0
Love this shampoo,1
"The best cream ever!  Amazing texture, incredible scent and the results are exactly as described!!",1
"update 3/10/2017:  I have used about 90% of this product.  I cannot see any difference or improvement in circles, wrinkles or spots.

I like the formulation:  It is a light cream in a pump.  No smell at all that I notice (yay).  I wear it morning and night and it did not irritate or dry.  This would not be a moisturizer for most people, but is perfect for me, since I really don't need a moisturizer and have bought serums in the past.  I am at the age where I need a little more heft to my skin products and this seems like a perfect consistency.

I'm targeting my under eye circles/lines and a particular sunspot.  I will update over time if I see the great results I'm seeing from other reviewers.",1
"The original Pureology products are great, but I have a strong suspicion that the sellers on Amazon
water down the product. The bottles I received were not filled up as high as the ones I had purchased
in the salon. Although you might save a few bucks buying this through Amazon, you can't be sure you
are getting the actual product. In a beauty salon, or in a store like Ulta, you will get the real deal.
Also, in the past Pureology had parapbens. I'm not sure, but I think they are now making this paraben free
so check to be sure.",0
"Very disappointed that this polish was a weekly polish instead of real shellac.  This is the second time this has happened to me.  IT will not happen again that's for sure. IF I wanted regular nail polish I would not pay $10 for it as I can get regular nail polish much cheaper. VERY disappointed with false advertising.
Judith Stacey",0
Didnt work as expected. Nails chipped fast,0
Always holds and never tacky. Its the best i have ever used.,1
Color beautiful.  Goes on smooth with no clumps.  It is a deeper color pink. I really like it.  I used it with white and it looks more pink when used with lighter colors.,1
Love the smell. One of my top favorites!,1
"It may be just me and my lack of hair savvy but this product comes out thick and isn't easy to spread into hair evenly to use but is a thick powder and can give lift at top of head when needed, thats all I tend to use it for but otherwise tends to sit in my drawer",0
"Maybe in a darker shade this would be more effective, but with the light blonde, it didn't actually fill in any spaces, just wafted around my very thin hair without camouflaging anything.  I could still see my scalp!  Wasted money on the brush too - it's the same size as a bronzer brush so too big for small filling in along a center part.  Very disappointed.",0
This mascara looks the same as other over the counter ones when you apply it first. THEN when it dries little pieces that look like hair start falling on your face! It is so annoying! I get the same look from the ones that are half the price without having to constantly check to see if I have to pick another piece of whatever that is off my cheek. I would stick to the ones I buy at the drugstore.,0
"I first tried the soy lotion from a friend and loved it. She ended up giving me a bottle for Christmas and now I have to keep my husband from using it! It smells very fresh and not like perfume. It's not greasy and leaves your skin feeling amazing! If you haven't tried it, you are missing out!",1
It arrived shattered and all broken.,0
Works great....,1
I love this body wash. I only wish it came in a bigger size and wasn't so expensive.,1
WORKS WELL. PUMPS ARE DEFECTIVE,1
I buy this product regularly butt this was the first time with this buyer. I always buy once open a new bottle so I had it four months before using it. The consistency is like water...not the serum it is supposed to be...and what I usually receive. I demand a complete refund.,0
"Great moisturizing foundation, just need to pick a lighter color.",1
thank you,1
"There are three main possible problems with this eye area: puffiness, dark circles and wrinkles.  I don't have puffiness or wrinkles, but I do have dark circles.  A dermatologist told me dark circles were mostly genetic and there's really nothing you can do about them (even surgery isn't very effective) except apply concealer.

This serum doesn't do anything for them either.  I can feel it's tingly, and tightening, so if I had puffiness or wrinkles, I think it would make a difference.  However, I think my dermatologist is correct about the dark circles.  I think I'll just have to live with them!",0
I used some of this product before and it was really strong and you had to be careful of it drying your skin. this stuff seems more diluted and is not strong or drying at all. doesn't work nearly as fast as stuff I've used in the past.,0
"I researched new flat irons for weeks before my $100 Wigo died after only a few years (don't buy one of those).  This flat iron had really good reviews and the few 3 star reviews it had weren't really all that bad.

The design is sleek and it seems solid and well made.  The recommended temperature range for my type hair (fine) was too low, so when I first tried the recommended heat setting of 230 degrees or so, it didn't work.  Once I bumped up the temperature to 400 degrees, it worked like a charm.

This flat iron heats up fast and my hair did not snag on it like it did with my Wigo.  I felt the price was very reasonable too.

I love this flat iron and would recommend it.

One star knocked off for the packaging...its totally unnecessary to tie strap the flat iron into the moulded plastic package and then in another box.  I had difficulty cutting the tie straps and ended up scratching the flat iron because I had to squeeze my scissors in between the tie strap and the flat iron.",1
"I have dark thick hair, this bottle made my hair super thin and fuzzy. Magic in a bottle? Sure, but it's dark magic. :((((",0
"Ewg.org has a definitive guide on sunscreens. It states categorically that you should avoid Sunscreens with Oxybenzone. L'Oreal invented Mexoryl SX and this does not list it in the ingredients. I have not used it, but will not, or other Anthelios products, for that reason.",0
"I love this curling iron, however, it is about my fifth one as the spring on the clamp tends to loosen with use.  When the clamp is not tight smaller amounts of hair are not held effectively and they just fall off of the barrel.  Hot Tools supplies an extra spring to install when this happens, but then the replacement spring loosens.  Consequently, I just purchase another as I've never found another brand of curling iron that works as well for me (when the clamp is tight).",1
The product came in cracked.,0
"This is the second fragrance that I've used from Burberry and this is just as lovely as the first one. Burberry Touch comes in a cool box that is unique and the bottle itself is simple yet beautiful. I love the smell, I could smell the woody elements in it. Two small spritzes (one one each arm) were enough to last most of the day. It might be on the stronger side for some people, so I don't recommend going overboard with spraying yourself-a little will go a long way.

Overall, I'm very happy with this perfume.",1
"I do like the hold, fragrance, and the fact it is mostly matte in finish. Although with time and with natural oils in your hair, it doesn't smell as fresh at the end of the day, which is understandable. The only downside to this is the pomade clumps your hair, and doesn't keep the strands fully separated. I might go back to Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream afterwards, or even Dove Men hair styling paste.",1
I work out and when my sweat mixed with these fibers i found that the color bled out of them.  I had to run to the bathroom several times to wipe away the dark green streaks that were making their way down my face.  Similar products that I have tried did not have this contraindication.,0
Never dried on my nails.,0
"We use several kneipp products but lavender is our favorite. The others  are fine also, we try them all, but we always like
lavender the best.",1
"3c/4a coil curls.

It has a pleasant, neutral scent. It smells like baby to me. It is clear and gel-like. That's all that I like about it, really.

I tried this on a large section of my own hair before putting it on my whole head. I do this for any new hair product to make sure it won't dry out my whole head if my hair does not like it. That is exactly what happened with this particular shampoo. I only used the tiniest amount, and focused it all on my scalp. When I rinse, I let the shampoo rinse over my hair while rubbing my scalp clean, so that I don't use too much product on my curls. I could immediately tell my hair was drying out. I didn't like the feeling. I checked in the mirror ad my curls were dry. I immediately co washed with a conditioner.

I am returning this bottle to Ulta, where I purchased from. I would love to keep it since I like the scent and consistency, but if using such a small amount and only focusing on my scalp dries out my hair that much, it is not worth it.

*Only buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons paulmitchell(dot)com lists. Otherwise you risk buying fake, old, or tampered product.",0
"It will not have effect immediately, need to wait 2-4 weeks to see the difference before and after. Need to use together with other acnes cream for my back and chest. The acnes breakouts decrease a lot but not totally go away",1

"Bad product,  like a no original...",0
"I am deeply concerned that this product is not the same as the other product I purchased while on vacation. My skin is not reacting the same to this product and isn't moisturizing the same as the other bottle I had. As you can see from the picture, the ingredients list is different which is odd and perplexing. I wrote the makers of Elemis and they haven't replied to my e-mail.",0
"I bought 3 colors: Step Right Up, Samoan Sand and Alpine snow. The Alpine snow worked well for French Manicures. The other two are pretty color's but almost impossible to apply evenly.  When I first opened the bottles the polish was thin and streaked but before I finished the first coat on all my nails it started to thicken.  By the time I finished the second coat it was gloppy and unusable!  I haven't used OPI in quite a while so maybe they changed the formula?  It used to be great polish. I won't be buying again.",0
Infinite shine is terrible. Starts chipping within one or two days. Not shiny at all! :( don't waste your money!,0
"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOOOOOVEEEE!!!!!! I use this powder above my cheekbone for contour and it is so pretty! It does not last as long as I wish it did :-( If it would last at least 6 hours, it would've received 5 stars. I do highly recommend for anyone looking for a lighter, yet sparkly highlighter for contour makeup.",1
Curls don't last more than 2 hours,0
I just received this and had to try immediately. I must say I could not believe the powdery substance that came off my face afterwards. Guess that was dry skin which I have very badly. I feel like I have just buffed my face and it feels awesome. Applied my moisterizer cream and I feel great! I also just bought Ultra Collagen Booster on Amazon to Add to my collection for the face. I am 43 and a Smoker for years and I do not want to look old so time to get busy with these products. Just one time I used it so far and I must say I love it and I was aggressive with it too! This ole face can handle it!!! DO not like things injected into my face such as Botox Etc..I want to be natural and do the right properly measures for my skin. ANother great thing to exfoliate the skin is coffee grounds mixed with Virgin olive oil just started that one for 2 weeks now and talk about refreshing and plumps up your face! Just need these smoker lines gone!!! Working on it and so far almost gone not as deep as they were. Just one time so far with this PMD but I can say I am sure I will look stunning after a month of use.  Highly Recommend:),1
"I don't have a very thick beard, and my neck whiskers grow in all the wrong directions, and I have terribly sensitive skin. But I switched over to the Schick Hydro and started using this shaving soap. I shave last in the shower, and this soap is amazing. I use about a marble's worth at a time, because it really lathers up nicely with just a little to start, and midway through I can always go back over for a second pass simply by rubbing my hands on my face and bringing more of the soap back to life before the final wash-off. Essentially, my last bowl lasted about 9 months, and would have been a little longer if it hadn't taken a few shaves to get used to how little soap I actually need, as well as setting some aside in my travel kit. Can't recommend this enough!",1
"They say, ""Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me."" Well, I wish I had took that into consideration when I purchased this hair dryer. I had the ""BaByliss Pro BABP6685N Porcelain Ceramic Carrera2 Dryer"" that shorted and quit working after about 9 months of use. I replaced it with this model, and after THREE months, the dryer blows only cold hair (e.g. the heating mechanism - and entire reason for needing this product - does not work). There is a warranty and I plan on at least getting a replacement so that I don't feel like I've entirely wasted my money, but I will be buying a different brand and model. DO NOT BUY BABYLISS. Bottom line. One defective item? Bad luck. Two in a year? That's just poor craftsmanship.",0
Product was damaged when I received it. The top was completely snapped off of the bottle and the product leaked out all over.,0
"I've only had this hair dryer for about a month, but so far it works great. My hair dries much faster, and I think it feels softer. Also, it hasn't tripped a breaker or blown a fuse which were both a concern with our wiring. I wish that the cord was retractable. That is a feature that I really liked on my old blow dryer. This one has plenty of length, but it can be a pain to store.",1
You will love the smell if you like their moisturizer. Find it easier to serve both purposes.,1
"Good, long-lasting lipstick.  Sent on time",1
"I love this product!  It smells fabulous and goes on very smoothly.  It gives a very sheer cover but seems to give pretty good sun protection.  Also, it doesn't cause breakouts - and my skin is very prone to them.",1

One section of the shimmer brick arrived crumbled. Package was covered in the powder. Too much trouble to return item.,0
I have tried this product for the first time and I have been using it for about 2 weeks now.  So far I have not had any allergic reactions and it actually works well.  However if you are in the sun especially in the Caribbean you would need to reapply a few time a day for best results. I would purchase this product again.,1
"I've used this product for some time now and like it. However, it is usually a bit expensive for my budget, so I was happy to find is here for considerably less than other sites I have purchased it on. I was concerned that it might be old product, but when I received it I checked with my sister, who had recently gotten a new bottle herself. All the dates & codes were the same, so I am assuming it is not some aged product. Looks and feels the same as usual. This is a lightweight, not greasy moisturizer that is just right for my 70 year old skin. I am often complimented on how nice my skin looks and I give much of the credit to Replenix products.",1

"I have been using this product daily since April 1, not only did I not see a difference but my nails have never been more soft and brittle.  I used as directed so Im not sure why it didn't work for me.",0
"I am disappointed I bought this product. I hoped that it would exfoliate the skin, thus aiding in the fading of post acne marks. Unfortunately I experienced no results with this, even when I used it every night for several months. This led me to searching reviews online to see what others have experienced. I found out on Paula's Choice that this product contains so little glycolic acid that it's ineffective, and the pH is not in the range that would allow the acid to work properly on the skin even if there was enough of the acid. This explained why I was experiencing no results. The grapefruit and aloe vera in the product doesn't help my acne either (which one thinks it would), which makes me wonder if this product is simply 99% water. This is a large waste of money. When I use this, nothing happens and my skin is the same as when I don't use it. I still have the majority of the bottle and don't think I'll ever be able to finish it up because it's an unnecessary step that doesn't benefit my skin at all. If you are looking for a product to exfoliate with glycolic acid, try Ren's Glycol Lactic Radiance Renewal Mask. That product actually works and results in bright skin. Don't waste your money on this!",0
"Very disappointed- for the price- no color pay off,  even used 'wet', does not saturate the intended area with color.
Have used with eye primer, no difference in the quality of this shadow.
 Also, a 'negative'= it is supposed to be for daytime/""matte"" BUT, indeed, the lighter shades do have 'shimmer'.
Bummer. Brush included is useless(too long and porous for eye application-I used my own professional grade brushes)-Case is nice.",0
"Excellent Blow Dryer. Best I have used at home thus far, as it dries my hair super fast. Salon quality, I highly reccomend this product.",1
"I have been suffering from moderate to severe cystic acne for about 10 years (I'm 30). I have tried many prescription and drugstore skin care options, have changed my diet and vitamin regimen as well. I am currently using the mario badescu glycolic acid toner, the mario badescu buffering lotion for spot treatment, dermadoctor ain't misbehavin' face wash and neutrogena oil-free moisture clear skin. My skin looks amazing. I will probably be changing the neutrogena moisturizer in the near future, but I think everything else is working great for me.

I started the face wash a couple months ago and did see a good improvement over the neutrogena acne wash I had been using. So I bought this thinking that for the price it should definitely be a great thing. I DID NOT NOTICE ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MONTH THAT I HAD BEEN USING THE DERMADR. FACEWASH BY ITSELF VS. WITH THE SERUM IN THE WHOLE 1.5 MONTHS THAT THE SERUM LASTED. I used it twice a day. Will not be using it again!!

I strongly suggest the Mario Badescu stuff, it is what inspired me to write these reviews today!!",0
Didn't fit on my blow dryer,0
"I've used these capsules for a month now and am overwhelmingly disappointed with the results.

The capsules are filled with thick, clogging oils that smell a bit off. I've noticed no results from the product except its unmatched ability to clog my pores.

Absolutely advise against using this if you have combination skin. I feel Elemis is heavily marketing this product because its unqiue and can generate high profits due to its absurd price. Consider purchasing natural flower/herbal oils instead. I do not trust these reviews posted and suspect a marketing campaign behind it.",0
"Pleasing fragrance,smooth application,2nd purchase",0
Had read reviews on Nail Envy in the past.  I had gotten some but forgot I had it.  Started using it about 3 weeks ago....love it!  It has improved my nails so much!  I will not be without this product ever again.,1
"I tried it several times, and it, and the ragged tooth comb Toppik peddles, are not worth the ridiculous prices Toppik charges for these useless items.  I use Toppik hair treatment and think it is modestly useful, but even it is over priced.  When I finish the container, I will try another similar product.",0
Smells really strong like a belk magazine with all the cologne and perfume scratch areas mixed together. Works well but can not stand the smell so won't be using.,0
"This fiber works well but the truth is this keratin fiber is extremely expensive per gram in comparison to fiber you can get on Ebay or here on Amazon from other vendors!....when you get down to it and strip the names off of these labels, you really only have two major options for realistic and natural looking hair fiber.  Gossypium Herbaceum Plant fiber (Caboki uses this) and Keratin Animal fiber (Toppik uses this)  They both are effective at providing natural looking hair coverage and most brands use one or the other of these 2 solutions....so it really only comes down to the cost to help you in your selection once you decide on which type of solution will work best for you.
So to keep things in perspective, Toppik is one of the MOST expensive solutions when you can get a product of equal caliber for alot, alot less per gram.  For example, you can purchase 75grams of another brands Plant fiber for the same price of 12grams of the Toppik and get the same results.

Trust me on this please as I have a bald spot in my crown the size of a monk and I've tested about 8 different companies and found very little difference in about 6 of the 8 products I've tried.

Among some of the ones tested:

Toppik
Caboki
Samson Hair FIber
Follic Tech
X Fusion
Finally Hair
Hair Squared
Westwood Hair

There may be a few more...but for the most part they are all very similar in performance and I wouldnt be surprised if they almost all came from 1 or 2 main factories.  Dont be fooled by the marketing.....get the stuff that is the cheapest and just refill the shaker bottles and you'll be looking sharp in no time",0
"I read the reviews, and since they are mostly positive, I thought I'd give this lip stain a try. I bought ""Liquid Kiss,"" and though darker than the color as represented on the Vincent Longo website, at least as my monitor renders it, it is still lovely.

The Pros: lovely color, evenness of color easy to achieve, easy application, dries fast, does not get on teeth, no taste

The Cons: color gone very quickly (too quickly), makes lips very dry

I've worn this three different times, and all three times, the color was gone within an hour. No, I didn't eat or drink anything. Each time I wore it, I used different amounts of stain to achieve different depths of color, but how much I used did not matter: a little or a lot, it was gone in an hour. I also used lip gloss on top of it during one wearing (this lip stain really dries out the lips; it goes on cool, which suggests the presence of alcohol).

I want to love this lip stain; the ""Pros"" I listed above are the very things I'm looking for. But lasting so short a time just won't cut it for me. I'm a fix-up and go sort of person; I don't like high-maintenance make-up. I don't want to have to repeat applications throughout the day. Sure, after a meal, a touch-up is sometimes necessary, but this lip stain hardly makes it through the morning commute.

If you don't mind the need for possible hourly re-application, and if you have a gloss to help with the drying, then this might be the product for you. As I noted above, it's a great stain in many ways. It just doesn't last long enough to be practical for me.",0
Smells nice and musky. Kinda reminds me of an auto body repair shop. The cream was silvery and shiny so that's pretty cool Packing was a little rough and crumpled but i didn't mind.,1
It chipped 4 hours after I used it. Was pretty disappointed.  Really wanted to try it bcuz I love nail polish but it never lasts,0

"Do NOT buy this piece of junk! Just a few days after the Amazon return period expired, the rubberized finish began to break down, leaving a sticky mess on the handle. It appears that this could be a counterfeit unit as Ive seen other CHI units that did not have the rubber finish. I would expect a $10 curler/iron to perhaps behave this way, but an $80 unit?!

The locking ring also jams and the unit falls apart frequently. Of course I only hear about it when the finish goes tacky.

Save your money, don't buy this poorly made excuse for a high end CHI curling iron.",0
"I first bought this product from a licensed esthetician upon her recommendation.  I loved it, but couldn't afford to spend another $80 for a jar.  I found it on Amazon for considerably less, from a reputable seller.  It's worth it.  My neck is really just starting to get lines and loose elasticity and I use this daily and nightly.  I'm generous with how much I apply and spread it over my dcolletage, but I'm careful around my jawline, as it tends to breakout with most moisturizing products. It's possibly the best neck firming product in its price range.  La Prarie or Guerlain have similar products in the $350 range!",1
"This did not work for my sun spots or pregnancy mask I got. I used it for over a year. After reading the bottle where it states ""if no improvement is seen after 3 month of treatment, use of this product should be discontinued"". I was very disappointed that it didn't even touch my problem area.",0
"I've never used a Mario Badescu product, but have seen the brand get a lot of good reviews. Maybe I just have bad luck, but this facial spray is terrible! Not even 5 minutes after spraying it on, my face started itching and burning. I ended up washing it off after a few more minutes, and my face was red and irritated the rest of the night. I will be returning it. The nozzle doesn't work well and sprays big droplets out.",0
"Disappointed,  left my hair flat",0
The women love it.  I have not yet met a woman who doesn't.  That's all that needs said.,1
Overpriced. Disappointed.,0
"It does what it says, it smooths the hair nicely, but the smell is pretty strong for the first half hour after putting it on.",1
Paid to much,0
Not very pigmented.  I have eye shadow that is more effective,0
"Makes my hair feel dirty, causing me to wash every day, rather than ever other day, as I typically do",0
"The quality of the conditioner is average. This product has a strong scent, like an unpleasant perfume -- not something that you would expect for a leave-in conditioner.",0
"I had this cologne back in the 90's , this one is fake",0
Didn't notice a difference.,0
Great Color. Zoya is a great brand of nail polish. Definitely love this color.  I hope they don't discontinue this color.,1
"I emptied the whole sample at one go and that was a mistake. The texture is very thick, so this sample could easily last two to probably even three uses. In order not to waste, I smeared the whole thing onto my face, neck, and some on the arms. This product smells so bad! At first, I wonder if I was applying cleanser on my face because that's what this product smells like. I wouldn't buy this product personally.",0
"Sometimes I'll put this on instead of mascara. As long as you wait for it to dry before you leave the house (when it's wet it's a bright white color), it makes your eyelashes look great and is a perfect accompaniment to tinted chapstick for a day when you don't want to wear makeup but your face wants a little pick me up. If you wear makeup every day, this also makes your eyelashes look nicer in the morning if you put it on at night before bed. I wouldn't use it every single night though because it caused irritation when I used it more than 3x per week.",1
"With so many mineral powders available this product is often overlooked in lieu of those with tinting. Let me just say STOP and HIGHLY consider this instead of any others! First off the sunscreen is excellent and a ""physical block"" versus just a chemical block. Second, it doesn't add color or ""foundation-like"" effects on your skin... meaning no smearing, orange or brown color... just a subtle soft focus effect... nice! Those with good skin can use this over moisturizer (I do) and look flawless. If you have a couple of flaws, I'd recommend a concealer versus any other make-up... since this combo will give you moisture, sunscreen and a flawless yet natural finish. One note, on this and all other physical block sunscreens... they add a reflection to your skin due to the metals in them. Most photographers will want you to use a matte product in photos. If you're having pictures taken that day, don't wear this... you'll appear shiny even if you're not.",1
I've been on the hunt for a good blemish/sun spot reduction cream for awhile. I have high confidence in Epicuren products so I was hopeful I might see some positive results with this. I used the whole bottle but it unfortunately didn't do anything. Not worth the money.,0
"This aftershave is great.

I do notice a little of that ""aloe residue"" feel.  It's not horrible, but I do notice it now and again throughout the day.  That's just me.

I think it's tad pricey, but it's a great product and certainly cheap enough to try once.  Who knows - it may be your favorite and worth every penny!",1
"I enjoy this products for traveling. the shaving cream itself is very good, but sometimes I don't think they put the right amount of product into the packaging as it really goes fast. so maybe not worth the money Vs. amount.",1
"This is gong to be a rather subjective review. When it comes to fragrances people either tend to like them or hate them. That's what this fragrance is like. It's a bit strong so if you don't like strong fragrances you're not going to like this. On the other hand, if you like stronger, uplifting fragrances this is perfect. It almost smells as if it has a hint of cinnamon and other spices and an apple undertone. That's just me. Any fragrance you use on your hair or body is going to interact with your own chemistry and you'll either love the smell or hate it. In my opinion, this is a great scent for those frumpy, tired days when you need an uplifting fragrance to enhance your mood and make you smell good. I especially like it after being around someone who has been smoking or other odors that tend to stick to your hair, clothes, and skin. This takes care of the lingering odor right away. Also, a little goes a long way with this product. One or two spritzes and you're done. Don't overdo it or you'll be regretting it for hours as the fragrance lasts quite a while.",1
Love this brand of polish and this color.  Great color for the summer.,1
"I first found this tanning oil at a gift shop at the St Regis hotel in Bal Harbour, Miami. It is absolutely amazing and totally worth the price! It smells divine and does NOT leave your skin feeling slimy like every other tanning oil. I keep buying it every time I run out. My husband loves it too!",1
Bottle too small,0
Broke me out.,0
Not as good as. reported. Can be messy when combing hair.,0
I was disappointed with this mascara I have tried other brands like Revlon Maybelline which outperform it,0
I have used the equalizer for several years and liked it; but this one has a pump that does not work;  I have to pour it out of this bottle into another one to use.,0
Great quality,1
Unfortunately the reason why this product doesn't have an expiration date is because it doesn't have the Hydroquinone in it! That's what actually lightens the skin of you have hyperpigmentation due to sun exposure. Wish they would have mentioned in the description. It's confusing that Obagi has 2 very similar products labeled the same way but one with the Hydroquinone and the other without it.,0
"Great product, had to take one star off because it was a bit heavier than expected and heavier than my previous hair dryers, so if you have long hair and are holding this up for quite some time, your hand might get tired.",1
"I've used the product for years, it's gentle on the skin and it works better than other eye make-up removers. The only other version I prefer is the Klorane eye make-up remover Lotion.",1
I am not sure that this is the original product.  Container is labeled differently when received.  My opinion:  the product is not as creamy as my last purchase of this in a salon.,0
"Very disappointed with this product! The cream and exfoliant were very good and the mitt was helpful, but the actual tanning solution did not work even after three applications.  Sorry, don't waste your money!",0
"This is  the ONLY product that HAS EVER worked on my hair. I had been thinning out for maybe 2 years now. I had tried everything from home remedies to buying different things on amazon. I used this for maybe a month and started noticing the difference. LADIES ( & GENTLEMAN) THIS PRODUCT IS REALLY WORTH THE TRY!! i don't usually leave long reviews but this product deserves it..... every night i would massage a little bit on the left side of my edges and right side ( the main parts i lost hair ), and in the morning i would do it too and style accordingly ( plus a whole lot of prayers ) and my hair, after 2 yrs, is now growing back!!! if you're indecisive about this product JUST BUY IT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF!!! i will be recommending this product to everyone i personally know!! if it worked for me i KNOW its going to work for you. try it for at least a month religiously, night and morning. ALSO in the morning while styling my hair for work i noticed that after putting the treatment my hair would get a little stiff in the parts i applied. So i started putting a tiny bit of coconut oil ( just a tiny bit to soften it ) then i would style it!!  PS. I HAVE NEVER LEFT SUCH IN DEPTH COMMENT !!  MUST BUY if you're thinning out!!",1
"I used to love Super Goop but they changed the formula, I think.  It is now super stinky and the consistency is strange - runny and not lotion-like.  Its a shame because I have had three of these pumps over the last couple of years but I'm not buying again.",0
"I use a strait razor and got this for a clumsy friend, I tried it first and cleaned it before giving it to him. Anyway, works great. Moles and pimples aside, you pretty much have to be an idiot to cut yourself with this. Hefty design and will last forever if you take decent care of it. Clean, smooth, and effortless shave! (Besides, it looks classy in your bathroom when the ladies come over.)",1
"I have used this product in the past, it kept the razor burn from happening on my neck, which normally causes me to bleed.  Will be buying again....",1
"I received a sample tube of Ahava Time to Hydrate moisturizer and loved it.  It is not heavy and has a matte finish.  I was planning to order more, but decided to try Time to Smooth since it is described as age control.  I find it to be very heavy, shiny and greasy feeling, no matter how little I apply.  I have to blot my face with a tissue after applying and it's still shiny.  I'm going to use this as a night time moisturizer and buy what I intended to purchase in the first place.",0
The temperature control knob doesn't stay on the setting I put it at.  It continually moves to a different setting each time I twirl the curling iron.,0
I used this same color at the nail salon and loved it. However this polish seems very thin and takes 3 or more coats to polish. It is as if it had been diluted. Disappointed,0
All great thanks!,1
Do not waste your money.  It doesn't do what it promises.  It is just another cream.  You can save money by just purchasing a hand cream and putting that under your eyes.,0
"I can not get past the smell. It gives me an instant headache. Please, Please, Please make a fragrance free line. I typed in fragrance free and they offered some choices BUT they are not fragrance free if you read the ingredients. So disappointed. I need plumping!!!!!",0
Love love love it!  Makes my hair shiny and silky.,1
This item showed up partially unscrewed and the safety seal half peeled away and it looked half empty. Returned immediately.,0
"I have had to throw out 3 bottles of this spray now because the nozzle stops working after a few uses. What a waste of money. The spray is okay but I will not be purchasing more of it. I have wasted almost 3 full bottles. I have reached out to Rusk and am waiting to hear back from them. Based on reviews, I am not the only one this is happening to. The company must be aware that this is an issue.....but why does it keep happening??",0
"This was a little too heavy for my skin. It left me feeling my shiny and ""wet"" than moisturized. I'll just use this as a sunscreen instead of a daily moisturizer.",0
One of the best perfumes I used. I recommend this item for all men.,1
"MY HG!! It takes off everything and help me to fully cleanse my face using gentle cleanser afterwards. This is a gentle product and does not irritate my acne-prone, super oily Asian skin. I have been using it for 2 years now. Love it!",1
"I love this lotion! Soft skin, it does help to exfoliate and even out skin but that takes time whereas the softness came pretty quickly within a few uses!",1
"The Vichy ProEven Daily Dark Spot Corrector Cream is designed to tackle those skin tone by evening it out and improving the appearance of dark spots. As such it is suggested for optimal use to be used twice daily, otherwise it should be used at night on cleansed skin.

The product combines a resurfacing LHA with exclusive Ceramide Bright technology as well as containing an antioxidant Vitamin C which can protect skin from damage by free radicals. It also contains enriched mother-of-pearl to immediately blur imperfections and illuminate skin. This cream is free of hydroquinone- and paraben-free.

The product goes on pretty smoothly and is absorbed relatively fast and easily. Only after repeated use will any real change be noticed.",1
Love the entire product line. Great for sensitive skin.,1
"This had potential, but it was just too drying for my skin. It would go on fairly smoothly in the morning, but even with moisturizer under it, I found that within an hour or two my skin was flaking off. I've since learned that sunscreens with high percentages of zinc oxide can be drying. I think I'll be going back to my old CVS clear zinc sunscreen, which is more emollient and has a chemical sunscreen component in addition to the zinc.",0
"it works magic on your skin :)
its really works",1
"I have been using this product for over a year now and have, for the first time in my life, been receiving unsolicited compliments on my skin.  I don't like to waste money and this product is worth every penny.",1
"have been using this for our baby since the day he was born, we massage his body with the lotion after bath, he smells divine and also his skin is super soft.. never faced any issue of dryness or body rash with the lotion.",1
"Could be my imagination, but I swear this stuff works better at the salon.  It is too harsh for daily use on blonde hair.  It does help combat brassiness, and it smells wonderful....like lemon sorbet.",1
"These pads (used daily) did nothing for me. Moreover, they smell toxic.  Do not waste your money.",0
Not good for my skin.  Too irritating.  Leaves my skin looking like it has a rash.,0
"Pros:
Good Price for the Ahava brand

Cons:
As with most sunscreen; has a white cast if you have a dark complexion
Smells like sunscreen with perfume
Not moisturizing

FYI:
I have medium dark skin. This product may be moisturizing for someone with normal skin: i have combination skin.",0
"As in my other comments re Proraso, you cannot go wrong with this cream. Convenient and green package, it seems to last a long time, and hold it's lather well for a three pass shave.",1
Calms the frizzies and moisturizes my hair,1
Doesn't smell ... I'd put it up and nothing smells ..! :(,0
"This hairdryer is quiet, light weight, and dries hair quickly. It leaves your hair feeling soft but it isn't good for curly hair. That was the reason I purchased this dryer. If you have fine curly hair this dryer makes your curls frizzy.",0
I love this stuff!! I use it 1-2x's a week to get a deep clean on my face.  It makes my face feel incredibly smooth and clean afterwards and definitely prevents breakouts.  A little goes a long way!! Worth every penny.,1
Original product delivery in right time.,1
Sought this out for gluten free shampoo and love the salon quality. Extremely pleased.,1
Way too watery to put on easily. Returned.,0
I'm not sure if this is a real product. I've used this conditioner before and it was amazing. The one I've received through Amazon seems way different than one purchased in store. It makes my hair dull and coarse ( feels like hay ) ;(,0
This is a great product.  My lashes stopped falling out and are healthier.  Use it at night,1
"This is a winter regimen I do for my hands and arms.  Exfoliated area w/Buf-Puf first.  Used cream.  I expected slight redness on hands - bringing blood to surface. (Good for reducing lines) This is an 18% cream! Nothing.
Cream was thick & gooey - just lay on top of my skin blocking pores.
Useless.
I didn't even want to put my clothes on over it!
Then my arms got little bumps.
ByeBye cream!",0
"I got this as a gift for my wife and she gave me the following information.

It goes on very easily and dries quickly, while absorbing into the skin.  She says her skin feels much less dry immediately after and for longer than she expected.  The smell is not overpowering to her and she enjoys the scent, and I find it pleasant as well.  The amount of high quality rosewater in the spray for the price is reasonable.",1
"Smell is a little overbearing at first, but then it wears off quickly. Goes on great. Does not have the water proofing as I would like. It does hydrate and leaves hands, arms, etc. soft.",1
Smells very different from mine,0
This stuff smells soooooo good but I only got to use it once because I dropped it and it literally shattered. Buyers beware not to drop it or else your money will shatter along with it :(,0
Use this pretty box to hold makeup in a decorative mode.  This box has an old fashioned look to it.  Keeps the mess contained.,1
"I finally found the sunscreen that works so well. Coola goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. It feels light to the touch and cool on the skin compared to other sunscreens that are heavy and sticky, it doesn't make the white marks on your face. The only negative about it is when you have it on throughout the day, it eventually runs into the eyes which stings. I wished Coola made the same exact product without the sting.",1
exactly what I wanted,1
"Background: I am 61 and spent a lot of time in the sun as a teen.  I have a lot of fine lines around my eyes (eyelids and under eyes) and droopy eyelids.  I got a hard-sell recommendation for this product at the place where I get my Botox (supposedly the office of a dermatologist - he has Dr. in front of his name). They wanted me to buy it from them for $275.  Naturally, I wanted to try it somewhere cheaper first.

The Middleman Seller:  I don't have any reason to believe this isn't the real thing.  It arrived all sealed up and the red side was candy apple red.  It looks just like the product that my Botox shop showed me.

The Product: 1) The packaging is a blatant false-advertising gimmick - 1 ounce would fit in about 1/10 this size. 2) I did not detect a bad smell at all.  Maybe that's an indication that I didn't get the right product, but it just didn't smell that bad to me.  When my Botox clinic gave me a sample on my hand, it didn't smell bad to me then, either.  3) Yes, the nozzles don't work that great.  Store it upside down, tap it on your palm a few times before you use it.  Don't press down in the middle or you'll get nothing but the cream.  First press on the far right edge to get the red gel to come out and then press on the far left edge to get a matching amount of cream.  Wipe off the nozzles afterwards so they don't get clogged.  You might need to clear the holes with a pin when you first use it.  Frankly, pretty shoddy packaging for the price.

The Results:  I used this for 2 weeks, religiously day and night.  Only around my eyes, so just a dab of product.  After 2 weeks I did see some minor improvement to the wrinkles.  Maybe 30% to 50% better.  But my skin certainly wasn't smooth and wrinkle-free. And I still had droopy eyelids.  I've seen just as good results from far cheaper creams (like ROC or the Vitamin C creams).  If you're not looking in a magnifying mirror, like I was, I'm not sure anyone else would notice that much.

Conclusion: OK, but not worth the price.  Definitely not worth $275 and probably not worth $145.  If you look at the YouTube video (a talk show - I don't know which one), there's a guy sitting on stage in scrubs touting the product like he's some kind of medical expert.  Total hype.

I'll keep using this for 2 more weeks.  If I see startling improvement, I'll post here again.

--------------------

Update:  I continued to use TNS for another 3 weeks, morning and night.  I saw no additional improvement and my eyes were still wrinkly and crepe-y so I threw it out.  I tried Neutragena Rapid Wrinkle Repair and it made my skin burn and turn red and dry out badly (and I don't have sensitive skin).  About a week after that fiasco I started to use Image Vital C Hydrating serum all over my face and Image Ageless Eye Lift Creme around my eyes, at the advice of the person who does my facials.  She did not try to sell me the Image products, I bought them on Amazon, so I know it wasn't just product push.  This time I definitely saw obvious improvement in a week or so, with the fine crepe lines smoothing out a LOT and the puffiness diminishing somewhat (better but  not gone).  In fact, I am amazed at how much smoother the skin looks around my eyes.  Way better than TNS.  Image also moisturizes so my dry skin looks better and rosier all over.  Everybody's skin is different, but if you have old lady crepe-y skin around your eyes, I would definitely recommend Image.  I would now recommend Image over ROC.",0
Other than the steep price this is a great pre-shave product.  Also like the fact its in a plastic bottle makes it safer to apply in shower.,1
The product was leaking in shipment,0
Right away you can tell it is fake. I can't believe it's on Prime.,0
An Almond sized squirt of this stuff will do two face shaves or one long leg all the way. You choose,1
A little pricey,1
"When I first used the spray, it seemed to sorta make my skin glow, but now I honestly see no difference in my skin when I use this. If anything, my skin has gotten super dry since I started using the spray.
Probably not going to buy it again...",0
My wife did not like this product. It left her hair looking and feeling oily and thin.,0
The color is too orange.  I used dermablend in the past and liked it.  I should have chosen a different color I suppose,1
"This is the first review I have ever written but I spent a long time debating on buying the PMD because of the price. I am 42 and I'm getting great results. I'm already using the red discs that do hurt a little but it's worth it to me. The best surprise with this device is that I started using it on my teenage son because he just started developing a lot of acne.  He said the blue and then later the green discs didn't hurt at all. And the results have been remarkable. After the second use, his skin is totally clear. That makes me even happier than the good results I'm seeing with my skin.",1
I don't know if this did anything for my eyes except irritate it. Not for me.,0
Didn't realize what a tiny amount I was getting.  Next time I have to order the giant size!,0
Curls my hair but they fall out in 10 minutes.  Used it a handful of times and it broke.,0
"I have always went with Chi products, but after my 5th replacement I wanted a new brand. I freaking LOVe this straightner!! Very thin for easy travel, long enough cord that reaches far away, very long plates so I can straighten more of my hair than every before. It leaves my hair so soft and shiny. I'm never going with a chi again! I love this product. Also a 4 year warranty!!!! If you have second thoughts order his product !!! It is so worth the price!",1
"First of all, this product has much more of an orange tint to it than is normal, much too orange for my fair skin, and even too orange for my sister who is a couple of shades darker than I am. It doesn't apply very easy, as far as spreading evenly and requires you to apply it in a more caked on fashion which is very unappealing. Both myself, and my sister couldn't stand it, and it felt heavy on our face. I wouldn't recommend!",0
"This is a great palette! It shipped fast and was in perfect condition. The eyeshadow (everything really) stays on all day and the colors are awesome. I would definitely recommend this, especially for the price!",1
"I ordered this spray because it is highly recommended for fine hair. I have short, fine hair and this product didn't hold at all, much less add volume. In fact, this may be the worst volumizing spray I have ever used or purchased. I would not recommend purchasing this product to anyone.",0
"Great addition to any bubble bath.  Makes a relaxing scent that stays on your body after you leave the tub.  When applying oil or fragrance to you body, it does not clash or intrude, rather it seems to make other scents bounce more.  I would recommend this to those who like to relax in the tub.",1
"The tone is a bit more ""yellow"" than I would like for color, but otherwise it's a pretty good product.
It's main ingredient is sunblock, also known as Titanium Dioxide.  It's been tinted to a skin tone color, and it gives a little better than medium  ""coverage"" for blemishes and such.  Using titanium dioxide as a sunscreen with liquid foundation makeup is nothing new.
It does go on easily as it is liquid. Removal with a make-up wipe is easy.

They could make it even more perfect by making it non-comedogenic, (they could add some salicylic acid so it doesn't increase acne problems.) But do far, they have jumped only onto the sunscreen bandwagon.",1
Runs slightly louder than other trimmers. Works good. One Blade broken. Had to go buy a new blade for it bc I didn't want to send it back and wait for a new one bc I needed it immediately for work.,1
"Haven't actually used the product but floored that I received it a quarter empty. Really? $25 for a tiny bottle of hair oil and it's not even remotely full? I feel completely jipped, for that reason would not order again or recommend",0
"this item works great for all old people that need hair in your head, realy colors grey it is like life.",1
only wish it came in darker shades for my biracial granddaughter. Great product. Bought my 4 th tube,1
"I love the smell of this, but unfortunately I don't think it does anything. Iv used it as a hydrating mist during skin care routine, and I have also used it as a setting spray and again nothing. I don't have problematic skin so that could be the reason possibly oily skin would like this because I could see how it could be hydrating with out being too much. I love this line and wish this worked for me.",0
Feels great.  No scent.  Not greasy.  I have oily and acneic skin and have no problems with this moisturizer.,1
"I've suffered with dark circles under my eyes for a LONG time. I have basically every factor that can go into dark circles: hereditary, horrible allergies, high blood pressure, etc. So I've been looking for something, anything that can help alleviate that problem.

This product is not that thing. I saw literally no change after faithful use for weeks. Still dark as ever. Still puffy as well. It only managed in annoying me with getting my dark circles all moist. Nice smell though!

Avoid this product.",0
The iron itself is good. But I don't like the odd shaped barrel. I don't like the way it shapes the curls.,0
Poor quality-with every use hairs loosen and fall out.  My one from three years sgo is nice & tight but this new one is AWFUL!!!,0
My husband loves Billy Jealousy because it's cruelty free and the product itself is amazing!!!,1
Pretty colour but felt like sandpaper on lips.,0
"I HAVE USED NEOVA FOR OVER 2 YEARS.  I LOVED IT TILL I OPENED MY LAST ORDER OF FEBRUARY 2016.  THE NEOVA THAT CAME OUT OF THE TUBE WAS NOT THE SMOOTH CREAM THAT I EXPECTED.  WHEN I SQUEEZED THE TUBE, WHAT WAS EXPRESSED WAS A CLEAR LIQUID SUBSTANCE AND A SEPARATE BEIGE CREAM,  WHEN I SHOOK THE TUBE, IT MADE A FLUID SOUND LIKE SWISHING WATER  I WENT TO THE OTHER TUBE FROM THE SAME ORDER.  I SHOOK THAT TOO.  IT ALSO MADE A WATERY SLUSHY SOUND.  I HAVE BEEN SOLD OLD OUTDATED MERCHANDISE!!!!!!!  EVEM THOUGH THE EXPIRATION DATE WASW 2016/09 LOT 44976I
I WANT THE GREAT PRODUCT THAT I ORDERED.  AMAZON HAS AN OBLIGATION TO STAND BEHIND WHAT THEY OFFER FOR SALE",0
Worked good.  Would recommend it to others that have hard water.  My hair was pretty bad and it is getting back to normal.,1
Doesn't work at all.,0
"Decided to try something different, I usually use Rodan & Fields eye cream but it is so expensive. I waited until I used all the product before writing this review, but unfortunately no amount of this eye cream will make any change. I actually think it made my dark circles worse. Occasionally it would also make my eyes water uncontrollably if I got it too close to my eye. You get what you pay for.",0
It doesn't work well at all.,0
works ok not sure would buy again,1
Perfect gift,1
very pleasant aroma,1
I've been using this foundation for years now--I believe that although the picture looks like the older version of this makeup I received the new one. I have been hesitant to try the new version (even though I think the only change is the packaging--the lid is flat instead of rounded).  I received & the packaging was different however the foundation is the exact same as the one I've used for years. I'd also like to say that this retails at $45-$50 in department stores. I will continue to order this from amazon/this seller since they sell it at a much lower price & the shipping was very quick. It always arrives nicely packaged--I appreciate that they pad the box so that there is no chance of it cracking.,1
"I have been using this cream for about a year...Got it on a cruise, and the jar lasted about 8 months.  It is really light, not heavy.  I love it.",1
great conditioner & works very well with the shampoo!  i love both products & will continue to use as the condition of my hair has improved greatly & my highlights are lasting a really long time.  worth the price & great quality!,1
I don't feel like this increased set time for my polish at all and it ruined the integrity of the polish I used it on top of.,0
Wife loves this product. Amazon pricing versus the salon is wonderful,1
"Great hair dryer.  Worth the price.  A lot of air flow and although somewhat heavy compared to drugstore models, it seems like it will last much longer.",1
"Not sure if my hair doesn't like this conditioner of if the conditioner is bad. I have curly 3B hair, this dries it out instead of moisturize. I wish I could have ordered a sample first. I would not have purchased it otherwise.",0
The unit had corrosion on it.,0
"I don't understand what is the difference between the this product and washing your face with a washcloth. They claim the tiny vibration cleans your skin better but it is so slight and the brush is so soft, it doesn't do much.  I feel like people are buying this because of the cool commercial and it's more that it looks cool in your bathroom than it being an effective product.",0
Too rough for my sensitive skin...,0
Leaves your hair soft and smooth,1
"I don't review products often but this product was quite disappointing. I first ordered the Juice Beauty Exfoliating Cleanser. There were barely any exfoliant particles in it. And it didn't really wash off any of my makeup or normal daily grime so I further researched the product and contacted Juice directly. They explained that it isn't really intended to remove makeup, which seemed odd,and recommended I try the Cleansing Milk instead. Well, the Cleansing Milk isn't much better. It only smears my eye makeup around and doesn't completely remove my foundation. If I use a makeup removing wipe afterwards, there's quite a bit of foundation leftover.
I do not recommend these cleansers but do love the following from Juice: Nutrient Moisturizer, Smoothing Eye Concentrate, and Oil Free Moisturizer SPF 30.",0
PERFECT is correct.  My favorite concealer!,1
Love this.  Make skin soft and smell good.  I have ultra sensitive skin and this is just perfect for me. Great,1
I ONLY used it several times then it stopped spraying. There is water inside but the sprayer broke. Poor quality,0
"This spray smells GREAT!  My skin was noticeable more hydrated all day.  It also left my skin very glowy! (Good glowy, not oily looking)
But, by the end of the day, my hair was pretty oily and heavy on the top frI'm the mist hitting my hair. (I'll be sure to cover my head next time.)
Doesn't set makeup very well at all.",1
Bought two times & broke the first time using,0
I didn't like it. It left my hair feeling like straw afterwards.,0
"Not really what I expected.  My husband thought it smelled okay.  I was looking for more of a cotton candy,  sweet smell.  I'd  say it's more like a sandalwood.  It smelled like a bottle of perfume that has aged to me.  Just my opinion... Some may love it.",0
I have owned three of this model brush over the past 25 years - always an excellent brush.  I did not read the other reviews before I purchased - I should have.  It arrived and it is bright RED - not black as pictured.  It is also very light weight - not the same qualilty as the original - I agree with other reviewers - this is a cheap knock off not a Paul Mitchell product.,0
"Love the light weight and power. Hate that after only 16 months of once a week use, it is DEAD!!",0
"At first I liked color wow...it covered my grays. Then I put it in my cosmetic bag and it got over everything. My makeup containers were covered with  brown crap, that I had to take pains to clean. When I used it it just appeared everywhere--my hands, my sink, everywhere. Wash your face and it'll get on you towels. Yuck. Threw it out. Horrible product.",0
pretty much just vaseline (similar to night cream product),0
I'll never forget the first matte I fell in love with.. ,1
I really believed that this would not chip or wear off as quickly as other polishes.  Silly me.  It wore off even faster than most.  What a waste of money.  Would not buy any other colors or brand.,0
expired by 2 yrs,0
Trying to return this product.,0
"If you are a man who enjoys the great outdoors while at the same time feel perfectly comfortable suiting up for a business meeting and mingling with the rich and famous...or if you're idea of a good time is running a 50' waterfall in a kayak, racing your downhill mountain bike, climbing at the local crag...or topping said day off with that special someone over a super fancy romantic meal...or returning home to win the father of the year award by playing with your kids or in some cases your pooch in the backyard...THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT FOR YOU. I should have known that a soap fragrance with a fruit in the name would not be my idea of a ""Men's"" product. Further why purchase a product like this if it is not going to leave a smell on your skin...I would have been better off buying a stick of Dial. Now on to the next body wash that will at least let folks noses know that I'm THE man.",0
"The description doesn't say it is a refill, and the pictures are of a full compact. Even the list price of $52 is what a full compact costs. When I received it, only a refill was in the box, so I returned it to Amazon. Unable to locate a full compact on Amazon, I purchased one from Jane Iredale's website directly, and paid list price. I really like the pressed powder as it is quick to apply and the color looks natural.",1
Looks very natural.,1
"Beautiful fall color. Application of one coat is sufficient because color is so rich.  ,absolutely no streaks. ",1
Bought this Jan 2016.  Broke June 2018.  It does have a 5 year warranty so I will try to send it back to the manufacturer but it's disappointing - for $100 I expect it to last more than 18 mos.,0
"Love this Coola product. I have skin that breaks out no matter what sunscreen I use. This is the first sunscreen I have ever used that does not make me break out. It goes on like a moisturizer which is a nice break from the paste-like application of most sunscreens. The only improvement I would love to see on this product and the reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that i would like for it to be waterproof. Though I wear it all the time under my make-up or without make-up during the summer, I definitely have to have a traditional sunscreen for water activities if I won't have a sun hat on the majority of the time. I ordered my Coola through Be Pretty. My first shipment arrived without my product as it had obviously been stolen. I received the empty packaging with a slit at the top of the package. Be Pretty helped me to quickly resolve the problem and I received a new shipment within days. I will definitely order my next bottle of Coola from Be Pretty.",1
"This cream is absolutely terrible.  I tried the trial 14 days and my skin developed red dry spots, made my under eye area worse color and puffiness.
I have always had good skin, however I am aging so I was interested in this cream as it had such great results on the website.  I did not have ""great results"" actually as I stated.  I stopped using the cream and my face started getting better instantly.  I went back on my regular cream "" Neostrata"" and my skin is back to normal.

Also ensure you read all the papers with your 14 day trail, I didn't cancel on time so they send you another full priced shipment ( approximately ($85) without notifying you, you have a $30 return policy from when THEY send it not when it is billed to your account, thus not leaving much time to return as their policy is 30 day.  I was ONE day passed and they would not do anything for me.  I felt a bit scammed.",0
It doesn't do anything. I went to the store and tried this and it appears to work. Then I decided to order from here cause of the price. I'm not sure if this is the real thing or not.,0
"The contents of the 1-oz squirt bottle seems like good quality skin cr&egrave;me. But after only a few squirts, it hurts......... my pocketbook that is. The 1st time I purchased this same 1-oz bottle which was on a cruise ship, it lasted me quite a while.  The 2nd purchase of the same 1-oz bottle through Amazon lasted a very short time. There was no apparent leak from the bottle when it arrived. Definitely not worth the extremely high price.  I would recommend Elemis Pro-Collagen Quartz Lift Serum 1.0 Ounce to all my friends on Forbes 100 richest people.....of which I have none.",0
I bought it because I heard it makes good setting spray but some one lied. I've tried using it under my makeup I tried using it on top of my makeup but I don't like the way it makes it look.,0
The smell of this shower gel is a little odd - it almost smells chemical in nature.  I think it does a fair job of cleaning but have to admit that I used it to wash my hands once and noticed that it did not get the dirt off my hands - so not sure how well it actually did on my body.,0
"After using Jack Black for years and loving it, I decided I needed to try to find something natural.  Jack Black contains petroleum, oxybenzone, and BHT.  Like another reviewer posted here, the product I received was less than half full.  It was mostly air.  However, the real issue for me is the fact my lips feel more dry after using it.  It goes on okay, but after five minutes, it feels like I need to reapply.",0
I wish they'd bring back the original Zero G in the white can - that one was truly lightweight.  This one weighs my hair down.,0
"This item arrived very quickly, was packed very nicely in packing peanuts. I bought it as a gift for my Honey; he has quite the glorious man mane. Anyway, the shampoo smells great and it leaves his beard super silky. I love it; this is the first product we've found that really softens his beard hair. The beard control stuff is great too. He has tried oils and balms, and he likes those, but this will be great for our week long camping trips where he needs something with little oil in it to control his beard. Plus I think it'll make styling it viking style in braids and beads.

This only got 4 out of 5 stars because the brush. It's not great. It's really not even good. I mean, I guess it does the job, but you can tell it's poorly made and mostly synthetic. I'm not exactly sure what etiquette is when it comes to beards and brushing and what is good and what isn't, but even I can tell this is a cheaply made brush. I plan on buying him a brush to replace it, no big deal though. The shampoo and beard control more than make up for it!

Anyway, hes pretty pleased with everything, brush excluded and pretty much agrees with all of the above. Will definitely be reordering this when he runs out (Or just the shampoo and control stuff if I can find just those two in a set together.",1
Love this RUSK flat iron. My hairdresser uses this in her shop so I knew it would be a good one. Very happy!!!,1
"My hair dresser recommended this product. I've always trusted her opinion and decided to give it a try.  I just finished my first bottle of daily use. I don't see any difference in the amount of hair I see in the drain after I wash my hair.  I don't like the smell (slight medicine-like smell, reminded me of mouthwash).  And it is expensive!

I just finished the first bottle and it will be my last.",0
I have to say I am extremely disappointed . It is a really cheap product in its manufacturing . It is dffucult to use and the brushes in the dryer are really flimsy . I won't be recommending g or to anyone. So sorry but I can't find a positive comment.,0
"I ordered this two nights ago and received it in a day and a half Normal shipping. i have always wanted this Iron. I put it around 330-340 I have wavy, curlyish hair. It works perfect but it did have two tiny mini scratches but its fine .",1
Waste of money. Followed directions and it did nothing.,0
Great price! excellent results... Easy to apply. I had to purchased two kits one is not enough for long hair.,1
"My old straightener was discontinued and I saw all the good reviews and purchased this.  I live in New Orleans and the humidity is very high here.  My old straightener kept my bangs from curling up when it was humid but this product did ""nothing"" to protect my hair from the humidity and my bangs were all curled up all over the place - horrible!  If you live where it's humid I would strongly suggest ""not"" purchasing this product.  It was too late to return so I just threw it away.  It has zero working power.",0
"My girlfriend recommended this to me when mine started to crap out. It's definitely worth the price and I like the temp. control but it's not made for my thicker hair or even curly hair... It's good for wavy, finer hair.",1
Love this product,1
Great value. Works well.,1
"Everything positive that I read about this brush is true.  I have thin, fine hair.  I ordered the brush for sensitive scalps and really like using it.  I think the brush is worth the money!",1
"Did not work for my wife, be mindful of your skin.  Left burn marks on the skin, so had to return it.",0
"One of my favorite finds on Amazon. This is fantastic sensitive skin shave cream. Lasts for a long time, about 6 months if you shave 3-4 times a week like me.",1
"I like the old white jar version better. Pads are too dry now. I'm afraid they will all be dried out by the time I finish using. I don't get the ""tingle"" like the old version either. You're paying more for a fancier jar and dry pads. Will not buy again unless they go back to the old version. Very disappointed!",0
I buy this for upper lip and chin so I don't break out. It works well,1
Excellent and portable.,1
"I tried the Molton Brown Re-Charge Black Pepper stick before settling on this one. It smells like clean linen air fresheners and I'm ok with that. I'm not a particularly sweaty guy but I will have armpit sweat on my shirt if it's hot outside and I'm moving a lot. Honestly the Molton Brown performs better as an antiperspirant, but the smell of this one is a lot less controversial. This does not irritate my skin and it lasts longer and performs better than the drug store brands.",1
Love it,1
"My wife and I have been using Juicy Beauty Green Apple Nutrient Eye Cream for a few weeks, so my review is based on our shared experience. Here's the short and sweet:

* a little goes a long way! One squirt covers eyes, forehead and even laugh lines
* very neutral scent, so no strong odor keeping you awake at night
* not the most absorb-able cream out there, as it takes a few minutes to really penetrate the skin
* very smooth and rich. Feels really soothing to apply it
* didn't notice much reduction in fine lines, but skin feels very moist when I wake up

VERDICT
Given the vast amount of eye creams on the market, I can't say this is a ""must-have"" product, but if you've tried everything else and want something new, you'll definitely like Green Apple Nutrient Eye Cream.",1
Can't beat this brand of curling iron!,1
Awesome and gentle. Cleans the skin beautifully,1
"I have used this product for over a year.  Since I am super self conscious about my neck aging, while my facial lines are at a minimum for nearly 70, I had to try this product that I bought originally at Costco.  My best comment came from my husband, unsolicited, ""your neck really looks better"".  Enough said.",1
"It absolutely DOES work and last more than any other natural deodorant we have tried. Not a huge fab of its scent, but better than B.O. ;)",1
Did nothing at all for my hair.  All this did was occupy cabinet space.  I have found much better products on the market for far less money.,0
Did not like product didn't spread product evenly on skin.,0
"When the regular sensibio was unavailable, I decided to buy this thinking that it would be similar.  Nope.  It cleans face makeup off alright, but eye makeup or even cream blush wouldn't budge with this.  Now I could forgive that because this is different from sensibio and therefore the products would perform differently at the same task.  But the smell of this completely ruins this!  It smells like diaper rash cream mixed with mildew.  I can't imagine that smell being desirable on a baby.  I expected something clean and fresh (maybe a little powdery) but this is not a good baby smell.  I might have gotten a bad bottle, but I'm not going to repurchase to find out.",0
I've tried many acne cleansers and usually run into the problem of the cleanser being too drying or feeling like it does nothing at all.  La Roche-Posay is an effective cleanser that controls my acne better than anything else I've found and I have never had the problem of it being too drying.  It is gentle and effective and I highly recommend it.,1
I heard so many food things about this product but it's just didn't give me the results it promise I was disappointed,0
Doesn't rub off like a pencil! Looks more natural and application is very easy. I'm happy.,1
prefect,1
after 3 month and use 4 day in every week no result !,0
Ok but not amazing.,0
"I prefer it over my other conditioners because it's light,  not leaving a heavy residue feeling,  but still conditioning my hair nicely. I do plan on ordering it again.",1
"Did not curl my daughters or my hair at all. Different lengths, different thicknesses, didn't work on eather",0
"Just used this shampoo once so far as it just came in the mail. It smells good but does not have an overly strong smell even after using it.
I just cut 11 inches off and its now to my mid back. My hair is blonde and thin, this shampoo made it very light, soft and not frizzy. It was nice for a change. Feels like its healthy again since my long hair was not.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend. Hoping to give it 5 stars once I use to more and the results stay the same.",1
"This product definitely works, it was not as dramatic for me as some of the pictures but if you use it religiously your bound to see a little bit of length",1
I have only used this a couple times but so far I like it. It makes my hair silky smooth.,1
This stuff makes me greasy and I break out when I use it.,0
"Great stuff, it goes on easily!",1
this is an amazing dryer. my hairdresser has one and told me about it.  Although it has the same wattage as other cheap dryers the force is MUCH MUCH stronger. It makes the hair really controlled just with blowing it dry. Would highly recommend it;also after the two yr warranty you can send it back and they refurbish it and it is good for another 2 yrs.,1
"I've been using OPI Start to Finish for quite a few years.  It's not cheap, but it's the longest lasting two-purpose product I've found yet.  In the past year, OPI introduced a ""formaldehyde-free"" formula, and since I've always read how bad formaldehyde is for our nails, I tried it. At some point while using it, I started having problems with my nails peeling! It was horrible. It never occurred to me that the ""healthy"" product could be the cause, so when I ran I out, I bought a second bottle.  The peeling problem continued, and finally the light bulb went off.  I went back to this ""Regular"" formula, and guess what?  The nails are healing.",1
The best shampoo for really oily hair!,1
works well maybe for shorter hair people but if you have long hair i would suggest you get a longer one without rubber on top,0
"Wish I had known this product only works on dark hair prior to using it.

Also, DO NOT USE ON TATTOOS! It burns like a sonuvagun!!",0
"This the the best product for me, as my hair is dry.  I can't usually find at stores, so glad I was able to find it online.",1
"Refreshing, though I feel like you need to spray it on a clean face, otherwise it feels kind of sticky and gross. I used it after I went to the gym once and then felt like I needed to scrub my face off. However, on a clean face it's really nice and refreshing and my face feels dewy. I love that word and how it feels :) There is a pretty strong rosy scent when you first spray it on, but it fades pretty quickly. I would recommend and buy again.",1
"Loved the scent, very subtle compared to Sauvetico. Easy to apply. Unfortunately, the hold was far from what I would consider a medium hold- more like a soft hold in my thicker, medium-course hair. Did not hold for more than a few hours, and hair immediately lost form minutes after applying... and even using a generous amount. Will give Layrite one more try with the Super Hold formula.",0
"Love how well it works and how easy it is to use. However, the wire inside snapped after about a dozen or so uses. I am still able to use it but it's difficult to bend without poking my fingers, and the shape looks kind of lumpy rather than circular. I'm going to get another one and try to be more gentle this time. :)",1
"what a fantastic, nourishing spray! it's organic, it smells great, and gently moisturizes. I use this right after i shower and anytime i need a refreshing boost to my skin. this also works pretty good as a makeup setter - esp if you use matte face products and spritz this on after your makeup has set, your skin won't look thick or cakey, it will look like... skin. I have tried many face sprays and this is honestly one of the best. I am a big fan of several Mario Badescu products, with this one being right at the top of the list!",1
"great little thing, cleans the mess and it is refillable",1
"Got a lot of compliments.  Polish is naturally chip resistant.  Good brand of polish, OPI is my other fav, this is the first time I tried Essie.  Now I am open to Essie as well as OPI.  (tip----learned from my manicurist that the Essie sold in drug stores with white lettering on the bottle is NOT the real Essie- beware.)",1
It is broken.,0
"It was hot enough. I was able to lye down while drying hair. The price was reasonable. Excellent product, so far.",1
Most excellent!,1
"I have been using Connair round brush for years which is a fraction of the price I paid for the Calista hair styler and i regret not returning the Calista right away. Compared to the Connair, which you can buy at any CVS, the advantages the Calista has are that is not noisy and heats up faster, other than that I did not get the shinny hair the reviews talked about and I did not like that it only has one choice of brush diameter, about one inch, I did not find no other difference or advantage. To me, it was one of those buys prompted by the commercials, not worth the expense.",0
Always come back to this one,1
Package arrived undamaged and  on time.,1
This product is usually great however the one I just received doesnt work. Even when taking the top off hardly anything comes out. Very disappointing Id give no stars if I could,0
Works very well with the toothpaste.,1
"I had this product applied to my hair several years ago at a salon and loved it. I recently had it done again in a salon and I was very disappointed in the results. The product clearly stated it was ok for use on double processed hair [highlights and low lights] which I have now. The product was only on my hair about 5 min and we noticed that the hair was starting to break and scrunch up despite combing. Immediately washed it out and applied neutralizer to stop the damage. Applied Moroccan deep conditioning masque and left it on for about 20 min. I have had to do keratin treatments weekly and finally my hair is starting to look better. I have a lot of breakage around the crown and now little hairs sticking up until they grow out. Ugh! My stylist used Pravana on my hair several months before trying this more permanent treatment and I wish I would have stuck with that instead. It may not smell very good for the first week, but my hair looked great and sustained no damage. Stick with what you know. PS. The product my stylist used was purchased from a beauty supply, not Amazon. I would not suggest using this at home if at all!",0
This was pretty expensive in my opinion and I did not see accurate results from it. I tried with additional products but my hair always fell flat. Maybe I was not using it correctly but I followed the directions on the bottle so I would not recommend this product.,0
"It smells REALLY strong. Just a warning to those out there. If you have sensitive noses, I wouldn't recommend this product as it can be overpowering. Product works pretty well. It does wonders for small pimples, but you do need more time with the big ones. It can dry out your skin so I recommend moisturizing after using it. Remember not to mix it :) it works best seperate.",1
"I am growing out my hair and purchased this item as it is what my hairstylist uses at her salon. I am in love, it's absolutely worth the $30 I paid and my hair looks great. It glides through your hair and doesn't snag - you can flip or do full blown curls.

Please note that this iron runs hot so use it in the middle heat range first - I have thick hair and was burning my hair because I turned it all the way up - this is definitely a high end product and you will not regret it.",1
"The glycolic facial cleanser does what it says in leaving a squeaky clean face. Most notably, I noticed shaving after washing my face with this cleanser felt smoother, less irritating and the hairs were softer.

I've been using the cleanser for over a year and the two reasons for not giving it 5 stars are:
1. There does not seem to be an appreciable lather. While this does not affect it's effectiveness, it takes some getting used to if you're accustomed to rich lathering cleansers or heavy shave creams.
2. I've found the cleanser changes texture over the course of using a bottle unless you remember to gently shake before each use.

Overall, I highly recommend this cleanser. I continue to use it and I'm upset when I run out and haven't remembered to order a new bottle before the old one runs out.",1
Keeps my dry skin fairly moist and I love the lavender scent,1
"Cant do without my Clarisonic!  Amazon has a nice assortment of brush heads, good prices.  Convenient ordering so I always have a few on hand.",1
Dried my hair out so much it was stiff and nasty. Not sure what's up with this. I have had good experience with CHI products  just not this one.,0
"I've been struggling for a while with dandruff, scalp psoriasis what have you- this is the only thing that has consistently worked.  I don't like taking steroids and perscription creams so this has really been a godsend.  Thanks!",1
not a good quality product. way too high heat with no way to adjust. cause a lot of breakage when I used it.,0
Fabulous hair dryer!,1
"Hands down, the best straightener on the market for the price. I've had two CHI irons in the past, but when they both broke, I researched for days on the best straightener. Low and behold, I found this. I was skeptical at first because I was using a new product, but it makes my hair so smooth and frizz-free. The CHI would actually make my hair feel oily by the end of the day, but this doesn't. Plus, the titanium is so much safer and better on your hair. My hair stylist raved about it when I mentioned it to him and agreed that my hair looked less damaged on the ends. My mother borrowed mine for a few days and is now ditching her CHI for the BabyBliss Nano Titanium. She fell is love, as did I! The fact that you can change the temperatures is such a neat feature. I have some baby fine hair close to my face and my side-bangs are thin too, and I can turn the heat really low so those pieces of hair don't fry and then I can turn the heat up to get the rest of my hair silky smooth. Takes such little effort. Cuts my straightening time in half from when I used the CHI. Love this product!",1
my husband really likes it.,1
"It's gets a solid four stars from me. When I first bought this, I was thrilled. This was the first mascara in decades that didn't give me bloodshot, irritated eyes. But after three or four weeks, the same old problems came back. It got very clumpy, and my eyes got irritated by the end of the day. This is probably because there are no preservatives. So at $18.75 once a month (or less when it's on sale at Whole Foods), it's a much better deal than Chanel, Lancome, etc., which have cause me misery for years.",1
Our baby had severe baby acne for a few weeks and we read online to try this product. We ordered it and within a week everyone was saying how clear his skin was looking! I would highly recommend it for baby acne!,1
"I've been using this moisturizer at night along with PCA's BPO 5% Cleanser twice daily and the occasional rotation of cleansing with the Blemish Control Bar for a few months now.  I went from have continuously red/scarred skin (to the point that I would never go out in public without makeup) and pretty bad pre-period breakouts that would cause blemishes lasting for minimum of a couple weeks.  Well, my skin is significantly less red/scarred on a daily basis and my monthly breakouts have been reduced to a couple, small whiteheads (instead of large, red cystic acne).  I'm not quite to the point of going out without any makeup, but I think that day isn't far away.  I do still have blackheads, but I can gradually work on those now that I'm pimple free!
I had tried so many different products and home remedies--nothing worked until I started using these PCA products.  If you have extremely oily skin and you get bad hormonal breakouts, please try these products.",1
Very good for dry feet,1
This is my all time favorite body lotion. I love them pump!!! No messy fingers dipping into a jar. Lipikar gives you just enough moisture without feeling oily. Great everyday body lotion.,1
Unfortunately the product was not packaged very well for the postal system.  The entire bottle of shampoo leaked out before it was delivered to me.  I am going to try and find the product locally.,0
"I enjoy this product for the smell aspect, it has a very clean scent. Unfortunately, it has not cleared up my keratosis at all. I've been using it daily, the body wash along side the body lotion. Unimpressed for the price I paid. Perhaps my kp needs a different approach, possibly internally through diet. Sometimes a cream just won't clear up your issues, you have to dive deeper! I did however receive the product within two days which was very nice and unexpected.",0
"Love it.  Easy to use, cheaper than the other dry shampoo I was using, and a bottle lasts me about a month (with medium length hair).",1
"This is the best over the counter product for cystic acne, hands down. I used it frequently during pregnancy as it doesn't have any drugs in it that are contraindicated. I like this better than many of my RX acne products.",1
This item was not sealed.  It was open and did not seem to be full.,0
Doesnt clog pores. Great for oily skin.,1
"Very disappointing, the color was okay, but the dispenser was useless the product was either old or the dispenser was faulty as the gloss never flows well. would not recommend this product.",0
"This is one of the best moisturizers I've ever used! It's so rich and creamy and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft without any greasiness. I'm a 39 year old female with very sensitive skin. My skin type is normal with an oily T-Zone and I have some redness on my chin and around my nose. This moisturizer not only leaves my skin feeling amazing but it also tones down the redness I have. My 44 year old husband has very sensitive, combination skin with slight rosacea. He's been using this moisturizer for two weeks and he said that this is his new favorite. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I don't care for the scent which is very faint but it smells like old lipstick. My skin loves this moisturizer so the scent doesn't bother me enough to stop using this. I highly recommend this to both men and women who have sensitive skin that's prone to redness.",1
"Very good cream.  I use about an almond sized drop in a bowl, work up a lather and start shaving.  I'm still a little slow, so the lather tended to dry a little before I finished each pass.  That was easily solved by adding a little more lather to my face.",1
"Never. Again.

I have normal to oily skin and decided to give this a go. I used the recommended treatment and in two days time my face was so dried out that my skin was flaky and bleeding. I had to continuously put Vaseline on my face every night to make it go away. I definitely do NOT recommend unless you are desperate as heck because this just hurts. However once you get passed thget five days of looking like some sort of creature that not even makeup can disguise, you will have clear skin. Unless you have severe acne issues just STAY AWAY and use something else.",0
Sebastion drench shampoo sebastion drench conditoner and sebastion potion 9 is all I use. I grow my hair out to donate and these are the best products I've came across to get my hair happy (soft) and healthy (strong). I have dark brown/black loose quarter curls btw.,1
"This works wonders for me. I have very stubborn hormonal acne. I'm 24 and I've had it since I was 11 years old, even with the ""help"" of birth control. I put this stuff on at night, basically all over my face most of the time, and by morning my acne is considerably smaller and less red. If I don't use this consistently my acne flares terribly. I will never be without this stuff until by some miracle my face becomes acne free. Even then I'll probably keep it on hand just in case.",1
"I was not thrilled with this product.  It gunks up your razor.  When used on my legs, it gave me itchy skin (allergic maybe?).  When used under my arms, it kept my deodarant from sinking in as well.  When used on my bikini area, it gave me a yeast infection.  It did help reduce irritation the tiniest bit, but also kept me from getting a close shave.  Maybe this works for a man who is using it on his face, but I don't recomend it for other women.",0
"I honestly thought its be bigger, but i didn't read its size so it was my fault, but smells amazing. ive gotten many compliments when i go out.",1
"I have noticed no difference in my skin, and I have been using it everyday!",0
My under arms are very sensitive and this would not work for me. Burning and itching for three days after using it.,0
Love this shampoo!! It leaves my scalp tingling and hair feeling very clean. Highly recommend it despite the steep price (which is the only reason it's getting 4 stars.),1
This product really does add lift to a hairdo but it feels a little rough (dry) in my hair.,1
"I loved this travel dryer when I first used it.  However this morning, I plugged it in ready to go and there was no response.  I tried using several outlets in our house and got no action.  My last hair dryer lasted 8 years without failing.  This is very disappointing.",0
This has really helped my acne. I use it with the IS clinical cleanser,1
I do like this product alot I just wish it was not as red--thought it would be a bit pinker.,1
"This primer is the trick to a flawless finish when using Jane Iredale's BB Cream. When using the cream alone, I found it to clump around blemishes or patches of dry skin. This primer creates a smooth base for concealer, foundation etc to go on smoothly even if your face isn't perfectly smooth. It has a pleasant smell and doesn't irritate sensitive skin.",1
"I thought this would be a holy grail dry shampoo. I typically use Batiste, I have tried other dry shampoos but I always come back to Batiste. I have read reviews and seen people rave about this product on YouTube so I figured I would give it a shot despite the $20+ price tag. This was awful, it did nothing to combat my greasy hair and no matter what I did I could not get the white residue out of my hair. I would suggest buying Batiste for half the price. There is a wide variety of scents and you can even color match so that you don't look like you are going prematurely grey.",0
"My wife has never used a skin illuminator before, but has heard of it.  It is suppose to give you a glow where light would naturally hit your face.  Being a novice at this, my wife found it easy to use.  She has carfully placed it right on her cheekbones and some of the her brow bone.  The product indeed give a subtle glow.  My wife admits that it maybe better for someone who has been using this type of make up.  It was easy and convenient pen type application with a brush of just the right size.  The product applied smoothly, and little goes a long way.  She likes how easy it is to take with you in its slim container.",1
I have purchased this product on-line many times but it arrived broken to pieces.,0
Beautiful color,1
Not crazy about the color.,0
Do not get this product. It's not the real brush a knock off only get through half the blow dry and it snapped in half,0
"But it doesn't take all of my makeup off. I use it in conjunction with the Avene water but I still have to use a cotton pad to get the rest of the makeup off.. I wouldn't order this again. Although I do like the Avene products, I might try a different cleanser at a later date.",0
Smells good thought it was cleaning well but maybe making my hair feel a little dry now it's 4 days later and my head is REALLy REALLY itchy I have to stop using this now. Never had a problem with itchy scalp before.,0
"This is the second tube of the Balm Shelter Tinted Moisturizer that I have purchased.  The first was a light medium and then I decided to get the lighter color in order to combine the two.  I find it is a very easy product to use and almost weightless.  I have somewhat sensitive skin, and this product does not cause any problems.  I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a tinted moisturizer.",1
I did not purchase this here but I wanted to share about my experience with the poor customer service from Conair.  The concentrator nozzle on this broke so I called Conair.  They explained that they would send me a new one at no charge.  I was so happy and telling all my friends how great their service was.  3 weeks later I never received anything so i called them back and was told that they do not have any replacement parts and that i would need to purchase a whole new dryer.  I was upset by this and they passed me on to a supervisor who said that all she can offer is an apology for their poor customer service.  NOT good enough.  Had my original call with them been that they didn't have anything I would have been ok.  The fact that they offered it and then took it away with no compensation is what is really frustrating.,0
terrible stuff,0
This may be a good product but when I tried it the color was too dark.  When I read the other reviews it said to go a shade lighter and I did.  Disappointed that the light brown looked almost black.  May try to return and try a lighter color.,0
"I bought this nail polish remover because I was trying to find a more natural polish remover than your typical acetone you buy at the store. It has a wonderful scent compared to other removers and takes off your polish with ease. It has a nice pump top so all you need is a cotton ball and you're good to go. It is says its supposed to nourish your nails and keep your next coat of polish on for longer, I believe it does! My nails feel and look so healthy after I use this remover and my next coat (Zoya Nail Polish) also seems to last a little bit longer than usual. I will definitely buy this product again.",1
Love it!,1
"I should have listened to the mediocre reviews, but i wanted to try them out. I used them at normal temp as well as after being kept in the fridge.

Unfortunately, they really didn't do anything at all. :(

Im convinced that the glowing reviews are either sponsored people or people from the company who were given $ to purchase (so it shows as verified purchase)

My skin is quiet sensitive and reacts to even the faintest solutions. With this product there was zero change. Definitely not a good quick fix.",0
This pump does not hold up. The pump itself breaks down after the first couple of days. If there was another item available to use for the application of the xfusion powder I would definitely not purchase this again.,0
"I had read a bit about this candle product from Baxter of Cali before buying bec it is a pricey one. Candles over $50 (small size candles) should not only have great scents but also be able to fill a space pleasantly without being overwhelming. This scent White Wood No. 3 surely does not overwhelm. It completely underwhelms and almost gives off NO scent at all. Bottom line very disappointing for such an expensive candle.
I contacted the company explained my concern and they said they would take it back but I would have to pay for shipping it back..almost $10 for those of us NOT in the shipping business. Felt that was too expensive and with no sense (no pun intended) that a replacement would be any better, I just put it away for use when the lights go out.",0
"A very good shaving soap as you get a very 'rich' and smooth consistency lather, which in turn helps to create a close and comfortable shave. There is no need for a separate bowl for whipping up and lathering process. The whole package is nice and secure - the lid fits firmly, and hence no worries over possible leaks. I am very impressed with this Proraso product and have no hesitation in recommending it.",1
not as good as advertised,0
This may work for other's. But I did not like this product at all.,0
its ok,0
"we took a chance and bought a cologne online, it was a great idea, i've had eternity before, never the aqua, especially buying it online, the price was way better than buying it at the retailer, way better than waiting in line and it was exactly as described, thank you!!",1
very nice product.,1
"I ordered this and tried it for the first time on Christmas Eve, right before leaving the house to collect my mother, gather my kids and husband, and traipse over to my husband's parents house for the evening.  At first, I thought, hey, I can feel the oil on my fingers...maybe this is the hairspray I've been waiting for! Then about 10 minutes later, the scent hit me.  Now I dunno about the rest of you, but scent is a large part of how worthy I deem a product.  If the orange doesn't smell good, you don't eat it.  If the milk doesn't smell good, you don't drink it.  And if the beauty product doesn't smell good, you don't put it on.  This stuff though...this stuff was TRICKY. The horrible, acrid, unbelievably foul odor didn't really set in until it was too late for me to rewash my stupid crazy curly hair that takes HOURS to dry and start all over with something that didn't smell like a chemical refinery.  My only saving grace was that I was the only one close enough to smell my foul locks that night.  It was a long night. When I got home I tossed the rest.",0
"This is a counterfeit item!  After reading mostly good reviews for this curler, I thought I would give it a try.  Looks authentic, but it's not.  And it didn't work.  The timer function would only hold my hair for 4 seconds and beep once when done, no matter which setting I had it on.  Thus, it didn't even curl my hair.  -According to the YouTube video, it's supposed to beep throughout and beep rapidly to signal that it's done.  Didn't do that.  Red flag #1!  After discovering this, I dug a little deeper into the authentic BaByliss.  According to their website, their real products are only plum colored, and black for professional items.  Red flag #2!  They are aware of the counterfeit problem and have a helpful page about it.  Their website also states that they make all the Conair brand items.  So besides it being counterfeit, it didn't even work either.  Getting my money back and will try the conair one that I can just get at target.  Hope this helps others from making the same mistake I did!",0
"It got to me, melted guess being in the UPS truck it was too hot,  it broke off, so not much i could do,  no more buying lipstick of the net for me.",0
Very gentle and light for my sensitive skin.,1
Great shampoo for men challenged with thinning gray hair.  I bought a huge bottle and will buy another when this one's finished.,1
Garbage hold. Shouldn't be listed as a palmade at all.,0
Good price and fast shipping,1
brand new box and great price!,1
"I got a super sized sample from sephora with my rewards points of this Juice Beauty Stem Cellular CC Cream. (Enough that I have been using it as my foundation every day for the past 2 weeks.) I do think there are a few pros to this product, but I just didn't like it. And here is why:

Yes, it does give decent coverage for a CC cream. That is the best part about the product, but I can find another product that has good coverage and not as many negatives as this one did for me. I also liked the refreshing and light smell of the product.

Cons: I couldn't stand how thick and heavy this felt on my face. It was goopy and sticky for probably 25 minutes after I put it on. And then after that initial sticky feeling left my face, it still felt really heavy. I can't stand sticky and heavy feeling foundations and this was only a CC cream so it didn't even have as much coverage as a foundation. No thank you. I have been using the Lumene Age freeze CC cream and I have been loving that, so I would recommend giving that a try. It's cheaper too.",0
It had a bad odor and was rough in my hair.,0
"I've had mine for 14 months and it doesn't even get hot anymore.  It actually hasn't for quite some time, but after the return date...don't you love how that works out lol.  That is why it is getting 2 stars from me.  My hair curls perfectly and holds (with heat!) without issues and i feel like a slob not being able to curl my hair the way i want.  I absolutely adored the Power IQ, but Sally's said they're discontinued.  So, I chose this as a replacement.  Good thing I still have a 1 inch Power IQ in my drawer.  Ps babe, thanks for the gift...i know you meant well...love you!! ;)",0
Love it.,1
"Makes my hair feel rough and coarse. I have an almost full bottle that I will never use.  I am just using it until my other heat protectant comes in the mail.  I don't know how well this spray does at protecting hair from heat, but it makes my hair feel dry and rough.  My hair is much softer when it dries without this product in it.  It even makes my hair more difficult to comb through once the spray dries in my hair.  I don't like it at all!",0
This iron did not get hot at all! Accidently dropped it in my trash can and did not even melt the liner! At best it gets about 250 degrees,0
This is basically just Vaseline,0
"I've used this product in hopes it would work as a great overnight treatment but I was wrong. I want to save you all from wasting your money. It wasn't good at all. If you have horrible breakouts and decide to dab this on your pimple, it won't fade away the next day. Instead, you'll be washing off the product with your pimple still left behind. Usually Mario Badescu products work well so I trusted the brand. After using it night from night for spot treatments as directed, it wasn't worth it. I wouldn't waste money on it again.",0
"Im doubt that it is original. I demand to refund, no smell, pure water",0
"Smells great and the bottle is quite sharp looking. It's a slightly spicy and fairly masculine fragrance. I prefer the way it smells on my husband versus straight from the bottle. Like many colognes, the fragrance of this smells much better on clothing or on someone, compared to just taking a whiff of it from the bottle. The longer it's out of the bottle, the better it smells. And it's a long lasting fragrance. I can still smell it faintly on clothing days later when I'm doing laundry. Wonderful cologne!",1
I don't see what all the rave reviews are about. My hair still came out frizzy and i still have to flat iron every day. This hair dryer is no magic bullet. The only plus is that it is relatively light weight,0
why the item it different from the pic show online?,0
"exercise caution if you have sensitive skin - this product feels like it burnt my skin (rashes, swelling).  I haven't had a reaction like this before - based on another review, the ""culprit"" is probably the octinoxate.  My sister uses this product with no problems whatsoever.",0
"My hair dresser recommended that I try this after telling her that I blow dry my hair often.  She used some on my hair to show me what it can do.  I was beyond impressed!  Somehow it cut down my drying time and it left my hair feeling so soft and smooth.  I tend to have fly aways and this manages to keep them down all day.  I love, love, love this stuff!  It even smells fantastic.",1
This is the same set that sells for a higher cost at supply stores and their a great bargain for the money. The product works really well.,1
I received it today. But The item is broken. Awful protection!,0
I've been using this product for a couple of months and the only good thing it has done is make my bumps on my arms smoother. It does nothing to help with the appearance of the KP on my legs and arms and it upsets me greatly. I was really looking forward to wearing shorts without being self-conscious but that is not going to happen any time soon. This kit was overall very disappointing. I only use a small amount so perhaps that's the reason but I doubt it. the lotion also stings sometimes... i don't know what to do anymore about the KP...,0
"This cleanser provides a deep cleanse without the drying effect. My skin has cleared up significantly and the squirt bottle applicator is very easy to use. It's a little pricey for how quickly one can go through a bottle, but overall a solid product.",1
work great but you can't fix after your first applied.,0
"The item we received was ordered as a second unit for my wife.  When she received it, the unit was made very cheaply compared to her original unit.  The unit felt very light and made of cheap plastic compared to her other identical BabyBliss Pro Nano Titanium flat iron, and the flat iron would not close all the way (there was a gap in the plates).  After reading other consumer reviews online, we believe that this unit was one of the copycat units floating around out there.  It definitely was not an original BabyBliss Pro flat iron, unless they drastically changed their flat iron quality in the last couple of months since my wife ordered her first flat iron.",0
I ordered this somewhat on impulse without realizing alcohol is among the first ingredients. :(,0
"Holds for a good half day! Not too greasy, has a firm hold.",1
"The Blagger color is slightly misleading. It appears the color in the picture when wet, however, when dry is it a litter darker. Slightly disappointed.",1
"Opi is the best quality polish I've used, and I especially love their Bubble Bath color.  If you're a fan of nude colors, this is it.",1
Where do I begin. I'm 17 and have suffered from severe dry scalp and dandruff since I was 13. My self esteem went down the drain and always wore hats until i decided to buy this product. This product alone has made about 75% of my dryness go away. More than any oil or shampoo treatments. I strongly recommend this product for anyone suffering from dandruff.,1
I liked the fact that it heated up very quickly however the handle has already broken off the black piece due to the curling iron being used every day. So I will be replacing it very soon. I wish they could come up with something that could withstand the heat at 400 degrees.,0
"I am so particular about my mascara wands. I know that the super large, full bristle mascara brushes are in vogue, but I can't use them. They just leave my eye lids messy and my lashes lackluster.
While I'm not into the injection molded wands either, (I've found many to be too 'sharp' and 'pokey'), I decided to give mad lash a try since it was the only gently curved one.
Oh my. The brush is not sharp, doesn't poke, and deposits perfectly rich black pigment over each and every lash. The curve is gentle, and the brush head itself seems to flex with my lid. Amazing.
The formula is not dry, yet not too 'wet' either. It applies easily, and dries very quicky. My lashes don't feel brittle, and it does not flake or run. I'm able to apply a touch up coat mid day or evening without clumping.
Totally worth the price. I love it!",1
I use Neocutis serum and love it but this Broad-Spectrum doesn't go on smooth.  I like EltaMD UV Daily better.,0
"THIS SMELLS LIKE A BATHROOM SPRAY, I WILL BE SENDING IT BACK, I AM SO UPSET, THIS SHOULD NOT BE SOLD AS A PERFUME. TAKE IT OFF THE MARKET OR MARKET IT AS A BATHROOM SPRAY FOR A POOP SESSION.",0
"While I love the scent of this lotion, the lotion I received had a broken pump because it was not packaged well.  I am now stuck with trying to either somehow get the pump to work or transfer the lotion to another bottle",0
"This is a wonderful body lotion that has surpassed my usual firming lotion, it feels much more silky and sinks in better/quicker. I love the feminine scent and enjoy putting it on. It is more expensive than my old lotion, but the performance justifies the higher price. The product packaging leaves a lot to be desired, no outer box for protection so it showed up broken, but it still barely works so fingers crossed the pump continues to work the whole time.",1
"Other than teasing my hair, this is the only thing that gives the illusion that i'm not balding.",1
"Not greasy, goes on well, and excellent protection.",1
Do not buy this I used it for two months and it started making a weird noise and it smells like it going to catch on fire!,0
good,1
My skin looks better and the smell isn't as bad as other people have reported. Doesn't bother me at all.,1
"wife has a lot of fine texture wavy hair. I mean A LOT. Gets hot, stays hot, she loves it.",1
"I bought this product during my second year of law school when the stress caused my hair to start falling out.  The first treatment improved the overall texture of my hair.  By the fourth treatment, I noticed hair regrowth.  After all 12 treatments the regrowth was strong and healthy.  Two years later, my hair is still in great condition with minimal breakage at the ends.",1
I like the color of the lipstick. It's good quality.,1
It's a must!! smells really good. I used it regularly throughout my pregnancy. The creams last long if you don't put a huge amount of cream on the areas!,1
Good,1
Love it,1
"I was skeptical about spending $22 on a stick of deodorant, but this product is well worth the price! Only 3 glides on each under arm and it keeps me smelling great all day. Not too strong, but smells fantastic when you get a whiff of it.",1
Broke me out after using a few pads.  I probably will not purchase this product again.,0
"Made me break out. I miss the AQUA Primer by Lorac. It was the best, never broke out and my makeup went on smoothly. Last all day for me especially during the summer. So sad to see it discontinued. This primer and the other skin sensitive one have BOTH made me breakout and feel oily by mid day.",0
Clippers barely make it through a single hair cut without being plugged in. Battery life is terrible. I leave these clippers plugged into the charger when not in use and they will not make it through a hair cut before the battery is dead.,0
"Smells so good, you'll want to snuggle!",1
I love it. It really grabs the hair.  I am going to buy another one.,1
"I've purchased Blue Copper 5 Firming Eye repair over the last couple of years. It is a great product. Unfortunately, this product is not ""NEW"" as advertised. The coloring, texture and smell is very off. As someone posted previously for this vendor ""appears to be a knockoff,"" I would certainly second that thought. Shame on ToysNGames Etc. for selling something old. Like I said ""the product is great, just not from this vendor.""",0
This was the worst flat iron I've ever owned - Does not work like my REAL Babyliss Pro - Does not even grab the hair and hold it -- think this is counterfeit - Don't waste your money - I returned it and Amazon refunded my money - Get rid of this vendor Amazon!,0
Overall good product. Is very solidified and must wet hair or fingers before use to make it malleable. Not what I was expecting but I'm starting to prefer it over the goopy ones. Smell is nice and not overwhelming.,1
"This works really well on my skin for clearing up the occasional stubborn blemish that decides to turn up. I usually rotate from Salicylic acid to benzyl peroxide, so I tend to keep both on hand. I don't like using anything that stands out on my face or just lingers, so this is nice, because it actually goes on clear and dries quickly. After a few minutes, it's like I have nothing on my face, but I know it's working, because I see the results. The only downside is that this a bit pricey. I have found comparable products that work just as well for a fraction of the price. Other than that, it is a really good salicylic acid for sporadic spot treating.",1
Ne vaut pas ce prix,0
"This product is fabulous.. No complaints, scent is very soothing and relaxing.. You get such a good night's sleep after using it. I would recommend this for sure! Five Stars excellent product",1
not Elizabeth Arden and the sponge fell apart the first day.  do not buy if you are looking for a true EA product.,0
Didn't work for me.,0
This product has an AWFUL smell.  It contains patchouli oil - which is a deal breaker for me! Yuck,0
"I received this curling iron October 29th and I was using it the other day on a client in salon and all of a sudden it made a ""pop""ing noise and it sparked and electrocuted me. It is now too late to return and I'm out $50 and my only large barreled curling iron. Not happy at all! >:(",0
"I get my brush today. It's comfortable, my scalp likes it, but it has very bad quality. I notice my brush misses one teeth, i can even hear the air leaking sound while combing! I get my brush for like 10 mins only!! I am going to exchange it, hopefully the next one is having full teeth...
Make sure you check other sources before you purchase here... Be ready to get a defective comb if you are not lucky enough, like me.",0
"The first time I bought this stuff it worked great on my hair. Then I repurchased it and it works just as amazingly as the first time I tried it. It adds shine, makes it dry faster, reduces tangles and reduces the amount of frizz.",1
As others have stated I LOVED this flat iron but it also stopped working after a little over a year. I only used it for special occasions (so maybe used a dozen times).,0
"I have used many Pevonia products over the years and this is the first time I have been displeased with a product. The smell of this exfoliating cleanser is horrible! It wouldn't be so bad if it washed away, but it lingers! I will not be purchasing this item again, even if it works well as a cleanser.",0
"Use it every other day. Put it on thick and let it sit. You may need to add a bit more as you push the cuticles back. But I really like the results - my cuticles look healthy again after too much nipping made then dry, peel, and hurt. Not much nipping needed at all after tegular use of this product.",1
"This cleanser is too drying for my skin. After one use my face is red and irritated from being to dry.  It feels like it is sunburned. I do not have oily skin, but more combination...to maybe a wee dry.  The description of the product on the page here on Amazon states is it good for all skin types.  However, when I received my bottle of cleanser I read that it was for oily skin types but good for combination too.  I wonder if I had oily skin it would not be so drying....I would like to have known that this cleanser is ""great"" for oily skin.  That would have tipped me off to knowing it would probably be too harsh for my particular skin type.  Not happy.",0
"This is the best soap at cleaning off my makeup and prevent breakouts in my chin and lower face areas. Since ive been using this soap along with the decongestant cleanser, I have had no breakouts. Love it!",1
always purchase this shampoo and often have a difficult time finding it in the store so i ordered it thru amazon. went to use it this morning and it was as though i had used the entire bottle and tried to salvage some shampoo and added water to it to use the last drop.  really unlike the rusk shampoo i am used to. will never order it again. what went wrong?,0
I am dissappointed. I did not receive any papers or warranty on this iron? All I got was the iron in a box. I need directions. Warranty. Receipt.  Tonya,0
Love it,1
Has anyone found a replacement for this product?  The tube form was all I used to use and while I bought my years supply of this already I have to apply it 5x as often and still have dry chapped lips plus this product comes out of the tube gritty not lovely until it literally melts.  I would love to find a new tea tree oil lip balm that is good if anyone has any suggestions!,0
the patches are kinda dry.,0
Great!!!!,1
Very disappointed with this product. This plus CND vinyl Polish did not last 3 days.,0
caused my skin to break out therefor I use it on my neck and decollete only,0
"Great product and did wonders on my skin. It is a small bottle, but lasts a good amount of time. I can get about 8 weeks out of a bottle. The longer you use the product, the less amount of cream is needed to cover your face.",1
"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1
"These were obviously OLD tan towels as when I open each packet the towel, which should be white, is already tan looking.  Also in applying the tan towel, which usually works fantastic on my skin, barely gave me any color.",0
It's ok!  I don't love it. Not completely shimmery liked I had hoped.  Hoping it'd pop my green eyes..  It's pretty.,1
having been using it for years...,1
This is the only cream that works on my feet--makes them smooth and feel good.,1
"I miss chocolate fragrance. I can't believe they discontinued it. Didn't like pink sugar. too strong.
Will not buy again.",0
"Love them, they heat up quickly and hold my curls all day...",1
"Not good for fine hair, leaves hair greasy.",0
"I didn't check before my purchase but the sunscreen filters used are Octinoxate and Avobenzone, and Octinoxate degrades the already-unstable Avobenzone and none of the other ingredients suggesting that they're present to stablise Avobenzone. I purchased this for sun protection but there is little guarantee that it would do its job. Otherwise I enjoy the mint flavour, it's moisturising and not much lip balm is dispensed by the packaging (so it'll probably last a long time). I will use it up but won't repurchase.",0
"REVIEW OF: OBAGI PROFESSIONAL-C SUNCARE BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30

SUNSCREEN, 1.7 OZ

Obagi has a reputation for many fine skin products. This sunscreen is very light and provides a nice 'finishing' look to your overall facial appearance

The pump-up feature allows you to deliver the right intended small amount which reduces waste and over-application.  Only a small amount gives a protection aganst both UVA & UVB.

The sunscreen is light, non-greasy and feels great.

Toxicity?  Well, Obagi 's products generally have a good name and a very low toxicity rating by the Environmental Working Group; rating of a similar product is a 4  -that is pretty good. Sure, there are many less expensive sunscreens- but be careful-they might
have greater toxicity. Check out that great site.

So far. this has  been well-tolerated. Worn over moisturized skin, there have been no break-outs, rashness, redness or other problems.

I hope my review is helpful for you! Thanks for your time.

did not do anything for my eyes....,0
I used this product with other Mario Badescu products (cleaning gel and and cucumber lotion). Did nothing to help my acne and did not notice any change to my skin.,0
"Purchased for my wife -- she loves it and asked for it in more colors...so, I'd recommend it.",1
My husband really likes it!,1
"Im a Layrite Superhold user, but thought I would give this newly popular pomade a try. As others have stated, the smell is quite overwhelming, like hairspray or cheap cologne scent. And it continues to permeate throughout the day--I couldn't stand it. The hold is good though (not quite as strong as Layrite Superhold, but with a slightly better shine), and remains pliable with a medium shine typical of a water-based pomade. Though it brings nothing new to the table, its very comparable overall to Layrite Superhold, but Layrites vanilla almond scent smells so much better (and not nearly as pervasive). Reuzel Blue is a decent pomade, but the smell is definitely a deal-breaker for me. I won't be switching.",0
"I have fine, long curly hair that has a mind of it's own. I looked long and hard to find a shampoo and conditioner that would clean without stripping my hair, and moisturize without leaving junk behind to weigh down my curls. Loma fills the need, perfectly! In fact, I can use the moisturizer as a leave-in moisturizer, and not worry about my hair getting weighed down or greasy looking at the end of the day. There is a subtle smell, which I enjoy, and there are no harsh sulfurs or chemicals in either shampoo or conditioner. I use Loma Nourishing Oil Treatment with the conditioner, which helps combat frizz and maintain healthy moisture levels.",1
It  just won't work. Tried opening lid it got broken on thw2 other end. Hard to squeeze. Waste of money.,0
"I love this product but it was lighter than expected.
I had purchased the same color previously so I am not sure what happened.

My suggestion for using this product is to use and eyebrow brush to shape your brows first and then apply the product.  Let it dry then take a clean brush and set the shape.  You may also consider a clear gel to set the shape.

I have a powder I use to fill in areas that need it.  The powder darkens my brows to make up for the lighter color.",1
"I was told this would soak into my skin and work really well under makeup.  After putting on my makeup I happened to rub my chin...my makeup was balling up on my face. I had to wash it off and redo my makeup.  I will keep it and use at the beach, but I won't be using it as daily protection.",0
"This odorless product seems to help with those fine lines around the eye, but not so much the deeper, dark circles underneath the eye. Perhaps it just takes a much longer time to see results there. It's easy to apply and the consistency is neither too runny or too thick.",1
"These self-tan erasers are nicely shaped for getting in between toes and fingers but can irritate the skin. I tested in on my skin and did not like the itchy feeling. I had got them for erasing makeup mistakes but it seems like this is not the right product if it's so irritating to the skin.

I had purchased a big bag of mini magic erasers from a specialty Japanese store in a mall that sells everything for under $3 and found these look suspiciously like those erasers. This product could potentially work, but I will probably not test it out as I don't want to risk the same itchy feeling on my face or neck. Magic Erasers are made of melamine foam - the same melamine that is also used to make those unbreakable dishes, so it's an abrasive, almost like a super-superfine sandpaper. Some other erasers can have a higher content of polyurethane foam that is less abrasive and softer.

After the reaction on my arm I took a look at various websites including Sephora. I found that almost 80% users reported red burns on skin that took over a week to heal and are advising people to use it as a last resort emergency product as it burns if you rub skin with it. I am surprised people are even recommending it as a last resort as it seems that this sponge is made of the melamine foam that has a harsh abrasive reaction as it literally scrapes off the entire top layer of the skin to leave a raw burn. The product packaging has absolutely no information on the composition or any warnings.

"While it does help fill in the gaps, it can leave your finger nails very dirty if you forget and touch you hair. Make sure to wash it out before going to bed. It leaves you hair and scalp very dirty.",0
"I love Lorac because it doesn't get streaky on me in the Southern heat. this stuff is $$$  but it works perfectly in my opinion. I'm always able to get out all of the tanner and I've bought it 4x (ULTA and Amazon) so far. It covers blemishes well; I'm self conscious about my scars (half the weight I used to be and also have surgery scars) and when I'm not able to tan as much, I grab this when I wear my short shorts so that my legs match my arms/face. a little goes a long way in my experience; it lasts about 6-8 full leg applications along with sometimes using on my abs for definition.",1
The pro is that it doesn't irritate my eyes at all.  The con is it doesn't nothing to enhance lashes.  I won't buy it again.,0
I bought the wrong thing :(,0
"It didn't smell right and trying to put it on was hard to get it to come out. Would not buy this one again,",0
Is too shiny and a light application did nothing. Won't buy again.,0
"The information given on how to find your shade family, undertone and shade are pretty interesting and really help to narrow it down to help you find the correct foundation for your skin tone. From there they give a great easy tutorial on how to use, buff with powder brush and for more coverage, use the sponge. Blend and build with a blender and then apply a setting spray. (I use urban decay and kat von d setting sprays for all day/night wear). I have rosacea aka red cheeks and when it is hot or I laugh more then usual it will cause my rosacea to become inflamed and be red all day long - I found that the dermablend really helped to keep my red cheeks at bay through out the day.

I did not need heavy coverage and the powder felt pretty weightless. There was no caking throughout the day either - which is a problem I tend to have. I did not have any breakouts or changed with my skin/oil production when using this powder and with minimal effort at the end of the day everything came off easily.",1
"Not that great, esp. for the price.  Makes hair sticky.  I am sad to say I feel like wasted my money.  Way over priced for the product.",0
"Great toothpaste for quick whitening, but seems to get to a certain point and where it doesn't whitten anymore.",1
"My stylist started using this product a couple of months ago.  I was nearly out of my former product, so I bought a can of this.  I didn't like it.  It does have a nice fragrance, but that's about it.  It comes out of the can nice and fluffy, but quickly deflates even before you even touch it.  It distributes through my hair easily (colored, permed curls, thick), but it's hard to gauge the correct amount to use.  At first it seems to work well, but on the second day my hair feels dry, it feels as though it has residue on it (so it feels somewhat dirty) and my ends start to frizz even without humidity.  I'm going back to Surface Curls Mousse and giving what's left in the Oribe can to my hairdresser.  Maybe she'll give me a discount on my next color and cut.  I might have given this a 3-star rating, but the Surface Curls Mousse is far superior.",0
an item I buy when needed,1
"The gel works well and the cooling effect numbs your skin so shaving is less irritating. However, the compressed can has gone bad on me and the Elemis company will not replace an almost full can, nor will they of course refund my money.
So beware! Maybe the non compressed tube would be your best option. I won't do business with the Elemis company so I don't know.",0
"I'm really glad I decided to try out this product, it's been a lot of help with my new tattoos. The salve thankfully does not clog pores like aquaphor does, which is recommended by most tattoo artists. Everything smells really good, smells really fresh. The soap is gentle on new tattoos and it's good for cleaning old ones. The lotion is good for sensitive skin that has just been tattooed.",1
"Doesn't ""roll"" off my face.",0
Smells good. Makes my hair soft. Doesn't seem to lighten at all.,0
"I love this product. I love the smell, the texture of the product, and how it make my hair feel, smell , and look. I will purchase again.",1
"I received this as a sample in my June Sample Society box. I am quite skeptical of self tanners, as they generally turn me orange or streak like crazy. This one if no different. While I did see color developing over an hour period and it didn't get off the rotten skin smell, it was very streaky! I hadn't even had it on for long and I had a dark streak on my left leg. I even made sure to rub and blend as much as possible. I had to wipe what I could off with a wash cloth and apply my normal self tanner, Banana Boat Summer Color (which works AMAZING). I could never see myself spending $44 on this! Especially when the best one I've used in the last 15 years is just under $7. Thanks but not thanks!",0
"I had KP and this didn't get rid of it but cutting out citrus for 4 months did! Completely gone and never returned even when I eat a lot of citrus now. As for the KP, I still like it for my dry hands and cuticles especially in the winter. Try the citrus cure ladies. It worked for a friend too.",1
Great product. Smell kinda funny.,1
Didn't work so much for me... tried it for five weeks and saw zero improvement. Decided to stop as it wasn't worth the money.,0
"This is a very expensive hair dryer which claims to be the most quiet on the market.  It is far from quiet and sounds exactly the same as my old dryer.  It is only quiet on the LOW setting which is no different from my current hair dryer and most dryers.  Don't waste your money if you're expecting ""quiet"".  SUPER DISAPPOINTED.",0
"Worked ok, but cant expect a facelift of course!",1
Very nice but it's doesn't last long enough.,1
"I love anything Mario Badescu. That being said, if you are looking for a facial scrub this is not going to exfoliate your skin. It smells heavenly and cleans your face, but it is more of a cream cleanser that is great for a gentle wash or sensitive skin. I am going to say this again because it really does smell that good, the almond and honey scent is absolutely amazing and I use it in conjunction with other facial scrubs because it smells that good. It is a bit over priced based on its utility, so I probably won't purchase this again for myself (if you are looking for a great facial scrub I would suggest NU skin products, BFF facial scrub or Clinic Exfoliator), but my friend is obsessed with almond scented things and has sensitive skin so I will buy it for her.",1
"This product works very well, is reasonably priced, and is the best match I've found for my (dyed) natural light blonde hair.  Every other blonde hair filler I've found is a distinctively golden blonde & clashes badly with my color.  My only wish is that this FHI Light Blonde Filler were actually LIGHT blonde.  It's more of a medium natural blonde color, but it still looks good (and convincing).",1
"Great sticky base.  I paint my natural nails weekly, sometimes 2x a week to change the color.  This bottle is a great value, I have not put a dent in this bottle.  Still preforming the same since I purchased it.  Has not gotten thick or goopy.  CNDC Stickey base has replaced my Formula X sticky base.",1
DID'NT SEE THE RESULTS AS SEEN ON THE MOVIE!PERHAPS IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T SELL ONE PRODUCT WITHOUT THE HOLDING PRODUCT TO FINISH IT!,0
"Very disappointed, scent does not last long at all. Must be old",0
I loved this so much. The color and the coverage were amazing. My lips looked awesome. After an hour or so of use my lip felt numb and before I knew it it was like I'd had a Novocaine shot in my lip. Half of my bottom lip was huge. It's bittersweet. I love it but can't use it. I don't want to risk having a swollen lip for four days again. This was the only time is ever had an allergic reaction to gloss or any make up for that matter much,0
"This works well and you don't have to use a lot of it. I don't care for the overly perfumey scent, though. It does go away once my hair is dry, so thats good.",1
"Like this product, except for its high price.",1
Not like other mosturizers it actually absorbs oil and really smooths skin. I have combination skin and this does not dry areas either. Really love this product.,1
"Coverage is terrible. It takes at least 4 coats, if not 5 for fully coverage, in addition to the base coat and top coat, ultimately demanding at least 2 hours of patience to dry. Because of how many coats it requires, it also chips quickly and easily. Putting it on is a nightmare that I wouldn't wish upon anybody.",0
"I love this product. The straightener heats up in a matter of 30 seconds. It straightens my hair fast, and all in all it's just a great product. Packaging was very nicely. No complaints. Best flat iron I have ever owned. :)",1
I just open this tube a couple of days ago. The gel is clumpy. The gel doesn't smell like the gel I've purchased before. It definitely doesn't provide a ffirm hold. Unfortunately it is just beyond thirty days since it was delivered.,0
Used it a few times by the 3 or 4th time it was reading wrong.,0
"I've used hot tools marcel irons for years. I have them in assorted sizes and love them. Bought one from this seller and in about two months it stopped working. When I plug it in the light comes in, but it never gets hot. And it seems I don't have an option on here to exchange it, seems a bit sketchy.",0
"not all shades are as pigmented as I would like, but they will make for good matte base shades that don't call too much attention. I'm really in love with the shimmery shades  I don't think I'll be using the lip colors, which is why I didn't bother to swatch them, but if I see a need in the future I will!",1
it has a weird sickly smell i did not like it,0
This is a great hairspray.  I have thin hair and this lives up to its name as W8less.  I previously reviewed Rusk Thickr Hair Spray and like this one much better.  It goes on slightly heavier than the Thickr Hair Spray but has much better holding power.  It can stand up to wind and humidity and keeps my thin hair from being flyaway (if you have thin hair you know what I mean).  The nozzle also does not clog like the Thickr Hair Spray can did right away.  It is also reasonably priced.  I have tried lots of hairsprays and this is my favorite.,1
"I ordered the dark as well which has a lot more pigment and seems to actually work. The medium is such a drastically different color with barely any pigment. When I shake the pen I can hear the liquid but can't get it to work after the first time. Very disappointing and have wasted my money. If your going to get one at all get the dark. Although it's too dark for me and for most everyone. you can still lightly draw in hair strokes then quickly blend it out before it dries to lighten it a bit. But all in all, won't be buying either ever again.",0
"I am 50 years old with occasional acnes. It is reallu hard to fight them, but I found only La Roche Posa Effclar products are working. I recomend for anyone who has occasional acne.",1
goood lip balm n gives natural lip colour...,1
The Fair color is very orange.,0
"Hands down, the best straightener on the market for the price. I've had two CHI irons in the past, but when they both broke, I researched for days on the best straightener. Low and behold, I found this. I was skeptical at first because I was using a new product, but it makes my hair so smooth and frizz-free. The CHI would actually make my hair feel oily by the end of the day, but this doesn't. Plus, the titanium is so much safer and better on your hair. My hair stylist raved about it when I mentioned it to him and agreed that my hair looked less damaged on the ends. My mother borrowed mine for a few days and is now ditching her CHI for the BabyBliss Nano Titanium. She fell is love, as did I! The fact that you can change the temperatures is such a neat feature. I have some baby fine hair close to my face and my side-bangs are thin too, and I can turn the heat really low so those pieces of hair don't fry and then I can turn the heat up to get the rest of my hair silky smooth. Takes such little effort. Cuts my straightening time in half from when I used the CHI. Love this product!",1
Notice some help but not as much a I anticipated.,1
Smells Good  Not Too Strong.,1
"Product came just as advertised. So far have only used one disc. Be careful when using these discs, as it is the strongest and can leave scratches. Overall happy with my results after using it my face was so smooth and products seem to soak into my skin better",1
"awesome product and fast delivery .
thanks",1
"ive been using guinot hydra for six years now, my skin has always been soft after the rinse. gentle & smells great.",1
"Wow. I have to say that this is the best blending blush I've ever worn. I was so bummed out when I saw how tiny the package was. I quickly found out a tiny amount goes a LONG way.
I was in a hurry the first time I was using it and couldn't find a brush(it doesn't come with one.) So I used the triangle cosmetic sponge I had been using to put on my makeup. I barely dipped it in and it blended perfectly. One dip did my entire face!  Amazing stuff. Found out it works best with a cosmetic sponge.",1
This mascara is terrible.  It dries hard and brittle and it is hard to get off.,0
Much more pale than pictured,0
"Don't waste your money. This is not a Heavy Duty Shower Liner!!! This a cheap light weight knock off that the Seller puts a sticker claiming to be a 10 gauge Heavy Duty. This liner weighs only 13.6 ounces, and if it was a real 10 gauge Heavy Duty Liner it would weigh around 2 pounds or 32 ounces. Buyer be warned!!!!",0
Plastique doesn't add volume to my hair.,0
Meh. One shadow I liked. Nothing matches and the packaging is cheesy.,0
Nice smell and looks natural.,1
"My wife got a sample, in an airline goodie bag. She liked because it moisturizer and healed her chapped lips. She especially likes it because it stays on and she does not eat it off. It is slightly tacky feeling but she considers that a small price to pay for the benefits. I think it has helped her lips and I notice the waxiness only during osculation.",1
"hi... this was recommended by my hairdresser. i like Punk hair - or fuller hair.
this product keeps it fuller, and not sticky like some other ones do.
i bought large size and pocket size.  excellent item.",1
"new formula not the same, Before this product would tighten my face like a facelift. Not sure what happened to this product.",0
"So when my hair hates a product it becomes like straw while I'm washing it. That's what this did. But I have now figured out that my hair loves shampoos that have a creamy texture, this is a clear liquid. Very disappointed since I love love love the oil.",0
bought as a 2015 Christmas gift for my daughter.  It stopped working 7 months later.  Amazon quickly replaced it with a new one!!!!!!!! Thank you!,0
I am not a fan of this product. Love the purple pureology but this seems to make my hair stick together. Much harder to comb thru after shower.  Not smooth at all. I will go back to the purple.,0
"The tip is really hard and it doesn't clean off like it says it will with a papertowel. I would think that a softer tip would work a lot better, but the designers of this product didn't think so I guess. I didn't put it to more than 2 uses, but those 2 uses told me that I wouldn't buy this product again.",0
"Did not work well for me, left a residue on my hair even after repeated rinsing.  Will not be buying again.",0
"We have been buying this soap for over 10 years, always very happy with it.  This recent batch came and the scent was incredibly strong, almost chemically in nature.  It was so bad that we had to remove the unopened bars from the house and threw the opened one away. I am calling customer service to talk about the batch, but from other comments, it looks like they have changed the formula and we will need to find a new soap for the future.",0
Great for skin moisture.,1
Great fragrance...so unique...and so pleasant to have my special gal wearing this!,1
"This tight curl version does exactly that. Using this on fine, wavy (color-treated) hair, mid-back length, creates tight accordion pleats.",1
"Even with my extensions, I can't hide it with my hair.",0
"Works like a charm, easy to use and heats up pretty fast.  Very nice tool for the price.",1
It's pretty random and small samples type stuff in it.  Not worth spending your $$.  Rather go buy one of the things at full price.,0
A++++++  product & service,1
"I normally use the .5 cream but got the 1.0 being my husband requires a stronger strength. He has had good results , I however can only use it once a week(compared to every other day with the .05) or my skin peels and gets incredibly dry and itchy.",1
Perfect for cleaning up mistakes.,1
"I bought one from Macys last year. This cologne is too strong and the citrus smell just makes breathing difficult. Two times I sprayed this cologne on my shirt, I had to wash them before wearing again. I stopped using this cologne after.(and gave it as a gift to one of my friends.. Shhh :) )
I only gave 2 stars because, some people might like a very strong citrus smell but I personally prefer something lighter like Aqua Di Gio.",0
Wife liked it!,1
Great curling iron. Perfect for my hair.,1
Just what I expected. I love this product!!,1
"lovely cleaning, a little goes a long way too. protects and moisurizes well. I have colored hair and it kept my color looking true. Made my hairs ver soft and frizz free",1
hope it will work well... we'll see,1
"Heavenly scent and a lotion light enough not to feel greasy, but dense enough to smooth dry skin.  I'm addicted.",1
Cleanses but does not get rid of acne whatsoever,0
"Would not buy again. I am a hairstylist. Dryer is lightweight and fairly quiet but not enough. But the worst part is the cord is all twisted up tightly. I have never had a cord at work or home do this before. I have to unwind before every client and it goes right back the same way.
I do not trust or understand all the positive reviews on this product at all!!  And when I purchased it was much less money. Now price has risen to $200? Definitely not worth $80. I've had mine 3 months and I am replacing. Should've replaced it after 3 weeks. Never been so disappointed.",0
"The first thing I do after washing my face is to apply a moisturizer because my skin is on the dry side. I haven't used a concealer in a while, but there have been times that I have wished that I had one on hand. I was quite pleased to have the opportunity to try the Scott-Vincent Borba Anti-Fatigue Invisible Corrective Concealer Anti-Wrinkle CC Cream.

My first impression on seeing the packaging was, wow! It looked like it contained a jar the size of my Bare Minerals Foundation. That seemed like a lot of product. I soon realized that I was mistaken as the jar takes up only about .75% of the box. The box is made with interior walls that hold the smaller jar in place. It disappoints me when I buy a package that seems to hold a good amount, and find that in fact, there is mostly air or excess packaging. I don't see the point of having the much larger package. The jar is attractive, but the lid is nearly as big as the jar itself, which I also think leads the purchaser to ""see"" a larger amount than is actually provided. This is intentional and very common, no matter what we are purchasing. A lot of time and effort is put forth to make us feel we are getting more than we actually get. The jar is pleasing to look at however, and the lid fits snugly. I keep my cosmetics in a small basket and I have no concern about the lid coming off when this is tossed in with the rest.

The product itself is good in my opinion. When I first touched it, it did feel a little clay like, and was not the soft creamy texture I expected. I used the handle tip of a small brush to take a small amount of the product out of the jar, and placed it on the back of my hand, because I prefer to apply and blend make up with my fingers. When applied, the Scott-Vincent Borba Anti-Fatigue Invisible Corrective Concealer Anti-Wrinkle CC Cream is much softer and lighter than I expected it to be. I use a dusting of foundation over it and it works great. Now, I don't have very dark circles under my eyes, but it is a little darker there than I would like. It also covered a small blemish that popped up recently. Bottom line is that I do like this product, and for me, it does a nice job. I am very pleased. My eye area does look brighter when I use this.",1
"I love this hairspray!  It's hard to find, and at a reasonable price! BUT.....after using a couple weeks, the nozzle got stuck on and would not stop spraying until the can was empty  :0(
I was foolish again to buy another can.....it did the same thing!
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!",0
Only thing we can use on my daughters very sensitive skin with her exczema,1
It was very expensive but didn't really cover my grey hair. You have to apply like five times on the same spot to barely get it covered. It is convenient but I wouldn't buy it at the same price again.,0
"Best flat iron I've had with African American hair.  Doesn't burn hair.  Leaves soft,  shiny,  and smooth.",1
Love it,1
I LOVE this hair dryer!  I have used Conair for years and it would take at least 20 minutes to dry my thick hair (and it never really dried fully).  This dryer COMPLETELY dries my hair within 10 minutes and leaves it so shiny and smooth!  The high heat setting is perfect - it doesn't feel like it's burning my scalp; it's quiet and light... worth every dollar!,1
"Fresh, clean, crisp scent. Always get comments on it.",1
"one of the biggest rip-off's around! $18.00 for this little tube, my index finger is larger...
i received it last night & i love (ART OF SHAVING) sandalwood products, but $18.00 bucks for such a small tube is not cool!",0
"It works great the first few days using it, and then the liquid runs out within a week. It also does not stay on all day like it says it does. It smears around the corners of the eyes. Terrible.",0
Ridiculous. It is just a sample for a lot of money. You can find other building fibers hair for less money. Be careful when you buy this one.,0
I like it.,1
Did not really curly my eyelashes well. Also felt like it was going to rip my eyelashes out.,0
I USE THIS PRODUCT REGULARLY. IT IS GREAT FOR ANYONE WITH SENSITIVE PITS THAT CAN'T USE ALCOHOL BASED PRODUCTS,1
"At first, this made my skin so red around the area that I put it on, but now I use it for a quick spot treatment and I have no redness, and zits are gone overnight!",1
"Does nothing, too heavy, didn't like it, not for my skin type, who knows, No, i don't recommend this cream. I rather leave it alone after the use of pixie laser pen.",0
"If only someone had told me 20+ years ago to stop tweezing my eyebrows so much or I would be searching for a product like this one day....
Fast forward to my almost nonexistent eyebrows and this recent fabulous find from Stila. I use this as a base to shape and color my brows. After application I set with powder, then apply a darker product: Maybelline Define-A-Brow in medium brown.
Before I was using the Maybelline product alone and could never get it to stay put all day. The 2 products together are a winning combination.
I know sleeping in makeup all night is a big no-no, but test it out and just leave the eyebrow product on. You will be surprised how good your eyebrows still look after wearing all day and sleeping all night.
*Note this Stila brow color does come out very light. It almost seems like the tube may be dry at first,  but I kept applying to the back of my hand to get the color flowing. Application is easy, not messy or wet and mistakes are easy to fix.",1
Ordered Wednesday morning you said it would be here Friday by 8 p.m. just like last year you've always changed your tune.... going to keep closer tabs on my records this year last year you screwed up many orders,0
"Did not like this at all, does not spray, is too thick . what I was looking for was Texture Maker.. Am I doing something wrong?",0
Very awkward to use.,0
"I've been using this mascara for 8 years now. I have tried all the biggest, best and most expensive brands out there... and they all pale in comparison to this one. The main reason being that Blinc Kiss Me is not a oily petroleum product like every single other mascara out there. Once it dries, it's there for good. It doesn't clump, flake, smudge or run, period. It also comes off so easily... just a little warm water, gentle pressure and it just peels off like latex. Cannot live without it.",1
"a sample of this eyeliner was in one of my ipsy bags and I ended up buying it - a little pricey for an eyeliner, because I am used to other  store bought brands, but I really like this one it dosent clump, it stays on fairly well, have to clean up the eye make up about 1 time a day, make up remover is a must with this product",1
"It is awesome, I really really like it, I used the prush for not ally this higlight but also for the blash , I recommend it ",1
I been using his shaving products for years. Was using Aveda before but it never lathered up and I did not fell clean afterwards. This product does lather up nicely and has a unique smell. Not a bad smell just different. If you are looking for face cleanser that does not dry out your face this is a great product. A little bit goes a long way,1
Fake! Fake! Fake!,0
Disappointing especially for price.,0
"I bought this based on the description, but on my blond hair the product looked kind of greasy even when dry. I used a very small amount and this is not returnable, so it was a complete waste of money. I wouldn't suggest buying any similar products on Amazon unless you have used it before or you enjoy wasting your money. It would be better for Amazon and Amazon customers if they sold samples of these types of items.",0
I love this shampoo. Makes my frizzy hair soft and manageable. Will buy again.,1
"It's lovely, subtle, natural looking and smells nice.  I use it for work but I think it is a little too subtle for going out in the evening.",1
"Despite buying an epilator (ouch!) to use before treatments and running the illuminage on the highest intensity setting, this product did not work for me.  I saw little to no hair reduction and am very disappointed in this purchase.  Not only did it not work, but it was a time consuming endeavor.  So I am out both money and a lot of time that could have been better spent.",0
"I ended up giving this powder to someone else. Something is off about this product, and it's appx. two shades darker - more like Honey Medium. I picked up Honey Fair from my spa, and the color is accurate. Also, the powder is very fine/not as grainy as what I got on Amazon. Buyer beware.",0
"I got a counterfeit product. The real Chi Silk formula is clear, the one I got was the color of Vegetable Oil. I wouldnt be surprised if it was half authentic/half vegetable oil. My forehead broke out in zits after using this. It usually never does with this stuff when I purchase from a store.",0
"This soap lathers well and the scent is not overpowering. I was hesitant to use this product, however, I find it a great addition to my morning routine.",1
"I bought this as a gift, and unfortunately it was not well packaged. The box is smushed. The label looks old, and the bottle looks like some of the perfume is missing. I am so disappointed. I thought this would be a special gift for my mother for Mother's Day. I hope the scent is authentic at least, :(",0
Great product! I am an Esthetician and I've used this for years. I love it. Works like a charm!,1
"When I do a French manicure I like to do the white tips first, then a coat or two of the nude color on top of the whole nail. I like for the tips to be less bright, and if I make a mistake with the tips I don't have to do the whole thing over again, but only correct the tip.

When I put this one on it came out very uneven, plus it made the tips look gross. Just the same as most cheap drug store brands I've tried.",1
"The package came with the product leaked out, I sent a picture and got nothing back.",0
"Loved the product when it worked; however, we received around May 16, 2015 and the product stopped working around July 4, 2015.  It didn't even last 2 months and now we are unable to return it.",0
"Not for my husband, but I loved it. I keep trying to find scents that he likes and this is not one of them. I tried it on the sons and they didn't care for it either as they found it too heavy and way too strong. Just remember a quick tap and spray is all that's needed so it will last quite some time. I think most normal men would like it, unfortunately those I tested it on are more outdoorsey guys and not into manly scents. However, I refuse to give up. There is something out there, somewhere.",1
Looks like chalk and bleeds past the lip line,0
"I like the product. I got it as a birthday present after hearing rave reviews from my sister. The only negative is that it has a stronger scent; therefore, I sneeze when I apply the product. Other than that, it's great.",1
Bought it for my husband. it works really good.,1
You can do the same thing with regular baby powder. Not worth it.,0
Not othenic compared to professionals buy at salons only,0
Brush arrived broken...had to spend 5 mins trying to reassemble the middle piece from the outer piece. I finally got it and used it twice and seems fine. Annoying though cause I bought clarisonic brand and paid the extra money. Had nothing to do with shipping..it obviously wasn't put together to start with,0
I am totally disappointed in these. They do not chrome my hair whatsoever I spend 15 minutes putting them in and an hour later no curl..,0
I loooove this brand but the only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is because the color pictures isn't the appropriate shade. It's actually a very beight pink!,1
I use this product every night to clean my face,1
I found this hard to use with the container.,0
This is not the same thing with the previous version they had. I am devastated that they discounted the previous version and replaced it with this one. It is not as thick and does not work as well. Please bring back the original version!!!,0
I know there are several reviews saying this is a fake or knock off...I don't know about that but there is a strange discoloration! I got a pale pink and within a day a gross brown color started around the nail tip. Fingers were not dirty and I was not using any chemicals...very disappointed.,0
This is my all time favorite hand cream. Wonderful light fragrance.,1
This has been a major pain in the ass I will never order from this again,0
Love this scent on my husband!,1
"Fine, good, works great. I like it. I wish the reviews didn't have a minimum word count, because that's all I've got.",1
Works well on folks w/greasy hair who can't take daily showers. Quite smelly although dissipates rapidlyy.,1
"Butter London simply has the best glitter colors out there. I have several of their glitters: Henley Regatta, Frilly Knickers, West End Wonderland, Chancer, Rosie Lee, Fiddlesticks, Gobsmacked, and most recently I added Fairy Cake. Some are more intense, some a little tamer... but you could not believe how brillaintly these sparkle. The colors are always fresh and fashionable and yet still elegant. The glitters can be a little hard to remove but with some regular polish remover and a little muscle they do come off. Overall I love Butter London polish!!",1
Left white residue in my dark hair.,0
Best value for these I've seen. My husband and I both use this soaps and like that it actually gives your hair texture without adding a film.,1
I love this product.  I received a sample of it once and I wanted it again.,1
Bought my first Ahava products in Israel. Love this skincare line!!,1
"Unfortunately the cord broke within the first two months and we were past the 30 days, so it does not allow me to ask the seller a question or try to get help with this product.  I've bought a lot of Shellac lamps for my spas and have had them all last 2+ years.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this seller.",0
It was recommended by my barber. Time will tell,1
Awesome product!!!,1
Great product,1
"Good quality, but overpriced.",1
"excellent product, good price,  I replaced one that my wife loved....",1
Received this product and it has a very strange smell to it.  I have used this product in the past and this bottle is not good....i would like to return this bottle as i have not used a drop of it.,0
Great tool; heats up safely.,1
"This product was old. Took it ti my hairdresser to look at. They stated it was old or possibly frozen. Not able to use, as is no good.",0
My husband swears by this. And it smells nice.,1
This texture spray works great for my limp hair. Not a fan of the smell though.,1
Just don't like it.,0
"I love the product, and I have had great experiences with Lorac.  I love their products!

The only problem I have is when I received the package, it looked like the palette took a tumble and one of the eye shadows is crumbled and damaged. You can imagine my reaction when I excitedly opened my new palette and saw every makeup lovers worst nightmare - a broken eye shadow.  I felt like my heart had been ripped out of my chest!

I contacted the warranty department, but I haven't heard back about anything.  If I can get this palette replaced, I will give 5 stars!! I love Lorac and I hope that there is something that can be done to resolve this!",1
"What happened? I have used this for over three years at the recommendation of my hair stylist. My last two cans did not distribute the product correctly. Like others have mentioned, the spray comes out in a stream leaving a thick blob of hairspray in one spot of my hair! I tried rinsing the nozzle and even replacing the nozzle with one from a used bottle that did spray correctly. It still sprays a weird stream. Sadly, I'm done with pureology. Happily, I discovered Kenra 25 volumizing finishing spray. I purchase it at Ulta or Ulta.com as I have received ""fake"" products from Amazon vendors. It sprays a very fine mist and holds well. Doesn't smell as subtle as pureology but at least it works and distributes evenly!",0
"I was pleasantly surprised. The balm does have a cool sensation, but the citrus smell is wonderful. Given the lower price than department store balms, I was expecting to have to use more of it for each application. Not the case. It is indeed less expensive per application. I will use other balms to get variety, but Billy Jealousy Shaved Ice will continue to be part of my rotation.",1
"Quality of shampoo itself seems good, but it does nothing that I can tell to eliminate the brassiness of my color-treated ""blonde"" hair. Gave it a try when my other product was discontinued. Will keep looking for another product that works better!",0
I used to use the other formula and thought I'd try this new version. It's terrible =/ I want to like it because I love that it washes off so easily with water. It definitely comes right off and doesn't stay on after any exposure to moisture or eye rubbing as advertised. It flakes on your face and other make up needing constant brushing off as you apply it. It makes little flakes in a couple of hours which leaves you looking... not so fresh. Doesn't add any length and needs many layers to be visible. This formula seems like a mistake.,0
"It sucks. It won't dry and it rubs off on my cups and straws, etc. Nothing at all like I expected....especially for $17 bucks!!!! Heck, I always get the $9  long last lipstick by Cover Girl and it is much better. Why gives with the good reviews???? Like the one girl said, the previous ones she had bought DRIED....but last ones didn't. Mine was like poster paint and NEVER dried.",0
I honestly don't know what kind or magical material this is but it removes everything in seconds. I love that I will never have to buy makeup wipes again because I feel like they are incredibly wasteful and most makeup remover irritates my skin.,1
This is literally my favorite mousse! Holds just the right amount while still leaving hair feeling touchable and flexible!,1
"I love the smell of this Tummy rub butter! I'm not convinced it will do anything, but it smells like flowers and is calming in the evening when my morning sickness seems to be the worst.",1
tends to dry out feet,0
"This is the first OPI product I tried and it looks nice on, but you have to put on several coats to make a glossy finish. My nails have high vertical ridges and I wanted to smooth them out. If too many coats of filler are on, the filler chips early on. OPI is supposed to last longer than other polishes, but not the case.",0
"This ""moisturizer"" sunscreen completely dried out my skin. Beware.",0
I bought this based on a lot of reviews from different websites as well It is a little pricey but it really does stay on the lips good theres no weird smell or taste of the colors of the little light for me very pretty and natural on a summer day !,1
"There are so many warnings and tips with Retinol that at first I hesitated thinking, I need a plain moisturizer. What magic beans are IN here?

Im glad I pushed through.

I was looking only for a good quality, non-greasy lotion for dry skin, so I cannot attest to its ability to remove wrinkles and make me look like a beautiful 70 year old again. () Ive used the lotion regularly for about a month or more and my skin itches much less than it did. I have not applied this to my face but my hands, arms, elbows, and shoulders are definately more... supple. Smooth.

But most of all they don't itch.

At the same time my 82 year old mother used it with me. She applied to her face as well as limbs. I wish I could say that she looks younger; that wrinkles have disappeared but I honestly don't see a difference. However she FEELS better. She seems to believe there are fewer lines and dry spots and isn't that whats important?

Make sure you know what Retinol is before you commit to this. By comparison shopping it looks like this is a decent price and where some would find this an extraordinary even ludicrous purchase others would say that if you're going to spend money then theres no better reason to spend it than to make yourself feel good.

The entire liquor industry is based on this premise. The difference? Retinol Complex .5 is GOOD for you. But let me say that calling this age defense plays on some of our vulnerabilities and feels a little like manipulative marketing.

Its still a good lotion.",1
Thick cream that works well but it is way too expensive.,1
"Applied to a lint-free cotton square, this remover works really well around the eyes to gently remove concealer and eye liner! I like that its safe for use around lash extensions. It has no fragrance and doesnt sting my eyes.",1
Awesome,1
Was way to dark.,0
"I bought this as a trial to replace my Dr. Hauschka blush that I had been buying for years.  I love this blush and will use it instead of the Dr. Hauschka blush from now on.  It doesn't create a powder dust all over the container when used, the way the Dr. Hauschka product does. It goes on evenly, lightly, smoothly, and cleanly and I like all of that.  Highly recommend.",1
"This shampoo is beyond gross.  After two weeks of daily use (as advertized on the bottle) my hair became so greasy it looked like I hadn't showered in days even directly after blow drying.

Simply do a search of others' reviews on this product.  You'll quickly find that many others have had similar issues with this shampoo.

I must say, though, that during the first week of use, my fine, wavy (and color treated) hair developed a thicker texture that held flat ironing and styling well.  But, by the second week it was so greasy I couldn't even get to styling--soooo gross it needed to be washed AGAIN and with something else!

I didn't think one's hair could look dirtier/greasier than before shampooing, but Paul Mitchell nailed it on this one.  Don't waste your money on this stuff.  You can get greasy hair for free!",0
"Made my face look dry, and. Not dewy also feel that it makes skin look no better, will not purchase this product again if you have dry or problem skin,don't buy this.mw",0
"This eyeliner smudges very easily and is not sweatproof in the least. After about an hour of walking around outdoors, I had very magnificent smudgy raccoon eyes.

I don't have great luck with eyeliners since I have oily skin and monolids, but this is the worst eyeliner I've tried in awhile in terms of staying put. If you have dry-normal skin and non-monolids, you might have better luck.

It is very easy to apply and does not irritate my eyes at all.",0
"I've used it twice. Love the air flow and heat options. Love the matte black finish. It is much heavier than my old (very expensive) blow dryer, and it VIBRATES in the handle when in use. Weird, but I'm keeping it. Hope the vibration doesn't drive me nuts.",1
Very harsh for your hair!,0
"Absorbs quickly w/o leaving a white coating or greasiness. Not heavily scented. Bottom line is that both my husband and I like using it. If I give it time to dry first, it will layer well under makeup.",1
"I was skeptical.  Now so happy.  My eyebrows were very thin and I was not happy with the way they looked.  Tried Latisse before from my doctor and it may have helped a bit but not much and you have to have prescription or get from doctor and it is more expensive than this.  I have been using this product since December and I have noticed a difference in the last two weeks.  A real difference. I don't even use everyday, I forget sometimes.  Eyebrows are much thicker and growing in around the edges.

I really did not need thicker lashes but I use it on my lashes a few times a week and I do notice a difference there as well.

I love this!",1
I still have deep lines!!,0
"I had previously purchased one of these brushes locally and lived it.  So I ordered this online.  It loses bristles when I apply my makeup.  Now that I've been using it a while the bristle loss is starting to slow down.  Not so many that you can tell by looking at the brush, but I have to stop and peel one from my face that's caught up in my makeup.  Otherwise I love it.",1
"Not a lot to say about a beard comb, until you have a bad one!  My last one was flimsy and had the sharpest tines,they felt like little daggers digging into my face each time I used it.  Which of course led to a decreased frequency of usage and an increased frequency of being called Sasquatch, Grizzly Adams (by my older friends), Mountain Man, ZZ Top...well you get the picture.

Enter the Baxter of California Beard Comb, it is quite thick and sturdy. This Swiss-made gem has the smoothes tines of any beard comb I have owned. The rounded ends actully feel good to the ole face, which doesn't get a lot of skin contact with the fuzziness. The tines are long enough to keep the beard nicely groomed.

If you are wondering...should I spend $14 on a beard comb, the answer is yes!",1
More of a liquid makes it look more greasy,0
I would give this a zero if I could.  Worst conditioner I have ever used.  It was chalky and runny like soup.  It did absoultely nothing for my hair except leave it dry and unmanageable.  What a waste of $60,0
"I've been using it consistently for weeks now...generally at night after I get out of the shower. Although the skin on my butt/thighs is definitely smoother the next day, I have seen no improvement in the appearance of cellulite. Would not waste my money again.",0
This product DID NOT WORK FOR ME!,0
Very disappointed - basically over priced watered down lotion. Not at all what I expected. Will be sending back if they allow it.,0
Love this product! Use not only on chicken skin neck but other creepy spots as well!,1
Shampoo smells great but it does not do as well as the shampoo in the salon.,0
"I thought this was my answer to my KP, but....it wasn't!

it does make my skin a little smoother, but it's not enough to go, ooooh!

Don't buy it, save your money.",0
"I love Avene the brand and i have been using this product since 2013. It is very refreshing cleaning gel that generate normal amount of foam, with natural fragrance. I first started using this because of its famous for treatment of sensitive skin.
I would have gave five start review if Amazon could improve the shipping&delivery quality. This is shipped with another yoga mat i bought at the same time and the bottle itself is definitely squeezed and some gel get out. I found leakage on the external packge.",1
"This will be given to someone who actually likes this hairsetter....I should have realized that because the rollers are not hollow I was going to have issues keeping them from falling out of the clips.  The size is nice, but they just didn't work for me.  I ended up going on eBay and buying a vintage steam hairsetter like the one I used to have in the 1980s.",0
"I guess it's a fake product. It is so watery! After opening it, 1/4 of the tube is just water, which is very different from the one I bought in the pharmacy. Don't buy it!",0
I cant get the head to spin I charged it up for 18 hous,0
This didn't work for me as far as controlling my oily hair. It also took about a month to arrive.,0
Way too strong to apply kindly in public. Please stick to medical grade Cerave etc. Concerned after Johnson & Johnson baby powder. I purchased their 100% shea tin & will follow up.,1
Great protection. I will order this product again.,1
"Like all Wen products this one is also excellent. Personally I feel that less of the product is needed to achieve the desired result. I actually use it more for a conditioner than cleaner. It leaves my hair extremely soft and tangle free, even when used after a regular shampoo.",1
"This stuff smells like the inside of a brand new shoe, yet twisted in a dirty cow butt kind of way!!!! Yuck!!! Holds pretty well though. Will never use again!!!!",0
"- Great smell. It actually smells like rose. However, if you are sensitive to smell, you may find it overpowering.
- Soft and thin texture. It's not thick, cream kind texture. If you like thick cream texture like body butter, you won't like it.
  When I was using it for the first time, I applied too much due to its texture.
  Since its texture is thin, I thought I have to apply a lot to make my skin moisturized but I was wrong.
  It immediately absorbed to skin and leave my skin soft w/o any greasiness and product so you can wear your clothes right after applying.
  Don't use it too much like I did. You will be stuck with the smell for a while.
- I had hard time to get the pump working. I thought the pump was broken but after trying it for a few time, I finally got the pump work.",1
"This was recommended by my hairdresser, so I thought I'd try it. It caused my scalp to seriously itch and burn. While I do have sensitive skin, I've never had this reaction to another shampoo before.

If you know you have sensitive skin, think about passing on this shampoo.",0
"Not a fan of this product.
Seems a little to greasy for me.
I still prefer redken or pureology.",0
"The fragrance is very nice, four roses essences mixed in honor of four French queens(view my review of the bigger bottle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rose-4-Reines-Eau-de-Toilette/dp/B002B4SSSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rose 4 Reines Eau de Toilette</a>. In general I like L'Occitane, as the fragrances are kind of retro and natural, made of distilled natural oils as in old days. And they don't evaporate so quickly like some ancient-formula fragrances.

It is s nice travel bottle, delicate fragrance even for traveling, not overpowering your nose or the noses of your neighbours, (even on the plane, I hope, if not too much of it is sprayed).But there is a problem with cap. I bought this bottle November 2010, so, maybe it improved already, I want to give the benefit of  doubt. The bottle is simple and retro, yet the tiny cap is so loosely fitting it falls off when the bottle is turned upside down. This makes me uncomfortable in a travel bottle, but is is a spray, and so far never had any accident, to L'Occitane credit, I am not taking the star off from evaluation. Maybe I am just being too picky after all. In travel bottles I prefer snap, click, screw or whatever secure caps are there for non-solid beauty/grooming products. Maybe it is just me. And solid fragrances differ from the liquid formulations. Anyway, the bottle's juice is worth the price.",1
"It's ok.  I have dermatitis, and have been trying several different things on the area.  This is one of the failed products.  I noticed absolutely no change at all.  It didn't reduce redness, nor flakiness for me.  Mine wasn't one of the ones that seem to be watered down either- the texture seems nice and creamy.  I don't understand the good reviews.  Did nothing for me.",0
Leaves my hair feeling tangled and dry.,0
Came with the box opened and seal off and it had obviously been opened and handled as the bottle was covered in hand prints and more than a little of the cologne was missing from the bottle. Disappointing since it was purchased to be part of my husbands valentines gift.,0
I bought this hair dryer a year ago and today it DIDN'T TURN ON. This is a lot of money to spend on a product that doesn't even last 12 months. Disappointing.,0
"Would not recommend. I used mud and clay masks all the time and don't have sensitive skin. When I took this one off, my forehead and nose area were BRIGHT RED like I had a serious case of rosacea. Still don't know how to get it to go away. Definitely not how I wanted to start my day.",0
Very professional,1
"Color was suppose to be tinted, but is very white looking when you put on your face.  Make sure you know that this is really body NOT face sunscreen.",0
Less effective on the dullness of my skin than the sensitive or normal brush heads.,1
"I use this fragrance for years and was expecting the spray which is for the cologne and not this.
It smells great but the top is not easy to use. But the price was a great ceal !",1
Used once and a month later it won't turn on. Waste of money and lives on my floor.,0
"I absolutely loved this curling iron for the first 2 months I had it. One day I went to use it, and noticed the tip was spinning around like it had melted away from the metal. I used it on my hair and immediately noticed a strong burnt hair scent.
The curling iron's heat settings had apparently gone crazy, and the iron burnt off a lot of my hair :(
I went back and read the 1 & 2 star reviews here on amazon, and noticed this has happened to several other people.",0
I like this shampoo but it can be hard to rinse out with repeated use.  It seems to leave a soap build-up in my hair when used for three or more consecutive days.,0
"this stuff is good for upkeep, i use it occasionally and it does the trick! I recommend it to smokers or coffee drinkers. besides crest whitening strips this toothpaste is the best.",1
I love this cleansing system. It is gentle and does not irritate my skin. The faster rotation of the bristles eliminates harshness and really gets my skin clean. I could tell the difference almost immediately and the comments I get from friends have been very positive about the way my skin looks now... it glows!!! I thought I would not like the charging system since it magnetically sits on the unit but it really hasn't been a problem. At times it can be inconvenient since you can't sit it upright but I have been able to find room for it to lay down to receive its charge without the charger falling off. I recommend this unit if you want a lower cost version that really does the job you want and is easy to handle!,1
"I do not care at all for this skin product.  The smell is nothing special.  I've almost always had dry or itchy skin, so I've been around the skin care market.  I think this made my skin itch more and little red bumps formed after application.  Either they caused the bumps or I had them before application and the product didn't relieve my discomfort.  Most Aveeno or Nivea lotions will sooth my skin if I'm having an itchy breakout of some sort.  I think this made it worse.  I would not recommend to anyone.",0
good product.  I have allergies to scented products these product work well for me.,1
"I simply love everything Burberry and this Weekend for Women Eau de Parfum (3.3 oz) doesn't disappoint one bit.  The bottle is beautiful, yet simple.  The fragrance is very pleasing to me and I've received so many compliments every time I wear it.  Fragrance has a very light floral scent and will smell differently on everyone but overall it isn't strong.  Be sure to go easy on the spray - a little goes a long way.  I personally feel like this is a perfume I will wear day and night, running errands or out on a date! I did stop by Nordstrom to sample the fragrance before I actually received it from AMAZON.com and the lady at the counter told me they didn't carry it because it was being discontinued.  I didn't verify that news so I'm not sure she's correct.  Would be a shame because I really like it.",1
I am a huge jane iredale fan & have used pretty much every product they make. This is the first product I have not loved. The mascara flakes very badly !! But if just one of their products is not up to snuff I'll forgive them ;),0
The perfect color,1
"Good lotion, with not much fragrance. I got the 1.5 oz bottle for a trial to see if I like it. I'd say the price is a bit expensive, but overall it's a good product.",1
quick delivery and product as described,1
Great for old school shaving..,1
"I bought this for my daughter, and she loved it.  The picture showed the glove, but my did not come with one :(",1
This was very thin and did not give any color to my nails. I actually think this product damaged my nails as they all started splitting a few days after.,0
not a strong smell of gardenia. won't order this scent again,0
"For years I've used L'Occitane products, ever since my sister brought me some from Paris. Normally I'd give their products a high rating, however, the shea butter in this tin was gritty under the top layer. It feels like rubbing sand on my skin and the 'grit' does not melt. It stays gritty. I will not purchase another tin and take a chance. This tin was a pricey waste of money.",0
No noticeable difference. If anything it seemed to weight my hair down.,0
I love how fast it heats up but the spring is already loose and might need to be changed.  I had my last one for years before that happened.,1
Great product to revive your face,1
"This is a good cleanser. I have combination skin, and I didn't find this to irritate my skin at all. I use it with my electronic cleansing brush and have noticed a difference with my hyperpigmintation left behind from acne I had a couple years back. So far, this is the ONLY product I have tried that has given me any results. They're not overnight results or anything, but after a month if use the spots were definitely lighter. When using this product I rarely ever break out, which speaks volumes for this product considering I have very acne-prone skin. The only negative thing I can say is that paired with the DDF hyperpigmintation lotion, it caused my skin to break out horribly and become red and dry. For people with sensitive skin, I recommended caution when using both the cleanser and the lotion together. Perhaps try only a little area of your skin at first to see how it reacts. Other than that, I love it!",1
Great color! Goes on smooth and lasts. Nice pink for summer and going in to fall.,1
"I saw other reviews on here that stated that the product is very long and didn't work for them.  I wasn't opposed to the extra length of this case since I wouldn't be using it for traveling.  However, there were not enough wide slots in this case, and even those that were there were a very tight fit.

I use Bare Minerals makeup, and use their brushes as well.  The brush I use for the foundation, which is truly not that over sized, made me feel like I was trying to fit a Kabuki brush into the slot.  I use a Foundation Brush, a Brush for the Mineral Veil (finishing powder), a brush for a bronzer, blush brush, eyeshadow brush, crease brush, and eyebrow brush.  The first three I've referenced are marginally wide, or at least felt this way since I couldn't fit all of my brushes based on width.  I ended up returning these and I will need to find an alternative.",0
Doesn't work AT ALL!,0
"It's so weird that I hate it, everyone else seems to love this shampoo.

My hair is really thin and not too curly, but i have some natural curls.

This shampoo leaves my hair feeling hard and somehow freezy, I'm now starting to use with conditioner to see if it makes it better but so far I haven't liked it at all.

Also it smells like a man's shampoo, which is such a turn off, it would be great for my husband but not great for me.",0
"Since I went with the Safety Razor and Badger brush over a year ago,  this is what I have been using. If there is something better let me know.",1
Lovely colour to wear either in its own or on top of another lipstick and long lasting too,1
Arrived nearly empty,0
Not even close to same color shown here. It was actually dark pink/purple,0
"Despite following the directions to shake and hold straight up and down no product will come out. You can tell that there is something in there but it will not come out, and seller did not respond to inquiry.",0
It personally does not keep my face moist for more than an hour. I have to re-apply more than twice a day. Gold Bond has worked better than this for me.,0
Color stays on very well and it's a safe choice!,1
"This product is not what I expected.  It is very grainy and rough, and I am not sure it is good for my skin.  I would not recommend it.",0
"I purchased this product in my long and drawn-out quest for finding a natural hair clay that doesn't have an offensive smell.  I started off with the Aveda Men's Grooming Clay.  The Aveda worked great, but I couldn't deal with stinking of patchouli all the time -- I work in a relatively professional environment and the patchouli smell really made me stand out.  People assumed I was dirty or a hippie, which I am, but I don't want to smell like it!

So I found this Clay... which has the scent of Tobacco Flower -- sounds romantic and masculine, right?  It smells great, but it is more like the smell you would excpect to come from Rick James hair in 1982.  I find this product to be completely inappropriate to wear unless you are some type of stripper or exotic male dancer.",0
Caused irritation on my skin and I CAN'T RETURN IT. Spray for 'Baking' on your skin is stupid and doesn't work. Just like spraying water on your face only it has chemicals in it. Powder is WHITE. Mine as well use baby powder!,0
Works well but dries my hair out a little. I follow up with  conditioner and coconut oil and it seems to be fine,1
"LOVE THIS lotion, feels  great and really soaks into your skin. Leaves it extra smooth.",1
Creates nice loose wave curls,1
Great for dry skin,1

It's very concentrated so you don't need a lot (even with hair that's more like cotton candy than real hair after all the processing). Leaves my hair soft and more ash-blonde than yellow, which is what I wanted. It's lasted me several months so far and when I need more, I'll definitely order this again.",1
If it weren't so expensive I would give it five stars. I've been using it exclusively on my top lip lines for three weeks now and I have seen an improvement!  My lines/wrinkles are not gone but they are noticeably diminished so I'm thrilled. I followed the instructions to put it on after I wash my face morning and evening.  I let it dry and then add my SPF moisturizer and CC cream.  I'm a believer.,1
"I had trouble with my scalp itching like crazy for months and scalp breakouts. My stylist recommended this shampoo and I haven't looked elsewhere! It smells wonderful, leaves my hair shiny and healthy and best of all, no more mad itches and breakouts!",1
"This razor is magnificent in it's engineering, a work of art.  Saying that I encountered a problem after 1 week of using the razor, the adjustment head began to loosen.  It loosened to the point where it would shift during shaving.  I kept it at the 1.5 setting by the end of the shave it had shifted up to almost 2.5.  Although it is a marvel from an engineering standpoint they should have designed a click setting to ensure it stays at the desired setting.  Maybe the razor I received was a fluke but moving a whole setting is unacceptable.  Too bad as I really tried to look past the issue but to constantly keep checking to see if the setting moved  is not something that is desirable for a razor of this caliber and price.",0
"i like this curling iron, i just bought the wrong size.  Should have returned for a smaller one,  but i threw away the packaging.  The quality is good",1
"I purchased this product from Amazon and it arrived in January 2017.  I have loved the BaBylissPro brand but the product has only lasted one year. It turns off and on during use and is not a reliable flat iron.  I have ordered another one from Amazon to be delivered today at full price and hope it does not disappoint.  If so, Ill have to order elsewhere.",0
"Simpsons jokes aside, I read all the great reviews, but can't join in the heaping praise for this product.  Disappointing.
I've used several different pre-shave products with different degrees of success, but this was the least effective one I've tried.

The only effect it had was flattening my lather a bit which made my shave WORSE and gave me razor burn.
I cannot understand how there are so many 4- and 5-star reviews of this product.

PROS:
-Does not clog razor
-Mild cooling effect
-Nice looking bottle

CONS:
-Pretty thin stuff. Minimal protection against cuts and razor burn.
-Made my lather thinner.
-Smells like KY liquid. (More on that below)
-Made my shave worse than using no pre-shave at all.
-One of the most expensive pre-shaves available

I was very excited about this product.  I said to myself ""Wow, so many great reviews!  If John Allan can sell this stuff for 13 bucks an ounce he must have really figured out the whole pre-shave thing!""

NOPE.

It smells like water-based 'intimate lubricant' and thinking about it, I'm convinced that this stuff is just glycerin (like KY liquid) with some herbal scents and tea tree oil for a cooling effect.
If I really did like this stuff, I'd buy a whole quart of glycerin for half (under 12 dollars on this site) of what this 2 ounce bottle costs, and add my own scents and oils and whatnot.
I shave with a Merkur Futur with Feather blades, and a Shavemac badger brush with Taylor of Old Bond Street cream.  I have mildly sensitive skin and have to be careful to avoid razor burn.
I tried using a little, moderate amounts, and truly excessive near-handfuls with varying degrees of face wetness. Nothing helped.",0
"I purchased this product at a salon by the recommendation of 2 stylists. I also paid nearly $50 there, not worth it!! It makes my hair more oily. The only thing I do like is, that it smells nice!",0
"Great experience. Absorbed quickly, texture not too watery nor too oily. After 10 hours I can still feel the skin smooth and moist. Saved my life in the cold and dry winter in NY. The smell could have been more pleasant though......",1
This color is great and it goes on very well! I have bought other colors from this brand that apply poorly and scrunch up after being put under the LED but this one works like a dream!,1
"Gel is as advertised, at a great price. Pump bottle however does not work so it is basically unuseable.",0
"Aerosol not working, product dribbling out",0
Still using it twice a day.....can't say if it's really doing it's job.,0
False advertising. Product wasn't luxurious. It felt diluted. Packaging was ok. I'm convinced the product was diluted. It did nothing like the other reviewers said it would!,0
Very disappointed with this product. This plus CND vinyl Polish did not last 3 days.,0
Tried this because it was on sale and less expensive than the Anthony cleanser I typically use. Broke out within a couple of weeks and had to toss it.,0
I really don't get the excitement over this mascara.  I keep trying it and it really doesn't do anything for me.,0
still a little bit oily for my skin but I love the product and you don't need a big amount of product so it lasts a lot,1
Bought this at Ulta on sale because I wanted a purple lipstick. It's not purple at all; way more pink and not bright. It also doesn't stay on at all. Very disappointed.,0
This is a good shampoo. I have used a lot of oribe products and I love them all. The price is just too much for the amount of product. This is literally a deluxe sample size.,1
"The cream I received was yellow and burned on application. The tube was also extremely dirty and had clearance tags on it from CVS. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM ""Price2Go"" - they sell expired, dirty, unreliable products!!",0

"Super happy with my tony moly lip tints! I got them in the colors 01 and 06, the lightest and darkest colors. The package came much quicker than expected and arrived with a bunch of generous samples from the seller. I am very impressed. The tints come in the cutest packaging and taste lightly sweet when on the lips. They become more vibrant the longer you keep them on the lips and have a very nice tinting effect.",1
Daughter likes it.,1
"As a professional hair stylist, I find that I have no problems spending extra money on the best tools because I want top of the line for myself and my clients. That being said, I expected much more from this blow dryer. I bit the bullet and paid the price, followed my normal shampoo/conditioner/product routine, and was beyond excited to break this out and use it. It was LOUD enough on the first setting, there is no way I could hear a client speaking over the second one.. and turbo ? Forget about it. That's not even what upset me the most. I connected the concentrator nozzle because I like a smooth sleek style, with no frizz. 10 seconds in, and it pops off the dryer. Repeat this through my entire blow dry.. Needless to say, it is not worth the hype. I will be returning it first thing tomorrow and sticking with my Rusk Speed Freak for now.

Maybe Ferrari should focus on cars, and leave hair tools to the professionals.",0
Good light scent. Great for a quick spray or two when you get out of the shower. I pack this in my gym bag.,1
"Way too sticky. I gave it away. When you spray it into your hands, it turns into whisps of sticky, stringy stuff that is impossible to work into the hair. I even tried using a tiny bit, but it made my hair look terrible.",0
"Garbage.  I'm pretty sure this is just dish soap priced really high.  Not only have I noticed no discernible difference in my skin after using for months, but the smell makes my eyes and throat burn.",0
This is a great cleanser.,1
it may be an old Essie nail polish because it chips and comes off too easily from nails,0
"This product is amazing but when it shipped, it was leaking everywhere! Very disappointed.",0
"Not getting the results others are getting. Hair, collarbone length. Have gotten better results from drugstore serums (Moroccan oil). Sad. I had high hopes. Not giving one star because this doesn't make my hair greasy.... it just doesn't yield any results.",0
"I had read all kinds of things about pregnant women getting sun spots on their face while pregnant and how important it is to wear a face moisturizer with sun screen.  So, I started looking into different brands, I had a go to brand before I got pregnant, but it had all kinds of ingredients in it, that I read would be harmful to your baby while pregnant.  I did a search on pregnancy safe beauty products, and this popped up.  It works great and is pregnancy safe.  Not to oily, and just the right amount of moisturizing.  I'm actually buying my second tube this weekend, since my other tube is almost out.",1
love this,1
"I first experienced this at the salon & ordered a bottle of it.  But it is very sweet flowery and brings nice memories of wild flowers, but is strong.  So i find myself not using it often.",1
"I have no choice but to give 1 Star, I just used it couple of times and it made my hair even more dry and unmanageable and noticed even more shedding. I am not sure if all the reviews are accurate and I normally don't leave/write reviews. It did give a tingling feeling to the scalp but this product is not for me. I have been using Nizoral and saw good results and since I couldn't find it in stores ( usually Walmart) I ordered this shampoo. If some one know where to get my hands on Nizoral please reply or leave comment",0
Wasn't worth the price.,0
Didn't even feel drying at all. Didn't make any difference to my pimples at all.,0
Has a weird smell. It didn't work for back acne. I noticed better results with St Ives,0
"I had a problem with mascara ALWAYS getting under my eye no matter what I wear. I use this as a top coat over any other mascara and it acts as a seal and I haven't had a single issue since. I even practice hot yoga and it stays in place. So happy I found this product. Wasn't wnough for me on its own ( I have thin lashes) but it's a super too coat. Would recommend to anyone struggling with finding a mascara that stays put. Game
Changing!",1
Best hair products ever.,1
"I have been using this mask two times a week to combat adult acne and I feel like it's making a difference. I have very oily skin with random breakouts and some annoying cystic acne on my chin that never wants to go away. I'm seeing a reduction in breakouts. It's not completely gone but I'd say at least 75% cleared up and it's actually helping some with the chin cystic acne. It tingles a little bit when I put a thin layer on but I wouldn't call it painful. My skin does peel a little bit the day after use but that's easily fixed with some oil free facial moisturizer. Since my skin is so oily and I live in a very hot weather area, I am liking how it's drying my face some so I'm not so oily and shiny all the time. The tube is small but if you are careful to not glob it on, it can easily last over a month.",1
"Love this product but the pump was broken when it arrived.  Any chance I could get a replacement pump?  My apologies, the pump was broken on the 25oz bottle I bought.  The first one, the 10 oz bottle doesn't have a pump.",1
"I have always used Babyliss straighteners,curling irons, and blow dryers. I am a hairdresser and I've always loved Babyliss. This Straightner is not like any of the other ones I've had. Even when the heat is on low it is getting too hot. The ceramic is not as thick as my other Babyliss Pro straighteners.",0
"Unfortunately, this wasn't a favorite for the following reasons:

- Compared to similar pastes/water based waxes, this paste did not give the flexible hold expected.  Hair remains flexible but the style didn't hold up for very long.
- The scent is strong, so you really must enjoy it, and did doesn't fade away even hours later.
- If you have dark hair, you need to blend it really really well or the white product shows up.  By the time it is rubbed and blended and rubbed and blended, the style is a mess and needs to be redone.

I would only recommend this for people with lighter hair who want minimal hold and love the scent.  It is low shine product which is a plus!",0
"I love the product, the only bad part is comes with soo little product and there's no way to find out how much of it stuck.",1
This is not the real product but a counterfeit. The box is not the same color and the liquid in the bottle is not the same consistency as the original product. I am surprised it is sold on Amazon!,0
Love it! Makes my face feel really smooth,1
Best contouring bronzer in all the land,1
Fabulose,1
"Great color! Goes on smooth, dries quickly and chips much less than similar brands!",1
"This is the second time I've ordered this. It is a bit pricey, but it works great.",1
Don't like this iron. Takes forever to warm up and then doesn't get very hot. Curls were flat. 2 stars cus I don't absolutely hate it.. but def dislike it. Would have returned but missed the return window. Def wouldn't buy again or recommend it.,0
my go to cream - used to use Kiehls however the shave cream clogged by fusion razor- this works much better and is old school,1
"not real, does not have same consistency as the bottle i purchased from a salon.",0
wont use it any more because of bad press,0
This product does not stay on my face. I do not like the coverage.,0
Absolutely horrible. No color change after using It everyday for a week.,0
"I needed a new hair dryer for my thick, color treated hair.  I read all the reviews on this and a few other dryers.  So glad I opted with this one.  The first time I used it, it was so powerful that it knotted my hair but that was my own fault.  It dries my half in about half the time - I love it.",1
"Since I have started using this wonderful body lotion, I must say I love the fragrance and non oily feeling that I get when I apply. I use it twice daily....morning after shower and in the evening before retiring. My skin is smooth and there is a lovely aura of a fine scent which does not take away from my perfume fragrance at all. I'm hooked.",1
girls go on nuface facebook and make a post about hv they rip u off you wil get ur money bk than,0
"Honestly one of my favorite hand creams! It is so soft and I actually feel like my hands are healthier even when not currently using. I do not feel like it repairs my hands truthfully, more of a temporary softness but it does feel amazing while using it. Not very greasy, not too light.",1
good,1
Save your money,0
Makes my lips very soft and the feel of the lip balm is very smooth! It does't seem to last long on my lips unfortunately and leaves behind a white sheen. Also the tube only lasts me about a week with continuous use.,1

I ordered the NuBrilliance at Home Microdermabrasion Skin Care System from the company's website. I used the machine the first time, it seemed OK. Nothing really changed in one use. However, the wand's suction power stopped working after its first use. I called the company & they even agreed to replace the wand but yet the machine continued to be low on suction. In short, the machine did not work beyond its first use & i lost shipping charges despite having returned the product. Also, the company promised me $50 coupons for fuel/ walmart .. i did not receive any of it.

This product needs to be tested and developed further before launching. If you purchase it , you're only losing time & money. Bad product !",0
This sunscreen work the best of any face sunscreen while in Cancun!!,1
Love this palette! Great pigment and perfect colors for everyday use! and the packaging is so freaking cute! makes it 10 times even better to put on my dresser!,1
"Like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around. Its a larger amount than I expected. Ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps. They last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them. This one is very pleasant, very nice shave, lathers easily (I have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1-5 its a 2-1/2) and Im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation. I have a tough beard that grows in many directions and I would definitely recommend this soap.",1
"Too early to see improvement, but I like it so far",1
"I only wish I read the reviews on Amazon before I wasted my time on this product. The first day I used it the wand broke and I called Customer Service and they really were not very helpful so I decided to return it for a full refund. I did not buy it from Amazon I bought it from the TV advertisement. It also, made big read hickies on my neck on both sides. The products that came with it are great. I would recommend not buying this product until they improve the quality. I paid $260.97 more than the Amazon price.",0
I like all their products,1
I love this product but will not buy it online again.  I'm going to go to Ulta from now on to confirm that the dispenser can actually pump out the product.  This is the 3rd time that I've bought this product via Amazon and was unable to use it because of faulty packaging.  The first time I just dealt with it but these last 2 times I've sent it back.  Never again.  Big bummer too because I love the product.,0
The best lotion.,1
I was soo disappointed with this OPI product. My nail polish chipped worse than if I'd not used anything at all. It didn't seem to work as a base OR top coat effectively. I was able to get a refund - thank goodness at $14 for one tiny bottle!,0
Works very nicely.....like this product!!,1
It doesn't stay on very well and I would like a lighter color.,0
awesome!,1
"I was a little worried that I was going to spend my money on this product and hate it, but that is not how I feel now. I've noticed changes in my stomach area, and it seems to be much firmer there then before I started using this. I've already ordered my second bottle so I don't run out of it.",1
"The pink color advertised is actually almost clear when you put it on your nails, no matter how many coats you put on. I mixed it with a white polish, which helped, but you shouldn't have to do that. Don't expect a solid color",0
"I had high hopes for this eyeliner, but was disappointed!  You may get one eye done but will have to wait a while before enough liquid loads on brush to do the other eye.  It is made of some substance that does not go on well.  For the cost of the eyeliner, I was not impressed!",0
don't notice anything.  Sry,0
"If you have seen some of my other reviews, you're already aware that I suffer from alopecia and am looking for ways to disguise my scalp. Toppik is so expensive, and has a great reputation. So, I was excited to discover I was able to try a small 3g size before committing to a full bottle. Unfortunately, I'm not sold on the product, and am not sure I want to buy a larger size.

From all the reviews I've read and watched, it seems the best way to apply these fibers is to invest in the cap that allows you to spray them on. However, the cap doesn't fit this tiny sample bottle. So, part of my dislike may be because I am unable to apply them in the best manner recommended. I did look around the house for something I could use to spray them on with, but I couldn't come up with anything. So, I ended up watching some youtube and manufacturer videos, shaking the fibers on after making various parts in my hair, and then gently patting the Toppik to kind of put it in place.

My first problem was the color. The dark brown looks black to me (and actually has a purple tint if you try to wipe a spill up or rub it with your fingers), and it was way too dark for my hair. But aside from that, I couldn't figure out how to get the fibers to do anything but fall directly to my scalp. I am not so bald that there is nothing for them to grab on to!

Once the top of my head is completely covered with the Toppik, my hair does appear fuller because no white scalp shows through. But I was under the impression that these were also supposed to cling to my hair, and make it look like I have more hair. They definitely don't do that. And, even after copious amounts of hair spray, if I accidentally touch my scalp, the fibers move out of place and reveal my scalp. Once that happens, which is inevitable, there is no way to move them back into place. Instead, I have to waste the precious powder by applying more.

So, yeah, I guess these work alright for thinning hair. It does disguise the scalp, which creates the illusion of fuller hair unless you're up close - and how many people are really going to do anything more than give your hair a cursory glance? But, I get the same effect from using a tinted dry shampoo, and that has the added benefit of giving my hair a lot of volume, which the Toppik doesn't. Toppik is so expensive and I can't see paying for it when I prefer the dry shampoo. I may break down and give it a try with a bigger bottle and the spray cap, but until then, I can't recommend this product. At least not when shaken on to the hair.",0
Not worth the price! It's basically a gel and does not thicken hair just hardens it.,0
My husband did not like this product. We contacted Amazon for a refund. He found it to be very messy and the results were not natural looking.,0
Ive used Blinc mascara for years and love it. The product in this last purchase doesnt work right and is unusable. Perhaps it has sat on the shelf too long.,0
All Great!,1
When using this serum  I can see the skin on my face actually brighten after about a minute of applying and my skin looks this way until the end of the day.  Great product and it lasts for a long time before I have to re-order.,1
I don't know how come you can get a 4.5 stars. I never have this bad experience before! I bought two of this item and both of them are broken !!!!,0
Great product,1
It makes your hands nice and smooth,1
Love the brush.  Just wish the handle was a bit thicker.  or had a rubber grip.,1
"The blue box is stunning, each item was individually wrapped in tissue paper. As I began opening up each bottle I was over taken by the strong perfume smell. It smelled like old lady powered. I don't understand why companies have to add such harsh perfumes and smells to their products. There are customers who have sensitive skin and sensitive to smells that would like to be able to use their products. It is really disappointing that I was unable again to use a product due to the horrible fragrance choice.",0
Didn't like the smell.,0
"I love product. However product ordered in Jan 2018, BROKE 3 months after use.  Ordered a 2nd one received Last week, Jun 2018, Lasted 4 DAYS and quit working!",0
"These are the half body applications - it does not say that in the description.
Besides that, I love the product! I've tried many, many self tanners & this one has the best color and is very easy to apply.",0
"Lanza Keratin Healing Oil Cream Gel - 6.8 oz from Lanza Healing Haircare . Lanza says this beauty aid for the hair will hydrate like a weightless cream, control like a styling gel  hold is given as 7 of 10--as it creates volume, body, fullness. The firm adds that the product should be applied to damp or dry hair, will add to hair texture with strong support, healthy shine. That it will brush and comb through hair easily. Protect hair from heat, UV, infrared, environmental aggressors.  That its Phyto IV Complex blend of Abyssinian Flower Oil, Coffee Seed Oil, Acai Fruit Oil and Babassu Kernel Oil will replenish essential moisture.

This was recommended to me by my hair stylist, and I am reasonably happy with product.  Here in the American South, we are having the longest, hottest, most humid summer in recent memory, producing a lot of bad hair days, and the product doesnt hold long enough.  But it does brush through the hair easily,give my fine frizzy curly hair shine, texture and body for as long as it lasts.",1
"I don't like it....it dried out fairly quickly. Got longer run from much cheaper eye liners, this one is not worth the money",0
It is good but not long lasting,1
Excellent product.,1
Color looks different and it makes bubbles on my nails.,0
Helped with some skin issues that my 3 month old had.,1
Dried out right away and wasn't useful,0
"I like this stuff! It's like a ""mud"" or ""clay"". I only use a tiny bit to texturize my hair. It's not the easiest product to work with but it holds well without being hard and crunchy. Don't use too much or you'll feel like you have a bunch of clay in your hair. I use 2 pea sized doses and put it in my DRY hair.",1
I thought these products were only available at a doctor's office or spa. Does this mean these are knock-offs? Wouldn't trust that these are true Revision products.,0
This is a good product I was using the lighter version of hairspray but needed more hold for when I curl my hair and this did the job well,1
It's fine,1
This product is light in your hair and really keeps the frizz down for naturally curly hair.,1
"This product was referred to me by my esthetician.  I was looking for something to tighten my skin, brighten my complexion, absorb quickly, did not feel heavy, and most importantly was affordable.  This product met all my expectations.  I use it every night before bed and in the morning before applying sunscreen and mineral powder.  The cream never feels heavy, actually my skin literally drinks it up.  I have noticed that my face is softer than before and have received many compliments on tone and brightness.  I love it so much so that I purchased a jar for a friend overseas!!!",1
"I am really enjoying it. I recommend. For me, it's the best hugo boss, the duration is also very good.",1
"My husband bought this hairbrush for me as a Christmas gift.  I was very excited and gave my hair a thorough brushing, only to have my scalp itch for a solid 30 minutes afterwards.  Hoping it was a fluke, I tried again the next few days with the same result.  My hairdresser believes I have some reaction to the boar bristles in the brush, which is odd as I have never been allergic to anything!

I contacted Mason Pearson and asked if they were familiar with this type of reaction, and for a possible return of the brush.

This was their response, ""Your inquiry to Mason Pearson was forwarded to us as we are their Exclusive Distributor for the USA.
We are sorry but not being able to see your hair type and/or scalp makes an answer to your question very defficult if not impossible.
We suggest you take the brush back to where your husband purchased it and perhaps they might have a answer.""

I also contacted the seller, requesting a return and received this response,
""I apologize that you are not happy with the Mason Pearson brush. We have not heard of any such issues before. Unfortunately we are unable to accept returns on any products that have already been used. This is stated in our Return Policy on Amazon.com.""  Best Regards, Kevin Soufer, Sales Manager

I understand the policy; however, we are out $100 with a brush I can't use!  I had hoped Mason Pearson would stand behind their product, particularly if this is such a ""rare"" reaction to their brush.  I'm particularly disapointed as their response is contradictory to Mason Pearson's image as a long-standing quality product.",0
not for me i am missing eyebrow hair and this does not cover it up,0
Love it. For harsh weather it helps hydrate my skin.,1
"I love Essie nail polish, but for some reason this one chips off very easily. Maybe it's the shimmer.",0
"I am a fan of NeuLash Lash because it really works! When you first use it, eyes are itchy. But that goes away in a couple of weeks & does not come back unless you stop & start over again.

Helpful.  I need to remember to apply it twice a day.,1
Always have loved Ahava. I'm glad to see these smaller sizes!,1
"My flash and go was working really well and I needed to buy a replacement cartridge. After one use with the new cartridge, I went to use it for a second time and there was a real loud noise and big flash and now my flash and go will not work. I'm really disappointed because it's not like the system was disposable, it was a pretty penny and was working well for me until it internally failed when I replaced the cartridge. So now I'm out about $350-400 and have a nonfunctional flash and go :(",0
"My hair feels so good after using this blow dryer.  It is smooth and does not fly away.  A couple of swipes with the flat iron was all it took to polish the ends.  With my old hair dryer, my hair was beginning to look like a dandelion that was ready to go to seed!  Am wondering if the BaByliss flat iron is better than the one I'm using.  If I can avoid the cost and damage of a Brazilian Blow-out to get this same look, I'm game.",1
Did not do anything for me. The consistency and the effect of talc powder. I highly recommend the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing over this. Good luck!,0
I like this product a lot. It goes on very smooth and so far hasn't bothered my very sensitive skin. My only complaint is that it is a bit too dark for me right now since it's winter and I'm at my fairest. I think it is a great color that would be good on a lot of skin tones though and I know it will be perfect once I have just a bit more color.,1
Well designed.  Wonderful weighty feel in the hand.  A pleasure to shave with.,1
"It really works well. Very smooth on screen, does not give the sticky feeling like others.",1
"I've been using this product for a week, which I realize isn't very long--but the instructions say many people see a difference after the very first use. I see nothing. Could it be that people think this product works because they want it to (the placibo effect maybe?). I'm 42 years old, I have pretty good skin as it is, but of course I've noticed some sagging around the jaw line, the eyelids, and nasalabial folds--and I'm beginning to get a slight chicken neck (yikes). Nuface hasn't made any noticeable difference in those sagging bits. And now I'm worried that I may be doing more harm than good with this product--plus, the gel and spray it comes with contain lots of chemicals and unnatural ingredients that I normally wouldn't put on my face. So anyway, you decide for yourself but there you go...",0
wrong color  much too dark..i started with the screen light brown..when ti switched over to choices and prices it decided to make all of those darkbrown and I foolishly did not notice it...so we are stuck with it.,0
"I have never used a cleansing gel before, but I must say I'm impressed with this formula. I have sensitive, combination skin and use it in the morning before getting ready. It leaves my skin feeling soft and supple. I did not give it 5 stars because it does not foam or get sudsy, which is personal preference. However, I presume it's better for my skin that way. The scent is fresh and subtle and a little goes a long way!",1

"Complete piece of crap! I had another Solano dryer that was excellent. This one apparently was not built properly.

"This iron was so disappointing. It's hottest temp? Feels lukewarm. Seriously. My hair wasn't hot to the touch after using. And not only could it not hold a curl, it couldn't MAKE a curl. I had already thrown out the packaging so I couldn't return. This is the worst curling iron I have ever purchased. I assume mine was defective.",0

I don't want either of these in my mouth at any time.",0

"About 3 years ago, I developed a reaction to the stick anti-perspirant I used for years.  My white underarms turned orange-brown in color almost overnight.  I researched the internet and discovered&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DERMAdoctor-Total-NonScents-Ultra-Gentle-Brightening-Antiperspirant-3-oz/dp/B0000ZREXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DERMAdoctor Total NonScents Ultra-Gentle Brightening Antiperspirant, 3 oz</a>&nbsp;and bought some after reading positive reviews.  It took over 12 months using the brightening product for my skin tone to return to its natural color but once that happened, I followed the product recommendation to switch to the regular ultra-gentle antiperspirant.

Both products control wetness and odor during a routine day for me, even through hot flashes!  The product is liquid, so is wet when applied but I apply right out of the shower so by the time I've finished my hair and make up, it has dried on its own and I can dress without concern.  The downside for me is the product's price and availability only online.  It means I purchase 2 bottles at a time, which last me about 6 months (3 months/bottle).  It also means when I received a bottle that was only partially filled--which I would have rejected in a store--I was pretty much out of luck.",1

Did not straighten my hair at all - and my hair even managed to get caught in the seams (and I have used straight irons forever). I promptly sent this back,0
Came dried out in the container. Dug down about half way and found some usable product that wasn't too gummy,0
Pretty much you canno go wrong with any of the clarisonic products. I have ordered these refills for the last 3 years. Love it.,1
"A shiny case that is mirror-like needs to be opened carefully, just slip a finger underneath the front tab and lift up.  I thought it might be depressed, but it is just a lift to open.  All parts of the case are plastic, including the interior mirror.  Each shadow is a disk of a little larger than a quarter, and I have no idea how deep the pots go, so I can't say how long they will last.  The colors are complementary, feel good when applied over an eye primer with a brush, and the shadows blend well.  There was no irritation to the eyes or skin surrounding the eyes.  There is a very bare hint of shimmer to the texture, so this is suitable for day or night wear for most folks.  It was made in TAIWAN.",1
Love PCA products but not after this product. Skin is normal to dry. My face broke at with acne like I haven't had since I was a teenager. Wow! I didn't over use. Once in the morning. I will be leary of using anymore PCA products. Have appointment with Dermatologist and will ask him his opinion and recommendation. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.,0
"This is DEFINITELY NOT the same as what I get at Nordstrom or Macys at full price. It is either watered down or very old, I can barely smell it after 30 minutes at the most. Threw it away after a month because seeing it on my counter got me irritated from being ripped off here. DO NOT BUY.",0
Works great and gets extremely hot. Beautiful curls as an end result!,1
Came broken,0
To dry. Very hard to apply because the liner was very dry.,0
"I used 2 jars of this and did not see much of a difference.  Maybe a teeny bit but not enough to continue using.  Maybe had I discovered this years ago and incorporated it into my routine it would make a difference but I think genetics win in my case.  Product goes on smooth and has not much scent so it's nice, but just didn't seem to work for me.",0
Wonderful,1
"I love Mario Badescu as a brand, and this gel cleanser is gentle and works as a nice basic cleanser. Mario Badescu is more expensive than regular drugstore brands, but the Enzyme cleanser is still only $12 for a huge 8 oz. bottle (even on Amazon!).

I wouldn't call this an amazing product, but it does give me a decent amount of chemical exfoliation, making my face really soft. Even better, it doesn't break me out, and smells really nice. The Enzyme cleanser is my ""down day"" cleanser; I use it interchangeably with my all-time favorite (but outrageously priced) Uriage Hysac cleansing gel, usually either in the nighttime, or when my skin is behaving really, really well and I don't need Hysac to save me (as it always does).

The texture of the cleanser itself is almost gelatinous, and a translucent green with some sort of shimmer throughout. It is purely a gel, and unlike shower gels, it does NOT lather up or foam. I usually just squirt a little on my hands and rub it evenly into my wet face, massaging it in for about a minute before washing it off. Make sure to splash your face with cold water before you dry off!

My only problem with it is that it contains methylparaben, which doesn't really matter THAT much to me, but may bother some people. The other ingredients, like most Mario Badescu products, seem natural and plant- or fruit-based, which I love.

I have an affinity for gel cleansers they are perfect for oily skin. Unlike cream cleansers, which can contain comedogenic oils, gels are great for oily skin types like me. I would suggest staying away from them if you have dry skin, though; oil-free cream-based or liquid-based cleansers are great for dry skin. The Enzyme cleansing gel is perfect for oily, breakout-prone skin, and it is also gentle enough to use on a daily basis.",1
"Was introduced to Pevonia when I went to a spa. The lady recommended this cream for my sensitive skin, and paired with Aloe it does wonders! Goes on smoothly and smells nice, but I definitely need something more heavy duty for nighttime.",1
Amazing lipstick- stays on And bright all day. Received many complements on it,1
"Overall, I like this foundation. I do have to watch out, because it can easily be applied too thick and then it does look like I've caked some make up on my face. But using a light amount it looks pretty good and lasts throughout the day. It also doesn't irritate my skin or make my skin break-out, which is a real issue for me.",1
"At last an eye product that delivers exactly what it promises.
This two part system is a patch and a vial of activation fluid.
The soaked patch is placed where 'crow's feet' wrinkles are, and just relax for 10 minutes. After rinsing, pat dry and apply serum.

If you don't have a high quality serum, you need to invest in one, and it is an important investment.

All the above is the good news. Now the bad news.
You get a good result, but it needs upkeep. And it isn't cheap.

Back to the good news, it works.",1
"I have used these foot products for a couple of years.  I decided to try Gehwol Extra for itching between toes and on the sole of my left foot.  So far, so good.  These products are a bit ""pricey"" but really money well spent.  My feet are smooth with, eh, say semi regular use and I wear sandals at least 9 months out of the year without concern for how my feet look.",1
Great on my hair. Makes it soft.,1
"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1
"I don't have noticeable wrinkles on my face, so I use all my anti-wrinkle products on my hands, and feet.
According to StiVectin I should have noticed an immediate change and then a long-lasting softening.
I noticed neither.
Complete waste of time and money.",0
Its counterfeit :/,0
"Did not like this cream, dried my skin out.",0
The product feels good but has a prevalent sweet honey smell that had I known would not of purchased.,0
I like it,1
The original. I love this scent and get compliments on how nice I smell all the time.,1
Favorite color!,1
No suds and the smell is OK but your skin will feel soft after one application. This large bottle will last for a long period of time.,0
"This s*** really works guys. Seriously.

One thing to consider is if you are starting to pepper grey in your hair. If so, you obviously won't have the greying on top where you use the product. But if you are like me, the peppering isn't too noticeable yet. (I'm not sure if they make a product that could match peppered hair color)",1
Good product just not for my hair. Too think to hold well.,1
"I have used many products to combat KP - Lanate, Neostrata Ultra Smoothing Cream, even tried Microdermabrasion, but nothing compares to this kit. I use the body wash with a Salux Nylon towel and apply the lotion twice daily and within 3 weeks my arms are so much clearer. I also use this kit on my legs because I get laser hair removal and the chemical exfoliation helps draw the hairs out of the follicle. Love how smooth my skin feels after using this!",1
"THE NAIL POLISH IS SO THIN, CAN NOT BE USE.  IT SEEMS TO BE RIGHT COLOR, HOWEVER THAT DOESN'T HELP.",0
"I've been buying the Ouidad Define & Shine gel for several years, and it's a great product. Previously I would mix regular hair gel with conditioner and silicone serum to get the same effect, but this is less messy and more exact.  My only beef with this product/seller is that Ouidad no longer makes the Moisture Lock Define & Shine gel that comes in the blue bottle, and what I received was Vital Curl Gel in a green design bottle.  The official Ouidad website only shows the green bottle Vital Curl product, so I guess it's a replacement.  However, this seller should update their photos to reflect the new product.",1
Great product and received in a good timely manner.,1
"This stuff is amazing! Creates a nice texture, and lifts roots up immediately. Great for people like me with thin, flat hair!",1
"I really wanted to like this stuff, especially after reading all the rave reviews. I don't mind spending a little more for a quality body wash, but my issue with Molton Brown was that I had to use about twice the amount I normally use to clean my entire body. Though I only shower a few times a week, this still gets to be an unnecessary expense after a while. Plenty of other natural, manly body washes out there.",0
"Really Good. I love this stuff. But, expect dilution.",1
it was spilled everywhere in the box,0
Expensive but not useful because it's take longer time to dry hair.  It's not hot at all.,0
Way too bright!!,0
I purchased this product because my hair is treatment damaged. I didn't think it worked any better than my regular conditioning products from a well known brand found in most if not all stores. It worked fairly well but not worth the purchase price.,0
I have been using this product for 3 years now and absolutely love it. I like a natural look and want to look like my skin is naturally flawless....which it is not. this power does just that!,1
"Very nice product. Color lasts a long time and is very moisturizing. Personally, I would like the color to be less pink but I took a chance ordering on line. Would definitely buy again.",1
"A gift for my daughter. No complaints, she did the did the research before I bought it and was pleased with the performance",1
"Product arrived damaged and leaking.  The gold leaf/paint on the cap and edge of the bottle was also damaged (bubbling) from the leaking of the content (appeared as though it could have been stored in a hot warehouse for a long period).  I had purchased this as a gift to give to my father, but the damage meant I had to go to a retail store and buy a clean and new looking bottle.  Next time I won't risk it, because Amazon will not let you return this item.  Every time I tried to register a complaint to return, I would get a pop up that said due to the nature of the product it can not be returned.  I did send Amazon and email with pictures of the damaged product, but did not hear back from them.",0
"I've been using this shampoo for a week now and I absolutely LOVE it.  My scalp is extremely problematic especially in the winter when it's cold and dry in the North East.  I have Sebhorreic Dermatitis, which causes an oily inflamed scalp that itches and produces large patches of flakes, which is visible along the hairline.  It's extremely embarrassing and I've tried ALL types of shampoos including prescriptions, SLS free, baby shampoo, tar, jojoba oil infused, and even Cetaphil bar soap, but nothing has helped until now.

I lather up twice massaging it into my scalp each time then follow-up with Herbal Essences moisturizing conditioner,and it truly has made a big difference.  The flakes are not 100% gone, but I would say at least 75-80% and my scalp does not itch as much.  I'm hoping that with continued use the flakes will be 100% gone and my scalp won't be as oily.

I took off one star because this small bottle is pricey.  It'll probably only last a month with everyday use, but because it's the only thing that actually works for me, I'll continue to buy it.  If anyone has found something similar, but cheaper, please let me know!",1
This product really cleans the skin and removes make up and oil. It takes some getting use to for a week or so.,1
I like it alot! Works great! Would recommend!,1
"Did not like this product, it tends to bead up on my skin.",0
I love Mustela products (generally speaking) but this cream's scent is far too strong for a product intended for sensitive skin.  I can't really speak to the long term performance of this product because I simply couldn't get past the scent and didn't want to use it on my little one.  A reformulation may be in order if Mustela wants a better seller on their hands.,0
I'd give a zero if that was an option.  No color.,0
"I like this for the ends of my hair, mostly. I use something less moisturizing in the rest. However during winter, when the central heating is on, my hair becomes full of static and this is a great help. I spray a bit in my hands or on a cotton ball and smooth the fly-aways down.",1
Did not see any difference or improvements.  Wish I did for the price I paid.,0
bottle was broken when I opened the package,0
This is the second time purchasing this product and the wife loves it.  Plan on purchasing again when empty. Thanks,1
"I would have liked a black one instead of red and white because I color my hair
and the color comes off on the white base so it will be very unsightly in a short
time.",0
don't waste your money - the teeth fall off and the company nor Amazon will back it. $100.00 - you would think it would last more than a year and a half. total rip off,0
Keeps my skin hydrated but I wish there was an unscented option.,1
I was excited to try this based on all the positive reviews it had. When it finally came in the mail I absolutely fell in love with this! I was very careful not to put a lot of pressure on it while using it and it curled all my lashes (even those stubborn ones near my tear ducts) perfectly and they stayed curled all day! But one day I put a little too much pressure and the flap in the back (where you press down to curl) broke. I was pretty upset because there goes $10 down the drain. But since this was the first eyelash curler that worked so well with my lashes I ordered a new one. Four months later I broke it again but this time when it snapped the entire back flap broke off and flew off onto the table which was scary since it was so close to my eye. Even though I absolutely loved this curler I will not be purchasing this again. for $10 they should work on making this less easy to break. Perhaps make the curler out of metal instead of plastic.,0
"I purchased this toothpaste after seeing it advertised in Instyle.  Used it a few times and noticed it foamed up much more than my old favorite (Burts Bees Lavender Mint) when my sister (who is a registered dietician) noticed that the first ingredient listed is Aluminum Hydroxide.  She firmly stated that Marvis toothpaste should be tossed into the trash since Aluminum causes Alzheimers.  Oh well, there goes my $9.00.",0
"For 30 dollars I expected to get two since that's what it said but I got one, am I going to get the other one soon? Very upset",0
"I've always had super greasy hair and have tried to find the right shampoo for years to solve that problem, this shampoo definitely does, my hair isn't greasy at all and feels amazing for a few days even without washing, only downside is it gives me bad dandruff too, I've learned to use head and shoulders in between washes and it seems to do the trick.",1

Bought this exactly 3 yrs ago. love the way it straightened my hair but it stopped working and will not come on at all anymore. For the price I paid and not using it but 1-2 times per week I believe it should have lasted me much longer. Giving it 2 stars for this reason. Very disappointed.,0
"So it is filled with propylene glycol, which all wet deodorants are, I guess.  Not it's fault.  But I pitched it. Smell is decent but somewhat sticky sweet on me.",0
This was a beautiful color but not worth the price. I bought this in teal the cows come home. 2 applications is enough and color is not opaque. It is a beautiful color for my peacock obsession. The problem lies in the price. I've heard good stuff about this brand but for the price I expect it to last. I painted my nails at night and they dried completely. The next morning I had 4 chipped nails! Not acceptable when I have used $2 nail polish that doesn't chip for 4 days. Simply not worth the price.,0
DO NOT ORDER - it says 4.2 oz and you only get 1.5 oz!!!!!,0
Don't recall buying or receiving this product.,0
"I used this one day at 11:00. Was sitting outside around 2:00 for 45 minutes and got sunburned. I've never had an issue with any other sunscreen, this didn't work.",0
It's a great Mascara and it last all day --  and easy to remove,1
"I like this stuff. Some other folks have pointed out that they feel like it's a bit ""oily"" or ""greasy"" - I actually think it lacks any of the usual sunscreen greasiness, and I think what they're noticing is the silicones. This does feel like it sits on stop of the skin a bit, but it feels more like a moisturizing makeup primer to me. I have combination skin and that doesn't bother me - I just put a bit of translucent powder over my t-zone and wear it like it's makeup. It's easy to put on and I feel like I can put on a pretty sizeable amount and still have it blend nicely - I have really fair skin and that's not always the case with tinted sunscreens for me! The tint works perfectly - really subtle, doesn't turn me orange, just prevents any white cast.

That said, I've only been using this in fall and winter. It's very possible that I'll have to look for something that sinks in a bit more for the summer.",1
This came damaged and I want a replacement with out me haveing to pay to send it back.,0
"I don't know what the difference could be...but I've purchased this product elsewhere and absolutely love it. However, I found it cheaper here so I purchased 3 cans, and threw them all away. It didn't work AT ALL for me...almost like they forgot to put the ""color"" in the spray. I'll have to pay more, but I'lm going to purchase elsewhere.",0
"Oh my, that cord is long enough to dry the neighbors hair!!  Wrapped 75% of it in rubber band.  Great dryer, attachment falls off easily.",1
Gives her a thundering headache.,0
"I like this curling iron. The only thing I don't like is that the grip gets hot as well. Burned myself a couple of times, but once I figured it out, I have had no problems.",1
"For the price, I'm not entirely satisfied with this brush cleaner. It's supposed to sanitize, and even though I used a small amount, I still felt like my brushes were oily instead of when I normally wash them with hand dishwasher soap and little bit of olive oil. The scent is a bit on the strong citrus side, which didn't bother me.

My brushes lost hair though because of this, it even ruined one of my brushes completely. I tried soaking a large powder brush (just some of the hair, didn't drench it) and all of the hairs came lose! It was from a set, and luckily I was able to get a replacement.

Since I bought such a bit bottle though, I guess I'll try to use it a little bit for ""heavy"" sanitation, but I'll need to be careful so that it doesn't ruin any more brushes.",0
"Liked the product, too bad it was broken. Useable but not much. It's a good highlighter.",0
This burns!!!!!,0
I'm allergic to everything - but not this!  I also never get sunburned with it.  Put it on in the morning under my makeup and it works great.,1
"I rcvd a sample in one of my subscription boxes (Glossybox/Popsugar) At this time the Best 'shampoo' (Yes, it's Condictioner) I have ever used. I'm buying this ASAP. Keeps my hair manageable, soft, nice shine and smells wonderful ! One bottle does it all. No large amount needed to cover/clean my thick hair. I will buy again and again",1
Didn't work,0
"I love Borghese as my go to daily wear bath and perfume products.  The fragrance is clean and it stays with me even on the hotest of days, I continue to smell good and I like that.  It is the best product for layering starting with the bath gell and continuing with the lotion and perfume.",1
love this product,1
I ordered this July 16 and it quit working September 22. The red light just blinks and the curling iron no longer becomes hot. Unacceptable and unable to return.,0

eh doesn't rly do anything tbh. except bother your skin.,0
This lotion really works well on the hands and feet and doesn't feel greasy after a couple moments.  Anthony products really are amazing and worth the extra you'll pay for it.,1
Unfortunately my skin didn't respond well to this but LOVE PCA skin products. I have VERY SENSITIVE skin and this just didn't improve things for me and after trying just experienced problems.,0
"Got a little bald spot on the top of my head (obviously the start of MPB), so I started using Toppik. It does a great job of covering the spot. Im going to start propecia soon as well.",1
"Even though you apply this with a sponge, it is not heavy.  Gives a smooth appearance with no caking or heavy application involved.",1
Not what I expected it to be.,0
"I love Onesta Playpaste. I have used it for about 3 years. I have ordered it online through several distributors via Amazon; this particular one I bought is ""hard."" The paste is hard, not the usual texture and quite frankly, sub par. This is not Play Paste as it is, or it's a very old product. Unhappy.",0
It was ok not that good as I thought,0
I have very thin hair that is frizzy.  Ive tried so many products and am usually diappointed.  This thickening spray is awesome.  It doesn't have a heavy smell and it doesn't seem that you can use too much.,1
"Works well, does not leave hair too oily. Clear & rinses easily",1
Had an old  smell to it :(,0
"It lasts forever, which is great. I don't think it's a miracle cream or anything, but my eyes look better and feel much more supple than before I used this. I've used it for two months so far, every day.",1
"It did not curl my hair at all, no matter how much product I would put in hair before or after.",0
My all time favorite highlighter!!!!,1
I found that my low metabolism was more related to adrenal fatigue and went to an acupuncturist. I gave these a try. In the end they were too expensive for herbs.,0
"Cute color. I like all the balms' matte series. I love matte liquids in general. The color is a soft coral, but gets darker with application. It wears long, but it's not oil or kiss proof. I recommend using powder underneath it so it does last longer. It goes for about 4 hours without powder. Little longer with it.",1
"Love this product! It really helps freshen up your hair. It has a bit of a ""lemoney"" smell to it. I took one star off because the product can make dark hair look a little whitish if the product is not blended in well enough and because at times the powder is so fine that it can kind of get all over the place. Overall I really like the product and will continue to purchase!",1
"Its more of a powder than hair fibers. With the small bottle being hard to manage, it comes out too much at a time and is very course in hand.not what I expected",0
"This makes my hair soft and controlled. Not crunchy, not oily. Just nice. Love this product.",1
"This product smells like seaweed.  I hate putting it on for that reason, so I keep avoiding it.  It will probably sit on my shelf forever.  I never really notice a huge difference in shine either - so not worth walking around with smelly hair.  I won't buy again.",0
"Unfortunately I ordered 3 of these because I was drawn in by the low price. Big mistake. It's hard to describe the smell but it is VERY strong and kind of like dish soap. Someone's idea of clean and fresh but not mine. I was thinking it might be similar to Philosophy's Pure Grace but Nooooooo.
Unless you really like dish soap/floor cleaner smell I would skip this one.",0
"I have normal skin with a slightly oily t-zone, and this cleanser works very well for me.  You need only a tiny amount  less than pea-sized  to work up a creamy lather on your face and neck.  It rinses easily and leaves my face with that squeaky-clean feeling that I love but without that tight, dry feeling that I can definitely do without.  The product has a very light, barely-there fragrance that I find pleasant (it doesnt linger once youve rinsed your face).  Ive experienced no redness, irritation, dryness or breakouts.

Theres nothing too impressive about the ingredient list  pretty much what you find in most mid-range cleansers.  Since you need to use so little of the product, the 4.2 oz. size should last quite a while.  I would consider purchasing this item again.",1
Thank you. I love it.....,1
It leaves your skin refreshed.,1
"It's expensive, but smells great and feels like it works well. Not sure if I'd buy it again though. I use it with the conditioner as well.",1
"Not as good as discontinued Pravana product, but a darned close runner up for a good price.  A few sprays (don't overdo it) and your dry hair gleams!",1
"Ordered the product and got the coupon voucher for $20 in a few days that I could only use to buy their other products. So I went on to order a cologne but the item was back ordered for 2 months and they finally cancelled that order and my voucher disappeared with it. They never reissued the voucher. By the way, this product should not cost even $5. Theyre like a kit in a luxury hotel for guest!",0
"Not in a very effective spray bottle. Actually poured it into an empty bottle of a different facial spray with a better mister.  This one kind of splats a small area with a lot of spray instead of a wider, even spray.",1
Very easy to use and looks great!,1
The Best,1
Good for stiff holds,1
I would do without the glitter in the polish. It was a great color and amazing for summer. Great part of the summer collection.,1
"This is an authentic product.
I have been using this for years.  Very pleased that received product was as wonderful as it has always been.",1
I really like the richness but my face feels slightly dry after using it.,1
"Using my husband's account:
Not worth the price. Could get the same trype of curls with much cheaper curler. Not as easy to use as it seems to be.",0
Did not do anything special for my KP otherwise a nice soap but overpriced for what it doesn't do,0
"I really like this makeup remover.  Leaves your skin clean yet gentle enough for sensitive skin.  Never greasy.  I gave it four stars instead of five because it doesn't remove waterproof mascara completely.
More important for me was the conditioning of my skin from using this product.  I really like it.",1
"I'm not one to paint my nails a lot any more, after I had kids it was just too hard to fit a time in to do so, but now they're practically grown and I'll get bored and paint my nails, my daughter had a subscription to this Julep company and every month she'd get surprise polishes in the mail, she ended up with about 19 colors. I am far from an expert on nail polish, I have no degree, or even understand the science behind making polish, however, with that said, my mother was a cosmologist, and I know enough to know good quality from bad quality polishes.

Over the years I've used a variety of brands, when I was a teen ""Wet & Wild"" was my favorite , I've used my moms high priced ones as well.  But when it comes to Julep I would never pay $14 bucks for it, it's horribly made! it's so liquid, it streaks even when putting on a extreme thin layer , I put on about 4 coats and finally just gave up and gave into streaky finger nails. I had a very hard time even getting it off about  3 days after I painted my nails - Nail polish remover with acetone didn't want to take it off, I had to use a lot of ""elbow grease"" to get it off.

I am very disappointed because she has 19 different colors, But for now I'll just stick with my 1 color of Sinfulshine, because it's 100x's better!",0
Love the color but my only disappointment and maybe if I had read the fine print I would have noticed that the plub is a USB plug not a regular outlet plug.  For some that might be perfect but for me I still want the regular outlet plug.  Thank goodness I kept my old one,1
"Sadly, the initial scent was my familiar and much loved Savannah Garden, but then there was a really awful sort of plastic smell.  It was so bad that I had to wash it off my hands and arms because it was keeping me from falling asleep.  I was very disappointed.  The 2 star is because it arrived quickly.",0
perfect for short thin hair,1
I really love these eye gels and think that they do make a difference. I'm giving this particular product 4 stars instead of 5 as I prefer the individually packaged pairs.,1
No matter how much or little I use I'm getting that white film.  It looks like I had old lady powder in my face.  I'm going back to super goop.,0
"Dries out pimples really well. Helps them come to a head if they have not yet. I like that I can truly spot treat because since my face is dry from all the acne products I don't to apply spot treatment anywhere but where I need it. With creams although I try to spot treat it ends up being a larger area than the bump site. I am very happy with it. Will continue to use it. I don't know that it works any better than when I use the Proactiv sulfur mask as a spot treatment. I will put a dab of that on a pimple before bed and it dries it out pretty good the next day. And it is much cheaper since it comes ""free"" with the proactiv 3 piece kit. But even so I bought this and I like it and still would buy it again.",1
Love this.  Got this on a cruise and loved it.  This is my second jar.  You only need a little.,1
works well,1
Too small,0
"My haircutter said my curly, color-treated hair would benefit from shampoo with no sulfates:  less color loss and frizz. Sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate make shampoos foam.  And evidently they clean by stripping oils.  Ooo, not good.  I was willing to forego the foam.

But sulfate-free shampoos are hard to find. (Check salon shampoos - most have sulfates.) Those I did find smell like a bakery. No thanks, I'll eat my doughnut, not smear it on my head in the am. (Okay, I'll grant that eating doughnuts is probably worse for my hair overall than sulfate shampoos. But one thing at a time.)

Pureology smells fresh and piney.  Just a SMALL amount does it and it lathers very well. Seriously, squeeze the amount you're used to and you'll rinse til tomorrow. But the key: my demi-permanent grey-covering color HAS lasted longer AND I've experienced much less frizz.

Is this the best sulfate-free shampoo out there?  Are sulfate-free shampoos really needed? (Several Web sites will tell you it's a racket.) Is the silicone in it bad for you?  Can't say.  But given the pleasant scent, my results, and the size of this jug, I won't be shampoo shopping in 2008.",1
"Tried using this and I really liked it, however it was a little thick for me even to use at night.  I prefer the Bioelements Absolute Moisture.",1
"I did not like this product at all.  Using the product as described, I would only have gotten 5-7 washings out of it.  I returned the product, and UPS picked it up at the building I live in.  Then, They recharged me for the product.",0

"""CAUTION: YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS! I did try to return it and was told it was non-returnable. I did not like it at first (too dry), but after putting it on with a moist sponge, the good news is I think it's OK. HOWEVER, I do prefer Olay's 7 tinted moisturizer

Despite some glowing reviews, I would have to drop this to a 2 star... I really wanted to like it...but it is heavy and NOT a tinted moisturizer on my face. If you have mature skin, head for a true tinted moisturizer. This is more like foundation.",0
It makes my skin very dry.,0
"It effective at killing acne. It also leaves a weird, white powdery streak where it is applied.",0
Don't waste your money. This tool doesn't do anything different from a $19.95 curling iron. My tool is losing teeth from the slightest movement or touch. I bought into the infomercial looking for a miracle tool for my hair. This was a disappointment.,0
Its a good flat iron..but i had to wait three more days to be delivered..,0
Seems to work very well heard a lot of positive feedback on glytone products. Little goes a long way.,1
"I found this brush at Ulta. I'm not a big fan of it. I ended up with more bristles on my face than product. I gave it a 2nd try. Then a 3rd try, the bristles still stuck to my face. I figured a $30 brush would have some more quality to it. Very disappointed. I will be returning it today.",0
"It has quite a bit of white cast and is not as moisturizing as it is supposed to be; that was my biggest problem with it, because I have dry skin and while it didn't make it drier, it also didn't make it more moist, actually leaving it white-ish, chalk-like and dull looking.",0
This is very nice to use! This helps the smell of the perfume last longer as it does not last all day!,1
Not impressive enough to buy again. Very messy when going on. Wears nice and washes off nice. But my lashes look no different than other mascaras Ive used,0
not very good  conditioner does not work,0
This is an excellent conditioner leaves nourished and beautiful hair. My hair is long and perfect to comb and dry easily.,1
Honestly I was very disappointed it feels very cheap I am going to see how the case holds but I feel that it's not the 20something I paid for. M.A.C has a less inexpensive one and and it's really nice.,0
Stopped working after a week or so of use. Returned,0
"This is what I ordered, but there packages are marked wrong!  Instead I rec'd Moi Moi hair masque??  The sticker on the product says that it is the L'anza Healing colorcare silver  brightening??",0
Smells amazing. Definitely a skin pick me up! Great price too. I'm going to buy a spare for my purse.,1
Did nothing for the redness of my hair. I dye my hair pretty frequently and unfortunately it does turn brassy pretty quickly. This did nothing to remove the brass from my brown colored hair.,0
"I have been looking for a perfect all-in-one palette to travel with and purchased this to see if it would fit the bill. I can absolutely use this to travel, as it has some shadow choices, blush, bronzer/contour and highlight. I was really disappointed in the gold color. The payoff is not great, in my opinion, especially to some other golden shadows I have had and used and loved. This was my first Lorac product. I definitely liked it, but I wasn't 100% totally blown away by it. The packaging is a cardboard-type, which is fine, but the light pink gets dirty so quickly and easily which is definitely a bummer. So I wouldn't say it is my ultimate perfect travel palette, but I will say it is definitely an option. The price is good, and I got it on sale so it was even better. It has all the elements i need and I can add pops of color with my colourpop liners.",1
Awesome love this red blow drier . Nice and easy.  My hair don't smell like smoke don't get frizzy. like my elchim,1
"Contrary to the belief that oils break you out, I found this oil is easily absorbed into my dry facial skin and does not cause me to have any breakouts.  The oil doesn't irritate or leave my skin flush.  I find the fragrance subtle and not cloying.  Only a small squeeze worth of product and the oil dispenses easily.

I use after removing my makeup and before heading to sleep.  In the morning, my skin doesn't feel oily, just well balanced.  I plan to continue using as part of my routine, especially as the fall/winter season approaches, where my skin tends to get dry/flaky easily.",1
I read about this product in a magazine.  When I went to a new beauty shop the stylist used this on my hair.  We talked about this product and I was really pleased with the results.  I then looked it up on the internet and found the best deal.  I received it in a couple of days and have been using it ever since.,1
Great stuff! I will definitely be buying this again. Combined with my conditioner this makes my hair look like I'm a 90's teen throb. It's worth every penny.,1

It is an excellent dryer and it does the job however, this is the third dryer that fails in the same manner. The most recent one that I purchased, I've had for only six months and it already died on me. Previously I thought that it was normal wear and tear until this last one. It starts out with a whining noise and gets louder and louder. There is also an odor of burning plastic due to the fan blades rubbing on the plastic housing.  I had to have my husband open it up to see what was causing this problem. He determined that the mounting holes that support the motor break and the motor and blades become loose. This causes the plastic blades to rub on the plastic housing causing the noise and burning smell.
Here is a video that shows this flaw. You can also find other videos of dryers with the same issue

"This is an impressive comb, I have to say. It is extremely solid and durable, very attractive, and certainly of noticeably higher quality than the comb I've been using for years, essentially a black plastic generic comb I bought in a grocery store or pharmacy.

My problem in trying to evaluate and review this comb is that it's currently out of stock, and there's no price information available for me to factor into the equation.

The comb I've been using for years cost me probably less than 5 bucks. If this comb is similarly priced, then it's a 5+ Star product. If it's a $20 comb, I'd rate it considerably lower. But as of now, I have no way of knowing.

So, as of now, I've given it a ""compromise"" rating of 4 Stars.",1
"like this stuff, wish the tube was bigger. kinda xpensive, seemed like a large air pocket in the tube, but OH well, prob ""by weight, not volume kind of thing""",1
"This ruined my hair. I've always had nice hair thankfully, a little oily but never dry. My hair dresser commented on a patch of my hair that was fried and said it was most likely my blow dryer. I switched blow dryers and my hair after months is finally looking good again.",0
"This is a pretty cool device.  I have this and I also have the Clarisonic alpha fit and there are some things I really like about the Luna in comparison.  For one, I like that the silicone brush does not have to be replaced every three months costing me $30.00 each time.  I also like the shape because it fits better around the nose.  I have not used this for long enough to tell if it makes a difference in my skin, but it if works as well as my clarisonic then I will be happy.",1
A friend of mine recommended it as she swore by it for her beach waves but I don't think it was worth it. I just use my Hot Tools iron and it works better. The rotating curling will turn the wrong way if you accidentally  hit the L/R button which shouldn't be so easy to do.,0
works well,1
"im not really impressed with those , i wanted to wait and see if it was my learning curve the issue but its not that , they are not as light and i really thought they won't be cakey on my skin i mean that doesnt happen often but it just showed right away .. and the colors are very pale .",0
I started using this under my makeup when I worked for a dermatologist.  It's wonderful and light.,1
"Bought 2. Opened one of the containers and the product felt like there were hundreds of tiny pieces of glass mixed in.  May have expired or wasn't properly stored.  Probably reason for deep discount.  Didn't notice it until I was halfway thru hair. Have used product for years and this is the first time I've experienced this.  Lost most of my hair in the process.

Will be dumping the other box.  Probably time to go au naturel.",0
"Bought for my son who has gotten an allergic from every deodorant we tried. did not give him a reaction, but does not work well either. Not worth $17!!",0
"This broke a month after I bought it and I couldn't return it due to one day over the return period. Do NOT buy this from this seller it is not the same as buying it from the beauty store. I bought one three years ago from a beauty supply store and I have gone back to using that one since this one is a piece of junk!! WARNING do not buy this I promise it is not the real deal!!!!!!! It is a cheap plastic and the cord is so flimsy, not a good buy and I wish I would have returned it right after I got it!!",0
"Some background: I have been doing a Korean 10 step beauty routine, or some iteration of it, for the last six months or so, and prior to that I was using facial cleanser, serum, and either a moisturizer or a moisturizing facial oil for some time, so I'm familiar with using oils and some of the strategies for making them work. For example, if I'm having a hormonal day where I feel like I might break out, I apply the oil onto my wet hands and rub it around first before applying to my face to kind of dilute the oil and keep me from breaking out. Other times when I need more moisture, I rubbed the oil onto my dry hands and apply directly.

I have tried a variety of beauty oils for the face, and I usually like ones with the most natural ingredients, though I do intersperse them with using a regular moisturizer just because I find a lot of the oils sit on my face and don't sink in quite as effectively as I might hope. That said, they provide a great barrier of protection for those days when I have to be outside more, because I work as a landscaper there are a lot of days when I am in the elements.

This oil falls short in the ingredients department into really notable ways: first, the artificial fragrance is absolutely awful. On first sniff, it's not too bad, however I'm not used to having a facial oil be fragranced. Given that fragrance is one of the primary skin irritants, and given the fact that people usually use facial oils when they have delicate, sensitive, or aging skin, why in the world would they muck up a premium product by adding such a common irritant that many people don't like? I can tell you that if I want to smell the fragrance on my skin all day, it won't be something like this  I would instead carefully select a fragranced lotion or perfume. I don't look to my facial oil to provide a fragrant ambience to my day.

Then, later in the ingredients it contains hydrogenated vegetable oil. I don't know about you, but when I cook with vegetable oil, it tends to break me out. I don't see any justification at all for putting hydrogenated vegetable oil in such an expensive facial oil product. There are wonderful facial oils on the market that are fairly inexpensive in comparison to this  definitely less than half of the retail price, that do not contain any of this junk. In addition, you can find ones for cheaper that have coldpressed or organic ingredients. Just here locally, I have a number of vendors blending up beautiful, simple facial oil blends with truly high-end ingredients and they do not charge so much money for them.

I can't speak to the long-term effects of using this oil because I couldn't tolerate it. In fact, on the first day of using, I had to wash my face multiple times to try to get the fragrance off, because it was making my face well and making me need to sneeze. The fragrance is not that bad, I am just extremely sensitive to fragrance on my skin care products. However, I use a number of Korean beauty products and even though a few of them do have fragrance, the vast majority don't have anything like this. I've also used a lot of lush facial products, all of which do have some natural essential oil fragrance, and those don't bother me either. This really smells like a drugstore shampoo, and why in the world they would put it on a facial oil, I really can't tell you.

There is some good stuff in here, but the fact that it's overshadowed by an overbearing fragrance and a few questionable ingredients, plus a lack of organic or coldpressed oils, makes me think that the price tag is just due to Cindy Crawford's name and not due to the ingredients. It's a shame. From reading the ingredients I had higher hopes.",0
This facial mask showed results the next morning right when I woke up! So noticeable!,1
"Would never order this from Amazon again.  The time I used this tube, there was something ""sickly sweet"" about the smell.  I didn't realize how bad it was until I bought another tube from Nordstrom and the smell is the fresh, clean aroma I've come to expect from Jack Black.  I think the organic ingredients spoiled while the product went through Amazon's warehouse/delivery process so while I continue to use Jack Black, I'll never order another product like this from Amazon.",0
"Works pretty well! You have to make a thing of it and set aside 20 minutes because you can't multitask or you'll drop dust all over everything. But if you do it once a week, you see results in about 2 weeks.",1
The color wssn't good for me although this was the darkest i could find. Powder is scattered under my eyes when i apply it. The brush is not that good. Not worth the buy,0
Don't buy it. Mine stop working aftwr a week. Doesn't even straighen my hair :(,0
This is definitely not the same as what I have bought from esthetician previously.  It has a Vaseline like texture and is yellow...it should be creamy and white.,0
There's not a lot to say about a body wash. This one smells particularly nice and feels gentle and like it's easy to wash off completely.,1
Jimmy Choo went very well with his chemistry. But it is  too hard to fine. It needs to be in some main department stores.,1
I have been using this serum for over 10 years. It helps reduce & prevent the appearrance of fine lines & wrinkles.,1
"I purchased the diffuser and hand soap in the same ""Ski House"" scent for our ski house! All of their home scents are amazing - they are not cheap in price, nor are the scents cheap smelling! I have several of their diffusers - love the Master Bedroom scent as well!",1
"Recently, my hairdresser bought the Bio Ionic Idry Nano I5x conditioning Pro Hair Dryer.  What a difference it immediately made to my hair.  My hair was much softer, it dried more quickly and it was much more conditioned than with a normal hair conditioning product.  I immediately went home and started searching websites for the dryer.  The best price and the easiest site to manipulate was Amazon.com.  I ordered it and I love it.",1
"I have used L'Occitane's 20% Shea butter for my hands.  They are constantly dry since I have to wash my hands at least 20 times a day.  It has been a life saver.  Before using the cream I was constantly getting paper cuts and my fingers could get rough.
So I was excited to try the body lotion.  It is a lot thinner but it also does a great job of coating my skin even after I wash it, it still stays on.  The lotion has a smooth, milky texture that glides wonderfully on the skin.  The only thing I don't like it that is has a rather strong smell that is little chemically.  If you are highly sensitive or allergic you may find it too fragrant and find yourself sneezing.
I really enjoy using this product, it is good for dry skin and retains moisture better than most lotions.",1
"I just oppened the box and what a surprise. This item is expired and whoever packed should have noticed how bad the box looks, the pads are yellow!! If someone uses this will have to straight to the Doctor! I expect full refund for this.",0
Not very good.,0
"Have used this for a few months now - and very happy with this shaver !
Weight is nice and heavy -
I shave about every 1/2 to 1 weeks, so the whisker stubble is always thick and heavy.
This shave dumps the stubble just fine.
One thing to realize - This is NOT A BUTTERFLY design, the top unscrews for blade replacement (or cleaning). I did not realize this, but for sure this is NOT A PROBLEM - I got used to it in a few shaves - Also, I think this design holds the blade better (I have used both designs).",1
"I love this hair spray, great hold with out the tacky heavy feeling",1
"I don't like the smell, and I don't feel anything different with this",0
Healed my Lobster sunburn in a day! made my skin soft too!,1
"I got it from vichy website, am using it for akready a month and got 0 difference :(

Plus it is very sticky",0
Wouldn't buy again the coverage was good but the blonde seem to have an orange tint to it.,0
"I love Proraso products for shaving.  This is my favorite ""flavor""  of shave soap because I  life the warming effect on my skin from the menthol.  Because of that, I prefer the shaving soap in the tube because the menthol seems to stay more potent in the tube.",1
Not as whitening as expected.,0
The mist is lovely. It feels great but its expensive for what it is and for the size.,1
If you are sensitive to scents-- stay away.  Leaves a greasy residue as well. I have Mac and Bare Escentuals brush cleaner and both are pleasant smelling and cleans without being oily.  Had to throw it away after testing it on one of my brushes.,0
I like my skin looks much younger and beautiful,1
I swear by this lip balm.  It goes on thick and smooth and gives a great shine.  It also last for a long time.  It is not sticky or tacky.  It's expensive but well worth it.  And it has a built in spf.  Can't beat it.,1
The best product yet!,1
Silky smooth protectant. I use it under my foundation for base + sunscreen. Perfectly matte.,1
"I would like to ask a question, not write a review. My question is, can I use this product over the anthelios 50 daily anti-aging primer? The primer absorbs oil and reduces pore appearance, just wonder if it would be to much product sunscreen on my face by using both. Thank you",0
ok,1
"I love this! Its a gloss with a hint of color. I chose red, but as you can see, its not cherry bright red. Its just right. The only bad thing is that its 0.08 oz, which is hardly anything at all. I know Ill go through this quickly.",1
Wasn't a fan. Still got burnt. I'm also transparent.,0
"this is the best... better than a gel.  a small amount will hold your hair and make it shine...also it never flakes
in my case it keeps my curls together and frizz free",1
good,1
"I cant stand this stuff, it doesn't not absorb well into the skin at all and leaves a white residue. Idk how well it works couldn't get passed the excess residue it leaves after drying.",0
"My daughter received a sample of this in her Birchbox and I immediately loved it and had to order one. However, the one that I purchased seems to wear off more quickly than the sample item.",1
I am not sure if this is the same salon formula found in retail stores. The formula per the ingrediants look different from the one I purchased from a Salon store.,0
I gave the shampoo to my mom and I kept the conditioner,1
This mitt works well to blend my tanner (its a mousse) and doesnt leave me streaky or blotchy BUT it did transfer to my hands while in the mitt. That was really disappointing. I would recommend wearing like latex gloves beneath the mitt while applying your tan and make sure to wash your hands ASAP after your application.,1
"I agree with the woman who also wrote in about receiving a false product with the code at the top- I received the same one and it has done nothing compared to the product I had used before.  I don't know how, but try and beware",0
"The mascara was amazing.  I would definitely recommend.  At the end of a very long day, it does start to flake off if you happen to rub your eyes.",1
"I was a little skeptical at first, as I always am with reviews that promise overnight results. My father and I have both been battling acne our entire lives, and we have regular chats about new products and remedies that we are attempting. Most of the time the results are either temporary or not at all. This is one product that I can say I rely on now to treat a spot immediately, and I have my father on board too. I get a combination of small pimples as well as cystic acne from time to time, and this drying lotion does treat both, although it works much better on general acne. As other reviews have mentioned there are products in the same line to treat cystic acne, I am planning to try those next. On an average pimple, the size was reduced overnight. On large or deep acne, it took 2-3 days. Read the instructions on the bottle carefully, and when it says DO NOT SHAKE, trust me, DO NOT SHAKE!!! I didn't see this initially, so I always made sure the pink sediment on the bottom was mixed with the clear layer on top. However, after some research, I read that the pink sediment is what does the trick on your pimples, and you don't want to mix it with the clear liquid.",1
It does not work!,0
"It's yummy, but it disappears pretty quickly. I also hoped that the Verbena scent would dominate but the citrus does.. It's summery and light which is what I was going for. Still love it, but next time will get the basic Verbena fragrance.",1
Very drying. Not what I expected at all.,0
Its broken ,0
I like the FREEZE & SHINE MUCH BETTER.  It has holds the hair much better.  Do you know where I can get it?,0
"Background: I am fortunate enough to be provided items from Amazon to evaluate and review. I don't think I would have purchased this product, but I was happy enough to evaluate it and provide my thoughts and opinions.

When this parcel arrived, I tossed it to my wife and told her it was for her. A week or so later, I asked her what she thought of it. She told me that I was mistaken, and that this is a man's product. I read the ambiguous packaging and couldn't find any gender-specific hints, so I took a whiff and agreed that it's scented for men. Then I looked at the Amazon page again and it appears to me to be targeted for women. I'm so confused.

Since my wife won't use this, I've been using it to shave. I wet my face, pump a few squirts of this into my palms, rub them together, apply it to my face, and then shave it all back off. My face feels no better or worse for having used this. It smells OK, and then the smell eventually fades (or maybe I become desensitized).

My two take-away impressions of this are:

1. Like I said, who can possibly tell whether this is for men or women. It's not quite androgynous, but it certainly isn't feminine either.

2. The producers must not want you to use this very quickly, because there's only about a quarter inch of travel in the pump and hardly any product is dispensed.

3. (I know I said two, but here's one more.) I don't really see any effect from this product, except to maybe cleanse the dirt off my face.

My conclusion is that this product is kind of a nothing. It's neither here nor there. And it also doesn't seem to know whom it is for. Not me. Not my wife. And I suspect not for you either, unless you need a nothing in your life too.",0
I have been using Toppik for several years. It is worth the money but you have to be careful when you sprinkle it on because it might get on your clothing. It does work nicely.,1
For the first time in my life I have strong nails.  Love the coloured version of Nail Envy. Colour is subtle but  pretty. Requires 3 coats,1
Amazing!!,1
"I spray it on and the smell only lasts about 10 min, so I really don't believe this is the real stuff.  I was disappointed after paying so much for it.",0
Not worth the $ or the credit on future products.,0
"The color is nice, however this chipped within an hour of me applying it.",0
Well made Good material,1
"I don't believe this is the ""REAL"" Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner. It leaves my hair extremely dry, like I'm applying a very cheap product. I would return had I not waited so long.",0
This product is mostly great. I don't believe it's anything too special though. Also sometimes I feel like it doesn't clean everything so I have to shampoo twice in the shower.,1
This item is very nice when you need something to finish off your styling.,1
"NOT the blind you r used to. Clumpy as all get out, hardly get any full strands to wash off (ie, no worms *any regular Blinc users know what I mean) it flakes and fades.. even if I wanted to like it, it was empty in less than 6 weeks.",0
"As someone whose idea of ""skin care"" is to use the same bar of soap on his face and his shaved head, I've always cringed at the idea of a daily face-cleansing routine.  Why?  A couple reasons:
1) Too much work
2) I don't like to have a ""special scent"".

My wife, though, is a huge fan of products like these (and that's what she calls them...not ""cleaning products"", and not ""skin care products""...just ""products""), and suggested that I might actually like using this kit.  The fact that it's ""formulated"" for men, and the fact that it is unscented, was enough for me to at least give it a shot.

End result: I like it!  The details:

1) It turns out that the cleaning routine isn't such a big deal after all (as most normal human beings can likely attest).  A couple minutes is all it takes.
2) My face feels better after the wash and toner...noticeably better than when I use my bar of deodorant bath soap.
3) Though there is a slight scent to the cleanser, it's not a scent that lingers.  No one will notice it.
4) The moisturizer is particularly nice.  It doesn't feel oily, and it's just what I need during these dry winter months.  I even apply a little to my bald head.  Even though it's supposedly made for men, my wife really likes the lotion...apparently it's thicker than most of the lotions she's used.

So, if you're like me (which would be kind of sad), and have hesitated to try out a daily face cleansing regimen, I want to let you know that it's not as bad as you might think!  This Baxter kit is a good way to go.  Basic, no-nonsense products that will leave you feeling clean, without a scent.",1
Ive tried so many volumising products and this type of powder volumizer is absolutely the best Ive found - easy to use and lasts for ages - its really good value for money,1
This product has amazing texture and volume.  I was really pleased with the overall look and feel of my hair when I use this product.,1
This stuff does wonders. Buy from Athena Beauty - they're great. I spritz this on my dry ends and us as a finishing spray. Gives hair a shiny and NOT oily look! Amazing. P.S. It smells like heaven.,1
This product dried my skin out very badly. Not worth to try and do not recommended.,0
Very gentle and works really great for my infant with sensitive eczema prone skin. We bath him everyday and the soap is moisturizing and cleansing at the same time!,1
all it does is clog my shaver and is hard to wash out,0
"The packaging had obviously been opened before.  Marks on wands. The ""on"" indicator light is very, very dim.  Switch slips grin on to off easily.  To gets loose regularly.  :(",0
It arrived before the estimated date. No problems whatsoever.,1
found it best worked at night before sleep.,1
why the big price change.,1
When I ordered this product before there was another shade-Light and it wasn't available this time so I am not really happy with the product because it is slightly too dark for my skin tone,0
"This cream smells bad, like cheap gas station soap. It is also not as good as the Anthony shave cream, or Art of Shaving. (So I went back to those, even though they are more expensive.) Another negative, Amazon would not allow a return after I smelled (but not used) this cream, even though this is an Amazon Prime item, and the return policy isn't clearly spelled out. I filled out a complaint form and eventually they refunded the purchase price, but other than that (extra work), these are all negatives for me.",0
"This product so far has done what it says it will do.  My daughter has very curly, frizzy hair and this really calmed it down and made it silky and smooth just what she wanted.  We love it!!!",1
"You only really need the fibers, none of the other tools really do anything. All the blower does is waste product cause it puffs it up in the air. It's better to just apply the product directly to your hair.",0
This product smells like powdered Gatorade. It does not provide any benefit to weight loss. I got much more success from using my phone app to track my calories and exercise. This is a huge waste of money. =(,0
"Shine is good, hold it good but the fragrance is the cause of the low rating.  Smells like a perfume my grandson would wear:( Im going to try another type by same maker.",0
"Great product!!!!  I Have really sensitive skin, this product is gentle enough, Love the clean and refreshed feel after using the pads.",1
Nice sized sample. Very nice lotion.,1
It just give me breakout !!,0
"Like its body butter pair, this body wash used to be thicker and more luxurious a few years ago. Now it feels really watered down. The first time I pumped it I thought I'd somehow gotten water into the bottle or something. It's thinner, actually, then some ordinary body washes... I was really disappointed as I used to buy this religiously and feel like a million bucks. It still has a nice fragrance and all that, but it's not worth the extra money, compared to ordinary store-brand body washes, for what you get.",0
"I have mixed emotions about this wand. On one hand I loved how it made my hair look, and it didn't take a lot of time. Sadly, only after 6 months of use, I got an ER4 error message and It stopped working. Admittedly, I purchased this from another on-line beauty site. They advised me to wipe it down and make sure no hair product or hair was on it. After doing that, it was still not working. They do not have a return policy after 6 months, so I have to accept store credit. I guess I would like this to be a warning, that for such a pricy beauty tool. (I paid $129.00), it was a big disappointment. Purchased at Christmas time, broke in June. If you decide to purchase anyway, make sure you are aware of the stores return policy, as it's likely it will stop working.  Good luck.",0
"I love this thing, it works great and lasts a long time.. I already repurchased..",1
"Not for me, didn't see what the most of the reviews say. I have curly and freeze hair. I use a professional dryer and my hair looks better without this product. I don't like the smell. I threw it away",0
"Smells absolutely fantastic, and legitimately does what it claims. I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!",1
"This formula is horrible! I use this over my toner, essence, and serum as a daytime moisturizer and it's probably the worst face cream I've ever used. It emulsifies as I rub it in, almost like the way zinc oxide sunscreens have that white cast. I pretty much have to rub it in for a good 3 minutes for it to disappear. And it also smells like plastic. I know they don't want to add fragrance to it, but use an essential oil or something to mask the smell of the ingredients. I've used organic brands before and this is the worst. I would return it but its past the window bc I waited to finish up another jar of face cream before even trying it. This is a huge flop! And their eye cream does the SAME thing. It's counterintuitive bc you don't want to overhandle the delicate eye area. Avoid this brand.",0
"I Love this line of products, though I wish the fragrance was a bit stronger.",1
Just buy it. Will post more after using it for a while.,1
The product was not sealed and dispersed in the carton completely,0
Excellent,1
"This shampoo does get your hair clean, but only after using a lot of it.  It's not at all concentrated, so it's hard to get it anywhere other than the top of your head without losing a bunch of it, and because it's so thin, the bottle gets used up pretty quickly.  It has a tendency to get in your eyes and it stings quite fiercely.  It seems more like a marketing gimmick than a shampoo made for someone with an oily scalp and dry ends; however, it does seem to keep my hair clean for a couple of days.  It is not, however, gentle on dry ends -- it makes them worse and a lot of conditioner is required to combat how tangled it leaves the hair.  It not so much a bad shampoo, as a bad value, but it would really work best on oily scalp and oily hair.  Smell is on the mild to medium side, and a little bit medicinal, but not unpleasant.",0
"I love CND Shellac but am very disappointed with this item. The color is so much lighter than what is shown in the bottle. it is definitely more pink than red. the finish is streaky and uneven. also, unlike other shellac polishes, this one peels, can dent, and chip. I tried it twice with different numbers of coats and different thickness levels and for the same results. lasted less than a week. totally not worth buying.",0
"This shampoo is giving my hair less dry feeling, but I do not feel like it is getting any thicker. I have been using it for almost 3 months. Expensive and dissappointed that I do not see or feel much of a difference, compared to a regular shampoo.",0
"Stays hot, curls stay in. Love it.",1
I tried this product and for me it dried my  lips and didn't really last for very long. I thought a lip stain should last longer.,0
"This is my 2nd Mason Pearson brush. Yes, I invested in a 2nd one so I do not have to carry my larger one with me when I travel. This smaller one is for my travel bag. I have medium length hair and this is great for travel or for your purse, but I would not recommend it for everyday use.",1
Burns your hair no good,0
"The color is more of a teal green rather than the lighter blue color pictured.
Would not recommend purchasing based on picture alone.",0
"I use the red correcting crayon in this brand and it works fairly well.  This crayon looks like, well crayon, on my light olive complexion.  It may be that it is not for everyone but I wish that there was some guidance as to which skin tones this works with.  It comes across very light against my skin and it is embarrassingly noticeable.",0
Irritating to my sensitive skin.  Causes blotches and itching.  Does not absorb.  Remains on top of my skin.  Therefore it is not hydrating.,0
"This hairdryer has a ton of power which is what I've been looking for. I have long thick hair and hate spending up to 30 minutes drying it in the morning. I've only used this for a few weeks, but it's been really great so far!",1
"I've been using it for two weeks on my Very oily, moderate to severe acne prone skin. My skin feels soft, my husband said it's starting to look better, and I just love how this product feels on my skin. It's very gentle - which is a must for me. I wouldn't call my skin sensitive, but it's definitely reactive to harsh lotions (think benzoyl peroxide).",1
"I thought for the money that I would really like this. I don't. I tried to apply some to my cheeks and barely got any color at all. So I rubbed my fingers on a little longer and applied....still barely any color. I was hoping for more considering I paid $20. Not impressed.
Note to Self: Just cause you pay more, doesn't mean you get a good product. Sometimes the cheaper stuff works better! (I bought a $7 bronzer by Rimmel and I love it) haha",0
VERY pigmented. Applies like a dream!,1
I've been using this for several months now and see no noticeable improvement in my undereye area.,0
"This is a wet crme, not a lubricant.  it's like putting hand lotion on your face, and gunk's up your electric razor. probably better for a blade but not for an electric razor. money totally wasted, I can't use it.",0
Didn't work so well for me.  The nail polish chipped off within 2 days.,0
The iron heats up as advertised. I like the turning ability. I think it is about technique..to get that perfect curl. This one helps you with technique. On complaint it that it is difficult to hold.,1
"I have used this product several times as it works great post-procedure.  I like it so well that I started using it regularly.  I have always bought it at my dermatologists office, but ran out and decided to order online for convenience. What a disappointment! This is a totally fake product it does not smell like the real thing, does not have the same consistency, does not produce the same result, and it is not the same colorthis has a faint bluish tint to it. Ive stopped using it because it is clearly not an authentic product and who knows what I was putting on my skin. I would return it if I didn't just miss the return window. Anyway, buyer beware!",0
I have used this brand due to giving me a natural look and also being a moisturizer and sunblock.  I really liked the fact that it was delivered to my door.,1
"This is a very nice scent. Not flowery , just a pleasant background scent that does not over power you. This is not smoky like the candles by this brand in tin . Stick to the glass containers, much better. Very pleased with this product.",1
I love the finish on the foundation.  I would have given it a 5 star but it has too many chemicals in it; I will I could find something like this that is organic.,1
"I am so glad that I was able to find the Agadir Argan Oil Spray treatment online because I use to get it from my hairstylist before I moved and I couldn't find it anywhere so I checked online and I found it.  So happy.
Thank you.",1
Great product!,1
"Even using spray and everything and it doesn't get as hot as it should be, I tried two times and I'm gonna give it another chance but I'm very disappointed.",0
Works great!,1
"I loved the product that they just discontinued ( davines N 1).
I was so unhappy to find this out.
I phoned and they recommended this product.
I do not love it.
I have changed to a new product all together.",0
"Have used this for years, but not as a primer.  Put it on any small lines after I've finished my makeup application.  Fills in creases.  Great product.",1
"A little thin and watery compared to other sun block products I've used, but recommended by my dermatologist so I'm giving it a try.  Zinc oxide is fundamental for an effective sun block and this product has a sufficient amount of it.",1
"Works pretty much as advertised - spray on, rub in and in a few minutes, you have softer, more supple skin without an oily or greasy feel. Only thing is that I'm not crazy about the fragrance...although not unpleasant or overpowering, it is stronger than I like - the good news is that it dissipates reasonably quickly.

Otherwise, this is a great product from L'Occitane that's worth a try if you don't mind the somewhat strong fragrance when you first put it on.",1
"Is a very good product. Love it. Needs to wash your face , no need moisturizer apply foundation",1
Never worked/turned on. Do not buy.,0
"Unfortunately, I absolutely question the authenticity of this item... I've used this product many times, however this is the first time purchasing online. The consistency is completely different & the results are not even close to satisfactory. As for the consistency, it's really wet & sticky & just feels greasy once on my hair = totally different from the consistency & results of the other bottles of this I've used. Upset that my money has been wasted.",0
"Works very well on my hair. One thing that stinks, though, is that the concentrator piece on the end of the hairdryer comes off every now and then and it can become very annoying.",1
"Could have been good but several of my perfume samples (2) were empty and one other item was expired. Also, received a used nail polish! totally a rip off if you don't use the credit.",0
"I wear Pink Sugar and really like the scent.  The hair perfume had a nice scent (reason for two stars), but it made my hair oily, when I would use it.  And, for those wondering, I didn't use that much of the product while spraying on my hair and my hair is naturally thick and curly.",0
"I love this brush. I have very thick, long hair. It is ALWAYS tangled, wet or dry. Before this brush, I just could not keep up with it. Combing my hair was always a painful and time consuming ordeal. With this brush however, my hair is painlessly untangled very quickly. I was hesitant about combing out my wet hair, thinking that like everything else I've tried, it wouldn't work. But it did. Amazingly. What used to take 15 minutes (and a bucket of tears sometimes), now takes less than two and is a downright PLEASURE. I brush my hair twice a day, every day now and I've noticed an improvement in the look and feel of my hair. I was really hurting with the cost, but when you have hair like this, it is practically a necessity. I would've paid that much just to use it once, that's how pleasant it was. My usually cost conscious mother, after watching my brush my hair said, ""Where was this 20 years ago when I was having to fight to get a comb through your hair?"" and made no comment about the cost. No more tears, no more yanking hair out of my head just to get through a nasty knot. My hair is healthier because I no longer have to fight it, and I am so much happier.

3 MONTH UPDATE: I still LOVE this brush. I had gotten my hair cut right after getting this brush and it has kept my hair healthy and soft and has really stretched the effects of a new hair cut.

8 MONTH UPDATE: Still in love. Still use it every day. I carry it in my purse even! It's really durable too- I literally toss it in my purse without any protection and the only thing I've noticed is that the gold label is starting to wear off slowly. I've noticed that it traps lint in between the bristles sometimes, but nothing that can't be solved by running the included cleaning brush through it a couple times. It's still as amazing and wonderful as the day I bought it! I never review items, much less update my reviews, but $160 is A LOT to spend on a plastic hairbrush so I want everyone to know it is worth it.",1
This applies so smoothly and lasted well.  The dark side works well as an eyeliner but the gold is not showing up so good.  Maybe I'm just not using enough but I tend to error on the side of caution.  Will continue to use and enjoy.,1
"I tried this after falling in love with their green apple hand lotion, and figured that this would be perfect since I prefer BB creams over traditional makeup. This, however, was a huge disappointment.

First of all, the other negative reviews do not exaggerate the unpleasantness of the smell-- it smells like grass. And not fresh grass clippings either-- it's hard to describe, but it's just unpleasant (and this coming from someone who normally loves herb-y fragrances-- this is not that).

Secondly, this offers practically zero coverage. No masking of imperfections, no reducing redness, nothing. If anything it makes my skin look more uneven.

Finally, this cream is just unpleasant to use-- it's REALLY heavy. Not in the ""thick and creamy"" sense-- it's just very dense and hard to apply evenly.

Overall, for the price, this product is just awful. SO disappointed.",0
"I was so happy when I opened this palette, the colors seem to be just what I wanted. However, once on they transform. All these colors turn pink or orange-y when applied on my fair to my pale skin. The highlight color is very yellow and chalky looking on. I get fallout when applying these lightly, and they crease like crazy without primer. In order to use them, I will have to experiment with colored eye primers, I guess.",0
Dried my hair out and killed my curls. Went back to my drugstore brand- way cheaper and much better results.,0
"I had been dying to try this, Amazon had the best price and I used the prime day code to get a big discount and I am so Glad I did! my new go to highlighter and it's not super dramatic to where you can't use it everyday. I have oily skin so I won't be using it every day but I love it.",1
Came broken :(,0
"Glorified Vaseline. Obvious from ingredients, but they are not hiding it. Active ingredient, ""Petrolatum 56.8%"".  Vaseline is 100% petroleum jelly (also known as petrolatum).  I guess I thought there would be more to it. So a bit pricey but accurate product.",1
"Its a nice product for the price, I might just make my own rosewater though.
It smells lovely, not too strong, leaves my face soft.",1
"Not as pictured - Certified Organic stamp is not on the tube. Makes me curious if this is new packaging or a fake product like others are questioning. Smell is interesting and a little strong, coverage is pretty sheer/minimal, and slightly shiny. For sure need to cover with foundation or powder unless you're just going to the beach. It also burned. My eyes when I rubbed them a bit, probably from the fragrances",0
"The product is well done and convinient for travelling but if you have thin long hair don't think you can make a Victoria's Secret fashion show look in 10 min.
You need some time to practice and find your way with this hot rollers. They won't fall down if you put the clip in the right place. They may burn your head a little bit so use the paper napkins if you feel the rollers got too hot. You can make some really great hairstyles and look like you've just step out from a fancy salon but it will take 1-2 hours. My tip for big bouncy curls for those who have long thin straight hair is to put the hot rollers on and let them fully cool down (40-60 min) then carefully take them of keeping the curl around your finger and fix the curl with a metal clip. Do it with all curls around your head, spray on, wait a few minutes and take the clips off. Then style with your fingers.
This way you gonna create a natural chic look.
Without using metal clips as a second stage of hair-do I can't achieve real curls with these hot rollers.",1
Doesnt wear all day at all! Totally gone by lunch. Also leaves a crease in the upper eye area within 30 minutes of application that has to be cleaned up after youve left the house,0
"The spray mechanism is not nearly as good as the Murad product.

I have to hold my breath when I use it, because the alcohol is so overwhelming. I tossed this after a few uses, and bought the Murad one again. This may be cheaper and have a higher salicylic acid content than Murad, but not being able to use it regularly negates its effectiveness, in my opinion.",0
I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS PRODUCT FOR A WHILE AND HURRAY !!! I FOUND IT.  SMELLS GOOD AND DOES THE JOB,1
Beware of this supplier. I was disgusted to receive used product. Both ends of product box were open and safety seal broken.,0
I think this is counterfeit because I buy this brand all the time and the original  label Stila label is smaller and the handle of the gloss is black not gold and this lip gloss stain doesn't last like the other ones I've purchase from Sephora or Ulta I'm feeling very suspicious that this is a fake,0
"I love this perfume...it's very reasonable,fast shipping.",1
Excellent product,1
It doesnt get all the make up off,0
"I love the brightening results of this cream, and really enjoy Obagi products in general. However, I feel this cream is too moisturizing for my oily, slightly acne prone skin. If I avoid certain areas where I'm prone to break out, I find it works well. But the problem is, some of the areas on my face (chin and cheeks) where I am prone to breakouts are also areas where I'd benefit from the brightening effects. So, if you are someone with normal to dry skin, this could be perfect for you. I usually temper this blender with benzoyl peroxide in my problem areas, and obviously a retinol (which the Obagi Nuderm system is designed to be used with anyway). I use a low strength retinoid, so if I bumped up the strength, I'd probably prefer the amount of moisture this Blend Fx delivers. All around, this is a great product and actually works at brightening the skin without hydroquinone. It will not work as quickly or dramatically as the blender with hydroquinone, but I was surprised how effective it is without that typically critical ingredient.",1
no colour!  the description sort of makes it sound as if there is a faint tint.  none at all that i can tell,0
"I have had several of this exact same hot air brush and they have lasted for several months.  (I use it every day)  This particular brush only lasted a week and totally stopped working.  I, unfortunately, put it back in the box and never did try to send it back.  I went to a local store and bought a new one that is working just fine.  None of these last forever, but should last longer than a week.",0
"I have a small spider-vein about the size of a quarter right above my knee. I'm fair/medium but I self-tan in the summer. I thought the bronze shade would work with my faux tan, but it's way too dark. I recommend possibly trying a sample from Dermablend (if you can) before ordering if you don't know your shade. It's easy to apply and blend into the surrounding area and stays on almost all day, even when it's 90F and I'm sweating. It is somewhat drying, though, so I recommend moisturizing your skin before application--that may interfere with how long this stays on.",1
Burned my eyes and made them really red. I've only been using it now for my eyebrows- and I have yet to see a real noticeable difference... but that may require more than a months time.,0
This curling iron is amazing.  I have very fine hair and it not only holds it nicely while curling but the various heat settings are great.  I like that the cord does not tangle.,1
ok,1
"Less than impressed. The application side doesn't come clean very well and the ""blending"" side seems to make cream foundation streaky rather than smoothing anything out.",0
Didn't notice that this product contains methylparaben. I assumed any high quality skincare product wouldn't & didn't check before purchasing. That's my bad but it'd be so great if they could remove the parabens because I would like this product otherwise. Parabens are too sketchy for me to be okay with using on my face though...,0
"It didn't take off my waterproof mascara, and I noticed after a few minutes my eyes were so dry to the point of burning. It was the weirdest sensation. It did take off my face makeup and was fairly gentle. I think the Garnier one is just as good and requires less rubbing to get the makeup off.",0
"I love the slight rose scent to this product and the hydration it gives my skin when
I spray it on before my moisturizer.",1
I wasn't super happy with this product and I wouldn't buy it again. It doesn't really do much of anything to your hair other than add shine. It doesn't even give it any kind of control in the least or even really control any frizz. There are much better products out there.,0
"I purchased a sample size through the Amazon prime sample program.  I am so glad I only paid for a sample and not a full sized bottle.  The product was very watery and had a strong alcohol smell.  The ""tingling"" sensation for me was a burning.  The kind of burning that makes one worry if their skin is coming off.  Run for the ice cubes type of burning.  After attempting to wash off the "" serum"" twice I had bright red splotches on my face where my finger tips(with the serum) has touched.  I cannot recommend this product to anyone!!",0
"I have thick hair and this did not make a single curl hold. I think the 1 1/2"" barrel is just too big for those of us who have thick, longer hair.",0
Really powerful! I wish it had a comb as an attachment.,1
"terrific, takes off everything with no residue",1
didnt work for me. i tried it several times and saw no change.,0
wasnt as powerfull as flash n go that i own.,0
"I am finding this does not protect my nails and chips in one day. The pink might as well be clear, there is no color that it adds to the nail. I would not purchased again.",0
Too much hype!,0
Did no try to use product till yesterday & found that it was totally empty!  Hope if I order again that container has product in it,0
"Fast shipment. Product heats up fast. I have hard to curl hair, so my curls didn't stay in as long as I hoped. But regardless it did keep the curl well in the beginning of the evening.",1
The button of the voltage dose not function! I can't use in oversees!!!,0
been using this product and finally ordered it online...love it!,1
"tldr: I Love these liners.

There is not a dud in this set.

All of the colors are vibrant and smugde proof. Once they dry (about 1 minute after application) they DO NOT MOVE. I had to scrub the swatches with soap and water to remove them. One thing of note, the gold and silver are very glittery, so much so that there is a bit of glitter fallout from them. I have fairly sensitive eyes and had no irritation from any of the colors.

They are of a substantial weight, the consistency is crayon like, twist up and a tiny sharpener pulls out of the bottom of the tube. There is a little over an inch of product in the pencil and sharpening has very minimal waste.",1
"I love this eyeliner! It works well and is a decent price, but there are other products that I found work more effectively at the same prices or cheaper. Only thing is I can buy Stila off Amazon and not pay shipping. (I would recommend Kat Von D or Ciate London)",1
The color doesn't look good on my hands.  I decided to try something different.  Nothing wrong with the product- just not the color for me.,1
good,0
Purple coating began flaking off within a couple of months.  No automatic shut off.  Forgot to turn mine off and it completely melted down at the top of the handle so that the on/off switch would no longer work.  Not a very safe product.,0
"I thought I was buying a real Paul Mitchell product. Based on the reviews I thought it was legitimate seller but what I received is a silver bottle with a Paul Mitchell sticker wrapped around. I have an original bottle and it does not have a sticker wrapped around it. The scent is completely different, who knows what chemicals are in it but this is not a 'New' never opened proudest that was sent to me. It has been tampered with and is counterfeit. BUYER BEWARE!",0
"A year or two ago, I had a sample and love it. I finally got around to buying it and this smells awful! Don't know if my preferences changed or like some other reviewers have said, "" this is not a 'real' Black Kenneth Cole perfume"" or one of it's components/ingredients is stronger than it should be. Unfortunately, i'm giving this away or throwing it in trash.

Some of you may like the smell, but there's something that's too strong. The perfume is on the flowery side with an oak/musky base...sorry not good at describing. I really feel that this isn't the same as a sample I had before.",0
"I didn't get mine from Amazon, but bought it based on the many good reviews here. I had high hopes for this stuff but disliked it immediately. I applied a very small amount (which isn't always easy to do since there is no pump) and it made my hair feel like there was product in it. I could tell right away that it would start building up. It didn't do a thing for styling either.

I have tried it a few times to give it a chance and because of the high price and money wasted and each time I dislike it even more. It does absolutely nothing to help in humidity and it makes my hair feel horrible. Giving it away - maybe, it's my hair type - I hope someone else can use it since I paid so much. :(",0
I can't say how well the shampoo/conditioner works because the sample I purchased arrived empty.  The package was sealed but there was nothing in it.,0
"I like it better than my other cheaper mascara. It makes a good fine coat that doesn't feel heavy on my eyes. Other mascaras would make my eyes uncomfortable (I wear contacts), and this one barely does.",1
Great service Great product,1
My first time using a slant razor and I'm sold. No cuts or irritation. Just go easy and let the blade do the work. No pressure needed.,1
I waited over a year to buy this item because it is so expensive.  It was worth the wait. Would buy it again.,1
"too much of chemical ingredients, it hurts my skin",0
This is the best curling iron I've ever purchased and the long-barrel makes ALL the difference in the world when styling long hair. Worth every penny.,1
"I know that what I received doesn't smell at all like it should. Unfortunately what I'm smelling is a mixture of cheap lotion and some kind of other lotion. I love ck products and I never have smelled anything like this before from ck.  I have used the ck one perfume  and this doesn't come even close to it as far as smell. I just went through this with Victorias Secret lotion that wasn't cheap and what I got was something else in their bottle. I'm not one that is ""write a bad review happy"", but I don't think it's right to rip people off.",0
"Oribe Cote d'Azure Luminous Hair and Body is great product, as with all Oribe products. This product does what it says:
-  Luxurious feel and absorbs quickly without weighing the hair down
-  Made with quality ingredients and smells good
-  Smooths my color treated hair while imparting luster and shine",1
"First let's look at the Trinity device itself and then we'll get into the Eye and Lip Enhancer Attachment. The NuFACE Trinity makes a big promise: Use and you will see your skin plump and firm to reduce the signs of aging. Does it work? YES. Is it the easiest or most convenient product ever invented? NO. Read on.

Process: After washing your face, you will apply the gel primer to the areas you want to target. Because the gel dries very fast I break up my face into three treatment areas: forehead/brows, left side of face, right side of face. Following the 'beep' of the device, you glide the NuFACE over the area three times. There are many techniques you can use to do this. For example, your cheek/side of face is divided into three sections: along the jaw, in the hollows of your cheeks, and on your cheek bone. You glide over EACH area three times, slowly, in tune to the beep of the device. You can also use a hold technique where you leave the device in one place for the beep cycle. This is particularly effective on your nasolabial folds and for picking up your eyebrows. When you are finished you will wash the gel primer off with a warm wash-cloth. You can then apply moisturizer and either makeup (if using in AM) or night creams (if using in PM).

Results: You will see results instantly. I notice them most in my smile lines and in my brows/the 'elevens' between my eyes. Let me explain. The effect is two-fold. The lines are plumped so you no longer see the smile lines or the 'elevens'. There is also a slight paralysis effect in that you can smile and the lines don't come back. Very neat. I hate my down-turned brows. I have taught myself to constantly hold them up using my forehead muscles. The NuFACE creates the same result I get when holding my brows up. My brows easily stay up about a centimeter from where they would be in resting position. This makes me look more awake and less grumpy- definitely a plus!

Drawbacks:
-The biggest drawback is that the results are temporary. After about 6 hours your face is back to normal. Therefore if you want the results, you'll need to use everyday day and night which brings me to the second drawback...
-Time is a big issue. For a full treatment with optimal results, you need about 20-30 minutes. I find if I do a ""quickie"" the results aren't near as noticeable and fade quickly. If you have the time to spend an hour a day on your face, you'll have no issues. For those of us who need every minute of every day for work/life... it gets old even though the results are great. It's still a great investment for those nights out when you want to look fabulous. I actually first heard about the product in an ELLE magazine article about stylists and makeup artists who used it to prep celebrities before an award show so they would look younger and refreshed.
-I hate how the gel primer feels. It's similar to smearing your face with syrup or jelly. I just do not like the sensation. Then it is thick so you have to work it off with the washcloth.

ELE (Eye and Lip Enhancer) Attachment: I should state that I do not have smoker's lines on my lips and I do not yet have crow's feet. Perhaps if I had these types of lines I would have gotten more out of the ELE. That said, I do have awful tear trough lines and smile lines. I honestly did not notice a big difference when using the ELE attachment to target these areas and using the regular NuFACE. I experienced the same amount of lift and plump without having to switch out the device heads. Some of the YouTube tutorials I watched recommended using the ELE to really target your brows and I have to say I get much better lift using the original device on my brows than the ELE! Based on my experience, you really don't NEED the ELE unless perhaps you have smoker's lines or crow's feet.",1
Great quality!,1
Used this product twice and don't see any color. If I don't see any color tomorrow I am sending it back.,0
"This is NOT hypoallergenic. My baby has a milk protein allergy and this lotion (and the soap) contains hydrolyzed caesin (milk protein). My baby broke out in hives and a rash after using this. Not to mention, it also contains almond oil. How can you label something hypoallergic if it contains two or the top eight allergens? Extremely disappointed!",0
"Good price but fragrance is very weak, and does not smell the same as I got from younkers VERY disappointed in it -Paul Loitz",0
"great Butter polish, the color is just too green for me. But that is the risk of buying on line.",0
"I do my own nails, I have for years, so naturally I could open a mini salon in my house with the amount of nail polish I own. I wanted to do a gel for vacation but couldn't bring myself to spend all that money at a salon (especially since I never think they do a better job than me and I have hundreds of colors here.) After 2 days of researching, I settled on this topcoat. My two requirements were it had to last and it had to work with regular polish. I'm putting it to the test. It's been one day, I will update in a week with new results

Base coat: Nailtiques (formula 2)
Polish: Essie pret-a-surfer
Topcoat: Vinylux

The Essie applies beautifully with one coat however while applying the topcoat, the polish became streaky so a second coat was added and the topcoat went on without a hitch thereafter. It took a while to dry completely (over an hour) and even then I didn't know if it would last through the night because it still felt a little off. My first time using this product so I didn't know if that was normal or not, but I woke up without any blanket creases and it feels like a regular polish now. My nails overall feel very strong as if I had wraps on. I have high hopes right now, but lets see if it can withstand the mom of two preschoolers life I live.

*****Update: it's been 48 hours; a trip to the mall, a trip to the grocery store, 8 loads of laundry, 3 sinks full of dishes, broke down about about a dozen boxes for the recycling, half a dozen showers (twins included) and general household cleaning/cooking and at the end of the weekend 1 nail chipped within 24 hours and 2 after 48....the rest are dulled with scratches. I'll still use it only because it's here. Maybe I'll pair it with the vinylux color polish and see how that goes in the future, but all hope is gone. My regular mani's have lasted longer.",0
Don't care at all for this product.  I've tried using them over and over and they just don't seem to roll my hair into those nice curls that you see the celebrities have.  They are easy to use though but they don't give me the same curl as the shorter-type rollers.  I'm very disappointed because I really wanted to like these.  I guess I'll be giving them away.,0
This was my first time trying Butter London nail polish and I did like it.  The color was nice but I am not sure I would purchase again at the price.,1
Love this toothbrush!  I didn't think I'd like an electric toothbrush but this one is fantastic! Highly recommend it,1
Came exploded in the package,0
I love this brand but this product doesnt qork with my skin. So sad. I tried it three times and everytime vroke out really badly after each use. Made my skin soft though.,0
"Sent back- was really not a quality set. I have curly hair and wanted waves sometimes so I thought this would work. It did not. It made my hair straighter somehow. Bad quality, rollers never got very hot at all. DO NOT RECOMMEND. I sent this back immediately and Im a huge Amazon shopper and have only sent one other item back before",0
Nothing compares to opi original nail envy,1
Did not work for me...,0
"I always thought more expensive meant better quality. It doesn't. The minute I put the blue colored substance on my hand it dried out my hand. The consistency is watery and gel like. I have curly hair that is about six inches above my hips. Needles to say, I use a lot of products to keep my hair hydrated. So after my argon oil deep conditioner, my hair was feeling silky. One I put this -product- in all the moisture was sucked out of my hair. When it dried, my family asked if a lion escaped from the zoo. If you have very fine hair that requires lots of moisture then I would stay away!",0
"Not good, very sticky I will not recommend.",0
The best.,1
I didn't find this any better than other lotions I have bought.  I was disappointed after reading all the positive reviews.,0
"You'd think I'd learn by now not to try a new perfume/cologne without actually SMELLING it first (and end up throwing away my money), but I've done it again.  This fragrance has a sharp chemical odor, and according to my husband, it also smells cheap.  Maybe this bottle is from a bad batch - maybe it's not even authentic.  Whatever the case, no more relying on customer reviews and ordering new fragrances online.",0
"This is exactly what I was looking for in a summer-weight eye shadow.  It is so easy to apply, stays on all day AND travels well.",1
Seems unfair to raise the price by $20 right before christmas.,0
Seemed to be very faint smelling when worn. Maybe its old? Idk but not the quality of the ones Ive bought at Macys,0
My boyfriend really loves it. It smells really fresh and clean but also not powering. It's unique smell is really nice.,1
Great product.  This moisturizer with the SPF works great all day long.,1
"I LOVE Lorac cosmetics and this is a great set!  The pencil liner is probably the best pencil liner I've tried.  It actually stays in place and doesn't give me raccoon eyes by the end of the day.  The blush and shadows are fabulous as is the mascara.  The only item I didn't care for was the lipstick. The color was a beautiful nude shade, but it seems very thick and sticky.",1
Made me breakout.,0
This is the same formula/brand that my daughter's dermatologist has private labelled and marked up 200% AND now I can avoid the hassle of an office visit just to get a refill.,1
"I've used Benefit's wax/powder combo before but like this one better. I'm thinking I'll order the blonde next time- my hair is light brown so I was in between and the darker of the two colors seems too dark, but though the lighter looks very brown, for some reason it goes on me a little red- not sure how or why.  My application is better if I put on the wax first and then cover with powder than the other way around.",1
"As I mentioned in my last review, I have a serious issue with dry skin during the winter.

I didn't realize the moisturizer in this set was the same as the single one I had ordered as well. Ah. Well. I guess I'm just set on facial moisturizers for life. Or maybe I can gift the other one!

Again, I didn't realize this set was geared towards men but it's okay!

The face wash is nice. Using female products sometimes is a hassle since you don't know what things will smell like (like my Simple exfoliate --- smells like really strong hair dye) or how your skin will react to the product. I like how the face wash didn't dry out my skin nor did it have any strange strong smell. Also this bottle will last me a good amount of time!

The toner I don't use too often since I'm not exactly sure what it's for and because my skin gets really dry I'm scared that it will dry it out even more or you know... sting since I'm not sure if my skin has cracked or not. But I do love the scent of this! Again, the bottle is a good amount so it'll last you awhile.

I've already reviewed the moisturizer on it's own individual page.

Overall I'm pretty happy with this set!",1
Have been using this product for several years. It gives the right amount of hold without feeling stiff. I have shorter hair.,1
The curling iron was dirty and had oily finger prints on it.,0
"This love this product.  I use it every night.  I am in my early 60's, live in a dry climate, and have used it about 10 years.  Great for my skin and keeping it looking moist and fresh.",1
My daughter originally got the Pherfectionist Amika Shampoo in a BirchBox and loved it so we thought we'd see if Amazon.com had a larger bottle at a better price and what do you know? As if there's something that Amazon.com doesn't sell and at a great price!,1
Love it!!,1
Made my hair feel like Id hairsprayed it. :/,0
"Shipping and price were fine, I just didn't care for the fragrance as I expected to.  When I tried a tester in Santa Fe I fell in love with it, but now it doesn't seem as good.",0
"It's a nice gentle cleanser that lathers really well even with just a small drop. I use this before bedtime and in the morning. It works well, but it doesn't give me a refreshed washed face feeling however. Perhaps my sense of scent is a bit strong, because I didn't like the smell of this cleanser. As long as I try not to breath through my nose, the cleanser is fine after rinse. Thankfully the scent doesn't linger on my skin.",1
Great product!!,1
"Love, love, love this color! My favorite!",1
I like the product. Make sure you follow the directions! It can come down on the price though. It's a little too expensive for such a small container.,1
"This is by far the best shampoo I have ever tried.  I have tried lots but this one is the only one that actually seems to hydrate (not strip and dry) my hair.  Not only does it hydtrate but it also leaves my hair feeling light, healthy, and cleansed.  It's easy on my highlights too.  I was 1st introduced to this line at a Sephora.  I was told there are a few celebrity's whom use this line.  I gave it a try and now wish I had known about this stuff sooner!  Amazing stuff!",1
I like the color based off of what spilled out of the broken bottle in the box.,0
"I generally like Ahava products. I really like Aloe Vera Body Lotion by Ahava. Unfortunately, the peel worked very bad on my skin. After about one week, I had painful, red pimples on my forehead and under my chin. I gave it 1 star because there is no option of not giving a rating at all. I ordered this peel because of good ratings; however, I had to return it. A negative rating does not mean the product is bad. It merely means that the products did not do good to the person giving the rating.",0
Love the smell!!,1
"it didn't fit even though i have the exact babyliss pro nano titanium blow dryer.  It doesnt fit, the attachment is too big",0
I usually love Sabon products and bought them all the time from their boutique in NYC.  Now I moved out on LI and for Christmas my boyfriend ordered this from Amazon because I love it.  When it arrived it had leaked all over the other presents in the package. Very disappointed.,0
Sucks,0
"My dad really like Obsession for men so I got this for him for Christmas.  My dad wears it everyday, plus my mom ask me to get this for him.",1
"My foreo came to me with 0 charge. Major disappointment considering I live in the Bahamas and will have to wait a week for a new one. Major disappointment, debating ordering a new.",0
"bought for couple times, always my first choice make up remover",1
"It works ok, but it's not a full bottle and seems to leak a bit. I called Amazon and they sent another bottle, but I would buy another brand next time simply because this bottle either leaks or evaporates, always looks like more is missing than I've used. The bottles are small.",1
"The battery stopped charging and now it is useless, one day after the return window closed!!!  I am furious!!",0
"Beautiful color, doesn't show much over darker colors.",1
Something that actually works.  love it.,1
"Great product.  It really refreshes your face and improves your skin texture.  A little pricy, though, because it goes fast.",1
"i was a little hesitant to purchase this, as ive read some of the recent reviews about the formula being changed and an awful chemical smell.  either they reverted to the old formula or i got a bottle of older manufacture because this smells great.  i get neck rash if i look in the mirror too hard after i shave and this product does a great job of treating my skin and preventing the burn.  does not leave your face clammy or greasy, but simply moisturized and cool.",1
"who thinks this is a silly product?  I ordered this through vine, because for one thing  it didn't cost me anything and yes, I was curious enough.  But honestly, I didn't feel (or look) any more radiant, toned or hydrated. The only things I felt were silly for spritzing my face and neck with this slightly sticky feeling, citrus smelling water and grateful that I didn't spend any money on it.

Would I recommend?  NO.",0
"While I do not totally love the smell (smells mediciney to me), it does make my hair feel fuller and my thinning spots are not nearly as noticeable!  I don't notice a grand new growth of hair, I think it just plumps up the follicles and makes it less noticeable by far!
Some other reviews said the foam made their hair feel dirty or sticky.  I did not notice this. It's just like a mousse, I just put it on my roots and it totally helps achieve that fuller look too.",1
Expensive for a smaller bottle than competition. Doesn't really work any better than the cheap brands.,0
I used to use this protect and I love it ! But this time I bought this on amazon . And after I used I got red and burning on my face and for irritated spot ! And all of my face !,0
Caused a rash on my daughters sensitive skin. Oh well.,0
I bought my Handheld NuBrilliance thru a shopping Chanel. I love mine & have been very happy with it however I can not find replacement tips that fit mine. Mine is probably 2 years old. I think they may have made some changes to the newer ones so the tips are also compatible with the larger NuBrilliance system. I've asked when I call the toll free number to reorder tips if they knew if they had made any changes to any of the handheld devices & they had no idea. My tips I ordered from Amazon were a very good price but were slightly too big. Did not fit at all. The NuBrilliance customer service rep told me they do not have tips for my handheld device & have not for some time but keep checking back!,1
This is a great moisturizer for winter months.  I have combination skin that tends to dry out in the winter.  This adds delicious moisture without clogging my pores.,1
This is by far my favorite pomade to use. I use this for my hair and my handle bar mustache. Keeps the hair in place with a nice not to bright shine. The mustache will stay in play under tough windy conditions. The smell is amazing. Sweet tobacco is just great. My wife loves it.,1
"I really like this product, the drying time was great I highly recommend this item,",1
"I have always used this , Fantastic love love  love it. I highly recommend it to all with dry hands , it makes them so smoothe  !",0
"I like this product, first time using it and I like the results. I like the way it works...I cant believe I seriously have to keep typing to make my review longer to submit it, smh #annoying",1
Works if you still have some hair. Otherwise you look ridiculous. I used for years while balding to blend with existing hair. Now with more scalp exposed I just shave. Much better really,1
Bought for mom... she swears by it!,1
"I have used Vichy's micellar water before and really like it. It's great for removing makeup, though I will note that I also cleanse with water and cleanser when I use it or I just don't feel clean.

The masks are in TEENY TINY little pots. Like, you might get 4 or 5 full face masks out of each. These are not like the other big brand multi masking kit you've seen ads for - there is only one clay mask and the others are gels.

I used the clay mask on the oily and clogged parts of my face. It worked like other clay masks I have tried, but did seem more gentle. It did decrease the size and severity of the zits I had. I was pleased with it and it has a pleasant smell.

The pink mask, i used on areas that needed to be a little brighter - this is good for dull skin. I wasn't expecting to notice anything when I took it off, but my cheeks really did look less dull. This mask has pumice in it and it advises you to rub it in after masking. I did this VERY GENTLY. I did not want to tear my skin.

The blue mask is for areas that need more moisture. I used this on my forehead and under my eyes. I did not really notice much difference with this one - I feel better using my typical moisture routine (a rich cream covered with aquaphor)",1
"Even though it's called ""summer fragrance"" I plan to wear it year-round.  I hate heavy perfumes, but like to wear some sort of fragrance, so this is perfect.",1
"Normally i use a stiffer styler, but this is nice if you want a softer feel and look. My hair doesn't frizz as much and it smells incredible.",1
I just wasn't impressed with this. It did not make my hair feel any softer or smoother then stuff I could get at the pharmacy.,0
Klorane dry shampoo works very effectively. Nice smell & it rejuvenates the hair--I successfully maintained a blowout for 4 days!,1
I use the CHI Molding Clay and the CHI Matte Wax. Just opened a recent jar of the Molding Clay and it more closely resembles the Matte Wax product. The Molding Clay was a pale pink color and was a very thin cream product. The product I received is pure white and very thick. Does anyone know if they have changed this product or if they had a packaging problem?,0
When I ordered this I did not like ti. I have the flat iron and it worked well but the curling iron did not,0
The formula must have not been the original because this shampoo is not good. It does not lather well. Not worth the money there are better shampoos out there,0
"Expensive, too heavy and I didn't notice any difference in drying time or frizz",0
Helped my fare skid daughter from getting sunburned in Florida in July,1
love the color,1
it left the stain on my nails after removed...,0
"DO NOT BUY FROM BEAUTOGEN.
My original review is below because I do love the authentic product but reordered so I wouldn't run out from a seller called ""Beautogen"" & the serum wasn't as it should be at all-a thick, cloudy, gloppy MESS. Unfortunately since I opened it after the two weeks to use for the first time, I can't get a refund. Extremely disappointed.

Love the scent & feel of this serum. Left my skin looking clear & fresh. Tried to switch to another serum just to experiment & ended up coming back to this one after a week.",0
Came without a lid so not impressed,0
Very nice spring/summer color,1
I love this product!!!  My hairdresser sold this line and love the natural ingredients!!!,0
This gives a good curl.  However the smell is saggy sweet and leaves my hair sticky.,0
My baby can't smell better than this. I have a few others but this is def. the best... smells so good I actually use it myself sometimes :),1
it worked for me.,1
"I have done latisse and loved it, however I did not like how my eyelids turned purple/reddish color. I tried this out bc I heard it had less of the side effects. It did the same thing to my eyelids after two weeks of use :( I am disappointed and discontinuing use. So sad",0
It is almost nonexistent color-wise. You cannot see it on the lips. I was expecting some tint. I still use it as a moisturizer.,0
Like others have posted this one had a bad switch which is a electrical hazard and possible fire hazard. Unfortunately went on vacation so by the time we got back it was too late to return it.,0
"It does not work, period.",0
"This works amazingly well on reducing and clearing hormonal cystic acne (80% reduced by he next morning, 100% GONE within three days), but in my experience it is most effective when used several times throughout the day. However, it should not be used on an open/picked blemish, as it contains alcohol, which can sting, and it's white, so it can dry into an open area, leaving white that can't be washed off.

It is ideal for using on cysts when you FIRST feel one coming on. It's challenging to use, because it's so liquidy, so I've found that holding it over the blemish area and letting a few drops fall, works fine. Just use a cotton swab to remove product from surrounding area.

It can be drying, and cause slight peeling of the skin, but I would far rather have a cyst be completely gone within a couple days, and peely skin to deal with for one day, than to suffer with an annoying cyst for far longer.",1
Love the soft feel to my hair.  Plus it smell good,1
Little spends for what you get.,1
"I don't believe this to be Oribe Shampoo for Beautiful Color based on past experience with the product.  Faint smell of it, faint results too.  I was first weary of the texture.  I thought maybe it had been improved??  Then after 4-5 uses, I am convinced this is not what it says.  I have used Orive for at least a year and this is not it.",0
Good product but too expensive at $19 for a small bottle,1
"item got my 3c coarse hair curly but it had brown flakes when it dried, i tried using less but the flakes were still there, will not repurchase",0
"I've tried the ""Calvin Klein ETERNITY for Men Eau de Toilette"" and so far the product seems to be okay.  The scent is a mixture of several blends and does appear to be somewhat ""woodsy"" which is okay with me.  My wife seems to like it okay and gives it around an ""8"" out of 10.

Would be good to use whether as an everyday cologne at work (don't apply too much) , going out on a special occasion, or at night.  So far, seems to be okay.",1
I love the color of this! Two coats and it's a beautiful dark brown. It lives up to the OPI standards,1
"I liked this razor a lot -- but only for the 8 short months that it held up. This is the type of product I expect to last for many, many years.

The first problem occurred after about 1 month. The handle itself consists of two pieces -- one piece slides into the other at the bottom of the handle, and you twist that to attach and tighten the head of the razor. There is a tiny metal cuff that prevents the inner piece from being completely removed from the outer handle. One day, the entire piece came out, and I was unable to get it back in because of the cuff. I did eventually get it back in, but form that point on, the inner piece also came fully out and removed from the handle itself. This wasn't a huge deal, as the razor was still fully functional.

After 8 months, though, the threads were completely stripped on the piece that screws into the head. I don't know if this was because of the first problem or not, but at this point the razor is completely unusable. I can't find any official way to contact their customer service as a regular consumer, and I've heard it's very difficult to get a response from them if you do email one of the sales people. But I'll try anyway. If they replace it, then great. But I wouldn't buy another one of these. I'll find a better made slant razor from another manufacturer.",0
"As a classical guitar player, I tend to obsess about my right hand nails. They need to be shaped just right, smooth, and solid. Nail Envy was recommended by my dermatologist and so far the results are excellent. Not a nail crack or tear, in spite of the daily workout I submit my nails to. The finish is not 100% matte, there is some shine, but it is acceptable, especially considering the benefits. Of course my use of NE is very specialized - actually, only four nails - and I don't cover it with polish but so far, it's been great.",1
"I bought this product for my upper lip area.  It works very well on the smaller, finer hairs; but, it does not remove the darker, thicker hairs.  I don't have many of those, but it is frustrating to keep applying the strip and pulling and seeing the same stubborn hair or two still in place.

For what you are paying, it works well.  I'd be willing to pay a bit more though so all the hairs come out in one nice pull.",1
"Very VERY sheer. I would have liked a bit more pigment in it, but it's great otherwise.",1
"The product works great, I have been a nail biter my whole life.  So this is something that works and makes my nails grow very fast.
Will order again.",1
The pure finish mineral powder is easy to apply and soft as well as gentle on the skin. The shade was a little darker than i was expecting but other than that i really enjoy the product. I also think the packaging is quite nice and has good quality to it. I would also like to add that the applicator is beautiful and adds a flair to the product as a whole and just makes it more fun to put on.,1
"I've heard so many people raving about this CHI spray so when my Tresemme thermal heat spray ran out, I thought I would upgrade with the CHI. I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this product. My hair feels heavy, has zero shine and is greasy by the end of the day. My cheap drugstore spray gave my hair volume and shine and my blowout would look good for three days before my hair felt greasy. I will not be buying this again. It's going into the guest bathroom and hopefully someone else will get use and good results out of it.",0
It was watered down! It was a waste of my money,0
"The feel was fine, but please note this cream is scented and something in it caused an allergic reaction. To be fair I am prone to allergies, but have never reacted like this to a face cream before. I have used other ahava products and loved them and that's why i tried this. it was not a skin allergy, so i didn't know it was the cream until the 2nd time i used it and had the same reaction.",0
I love the product.  I will order from this merchant again.,1
I look forward to using this pump and placing the foam that comes out to clean my face in the morning.  I find it soft and a relaxing ritual.  It feels clean but could dry out the face a little if you do not have oily or normal to oily skin.  I tried using the cleanser after work to remove make-up and it just does not do the trick..  My BB Cream and eye make-up were superficially removed.  So if I do use it in the evening it is after I use a make-up remover.  I like this product but do not expect it to remove a lot of debri or make-up. The only other issue is while it is gentle when it gets in my eyes they do sting.  So rinse thoroughly. with water.,1
Package was damaged when received; can't tell if product was opened.  Strange smell to product upon application.,0
Product worked fine but there was a huge warning slapped in saying there is a chemical that's used in this that is known to cause cancer... Im not that desperate.,0
I've tried the many products and none compare to the menscience line. Had to let the secret out to friends and family. Strongly recommend.,1
I really like this powder. It seems to have more than one color in the powder that gives it a more natural look. I had never heard of this brand but took a chance. I would definitely purchase it again. It gives a bit of a matte finish which is what I was looking for.,1
"Be careful here, this is NOT the 2.5 fl OZ tube, it is only 1.5 fl oz.",0
Takes a couple passes but it does what it needs to. Tiny size perfect for short hair.,1
"Good concealer. I apply it to the dark circles under my eyes-if you use it for this, be sure to put powder over the concealer to hold it in, otherwise mascara will adhere to it throughout the day and you will have a whole new set of problems! With its thicker consistency, it also fills in my ice-pick scars fairly well.",1
This sunscreen works well and is not shiny or oily. Though I think the La Roche-Posay Anthelios Clear Skin is a better value because it is less expensive and less product is needed for the same coverage. This sunscreen is very thin and takes a good amount to cover a face. I wore this under makeup and it didn't affect my makeup or make my skin oily. I didn't really think the tint made a huge difference though so I would recommend the Clear Skin (untinted) instead.,1
It bleeds,0
Im not a fan of this product. I have fine hair and it seems to weigh it down and I have to wash my hair the next day rather than two days. I do like the texture spray and hair spray though but will not be repurchasing shampoo or conditioner. I wish I could exchange.,0
"Really like this cream.  It's light weight and doesn't have much of a scent to it, but it takes care of the dryness.",1
I love PCA products. I only rate it two stars because the tube that was sent to me was already opened and used.,0
i received what i believe to be a spoiled or old product. returned,0
"The color was way darker than described online, so I returned this. I'm waiting for it to be in stores so I can test shades instead of guessing online  since the descriptions are not helpful/ accurate :(",0

The breakdown on how I determine my star rating of a product
5 stars  I love it! It is awesome and I highly recommend that everyone purchase this product!
4 stars  I like it, but there are some flaws. Not everything can be perfect! I would purchase again.
3 stars  It was okay, but I would probably not buy it again unless I had no other choices.
2 stars  There may be worse products out there, but you can definitely find better choices.
1 star  I dislike the product, I wish I had not purchased it and do not recommend anyone else to purchase it.

"Depending upon how thick a layer you apply, it certainly does create a shimmering effect. As you can see in the ingredient list, there is mica in it to reflect light, very small particles. In the bottle, the emulsion looks white, and indeed, when a small amount is squirted onto the hand prior to application, it also looks a silvery white. This means that it adds a layer of very light pigment along with the reflective aspect. This would make some people look like a ghost but for me it is ideal because I have a ruddy Celtic complexion that I prefer to downplay. So I'm using this without a foundation over it. But I believe it is meant as a base layer under your regular foundation makeup.

The lotion has a delightful smoothness and applies easily. The bottle is heavy glass with a quality pump. There is no fragrance (essential for people like me with perfume allergy to know) or any other smell. So aside from the hyperbole in the product description (really!), this is an excellent product.",1
"so soft, best powder brush. will purchase again",1
"A very nice facial moisturizer but a little on the heavy side. I should have bought the oil free admittedly, but its still a good moisturizer that lasts all day. Cheap moisturizers usually dry out mid day, this doesn't.",1
refreshing and smells great. doesn't leave my face dry. I like it a lot.,1
worth every penny. best topcoat ever.,1
Love love love this stuff honestly can't get enough!!! I will use this product forever! This was my second bottle I bought and I went ahead and bought the bigger size because I use it so much. Part of my daily routine!,1
"Definitely it moistures my curly hair in a nice way without leaving it looking greasy, but it does have a strange EGG SMELL!! I don't feel comfortable walking around with this smell in my hair.
I don't know what's wrong with mine smelling like this, as I read the comments that mentioned no noticeable smell at all.",0
"First of all, I like Shellac and use it a lot. All colors I own look great and last long, except FEDORA. This nail polish started to chip next day! I contacted the seller, but they refused to help me: to exchange the nail polish or refund. Will not work with them again.",0
Makes my skin a little greasy but otherwise I love it.,1
I'm not a fan of the scent...no returns accepted...,0
"This is my go to.  I have tried many other brands and types, but this one is always my favorite.  I just wished they made them in bigger palettes.",1
Did not work on my hair at all. The clip of the wand left an imprint on my hair.,0
"I tried this on a few different people in addition to myself and came to the conclusion that it is not too great on any of us.

IS IT MOISTURIZING?
The title of this is Matte Moisture Tint, that implies to me that it is moisturizing somewhat.  In applying it to a variety of skin types and ages, I did not find it at all moisturizing.  In fact, it applied sort of like a very lightweight paste.  Every person I put it on made some kind of comment about how dry it felt going on- even the one with normal to oily skin.

COVERAGE
The coverage of this tint is okay in that it evens out skin appearance, that is if you are about 10 feet away. Once you get closer, you can see that it sits on top of the skin.  This tint amplifies facial hair, creases, little lines on skin, and really does not look natural at all.  If you feel old or icky some day, you will probably not feel any better after putting this on.

WEAR
As time went on, despite the lack of complimentary appearance when wearing it, this tint seemed to become a combination of silicone-ish and dry patchy feeling on the skin.  I really didn't like it, and neither did anyone I tried it on.

BOTTOM LINE
Some tints or foundations are better on one type of skin than others, or a particular age group, but this didn't seem to work for anyone I put it on, from teen to mature women.  The idea is good, but the product does not seem to deliver moisture or natural looking tint.",0
Scam!  This is NOT the real Grande Lash!  I checked ingredients against my real tube and the first ingredient of this is Deonized Water!  I translate that to be WATERED DOWN!,0
"This product is intended to be used as a treatment, to supplement your existing skin care routine, not as a moisturizer like another reviewer implies.
Hydroquinone is the gold standard for skin lightening ingredients, but many people shy away from using it for a variety of reasons. Revision's 30% Vitamin C Lotion is the next best thing out there and does not have the drawbacks of hydroquinone. Unlike hydroquninone, Revision's Vitamin C lotion is safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, during summer months, for people who are out in the sun a lot, does not require a prescription, and can be used without having to take time off.
The technology Revision uses provides one of the highest concentrations of vitamin C available, and uses a delivery system that maintains the efficacy of the vitamin C for far longer than any other vitamin C product out that. Vitamin C  oxidizes the moment it hits air, rendering it all but useless after a few months, so any jar or serum bottle will deteriorate the vitamin C from the very first time you open it. The airless pump combined with the encapsulation of the vitamin C ensures that your last use is as effective as your first.",1
"Doesn't work at all. I am really upset I wasted so much money on something that does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!! I bought this back in May and have only used it on my under arms. I used as directed with no results. Then I tried once a week with no results. I wanted to do just one area. So I could really find out if it worked before the cartridge ran out. I can say for a fact that I have not experienced 6 weeks hair free. I haven't even experienced a week hair free. I should have returned it and got my money back, but 30 days wasn't enough time to find out if it worked.",0
I love this product. I would not do without it.,1
I returned it because it was the wrong one.,0
"Its very chalky, neon in color, not the smooth light pink I was looking forward to. I would have kept it if it wasn't so neon!!! =(",0
Not sure why I don't like this anymore...did they change the formula was Onesta bought out?  doesn't seem the same.,0
I have this color in berries and it is perfect for wearing under dark wine colors. It's gorgeous and hydrating. The only downside is the price but I will still probably buy it in another color.,1
"I was disappointed. This is a pricey product, and I didn't see any difference after a few months. Maybe it works better for younger people, I am in my mid fifties. I find cheaper moisturizers  work just as well.",0
"Disappointed with the quality of this product. At first it was so soft and gelly I couldn't apply it, now it's so hard I have to scrape it.",0
Very nice texture--goes on without any drag on delicate under-eye skin.  It's too soon to see any reduction in under-eye puffiness.,1
"Go gently with this. My hair is usually very resistant. This fried my hair and it is still incredibly curly. I now have more frizz, not less.",0
"I am an older woman and this eyeliner was just not right for me.  It is too iridescent, I was looking for a more matte look.  Very disappointing. I gave it to my granddaughter who loved it.",0
"One of the better creams I've used... not too thick that it clogs your razor, and leaves skin feeling fresh without having to use any after shave.",1
"I used this for about 6 months. Fairly expensive, for what it is. Cleans adequately, and I feel like it doesnt disrupt moisture balance. Smells like Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage, but you get used to it.",1
"I've been using this product for several years now.  I learned a valuable lesson a while back....buy the real thing.  I bought another brand of the ""same thing""  (according to the salesperson), and withing a few weeks, my hair had an undeniable green tinge to it.  Threw out the generic crap, bought the real thing, a voila!  hair is back to normal color!",1
"The single star if for the packaging- very attractive. Of course, once unwrapped the package does not matter. The soap has zero scent. I was eagerly awaiting the honeysuckle scent that is ""infused in each soap bar until the very end of the bar"". Maybe I have an old bar of soap but I am extremely disappointed. One expects that a 20.00 bar of soap would be as described.",0
"This is an interesting product that requires some experimentation to figure out how to best use. For me, mixing with a little lotion to tone down it's quite-tan color, makes a good cover to give me tan legs when I want to show them. You need to make sure, however, that you allow about 15 minutes for the color to try, or it will smear on your clothing. This is a good alternative to self-tanner, though it washes off with a shower, where self-tanner lasts about two days (in my experience.)

For me, using this product on my skin works best, but others may like it on their faces as well. In any event, it gives you a tan look without exposure to harmful rays.",1
"Super easy mud mask. Applying the mask requires peeling off BOTH sides of the plastic. First I removed the white plastic side and pressed the mud lightly on center line of my face, then I peeled off the clear plastic side which allowed me to press the cloth & mud onto my face. Both sides need to be removed to get good application. There does seem to be a trick to application and I will get better with each application. Smartmud felt cooling the entire time it was on my face and was still wet after the 10 minute wait. I peeled the mud off tossed it into the trash can and only had to gently rinse to get the remaining mud off my face. I plan to use these for girls spa night next month and I am sure it will be a hit.",1
"Great smell and it helps revive my senses. Wish it didn't have a few chemicals such as phenoxyethanol, which is a preservative. If it was all natural, I would definitely give it 5 stars.",1
"Really does work. Great price, cheaper than getting though spa.",1
"I credit my wife for getting me into exfoliating, toning and moisterizing, all my life I felt it was a women's thing. I'm retired military and I noticed that Black Jack products were readily available in the base exchange store, so began picking up some items. I shave my head as well as my face and always have suffered with ingrown hairs and razor bumps. I began using this Black Jack Bump Fix on my problem areas which happen to be spots on both sides of my head about two inches in diameter. May face is always left squeaky clean, feeling refreshed and setup perfectly for nice close shave. I've used this product for a couple of weeks and I'm noticing my problem areas are clearing up.",1
Not seeing results. Have used it religiously for 2 months now....,0
"I have very sensitive and acne-prone skin. I went to a dermatologist who told me she used to sell this to her clients until they stopped letting her but she gives it to her kids. I tried EVERYTHINGGGG over the counter and was totally desperate. I tried this and my skin had to get used to it (and it did very quickly) but I love it. I don't like spending too much so I stopped after it ran out and got the Neutrogena naturals entire set, it just didn't clean the same. Truly, it sucked in comparison. I had to buy another bottle of this and it just came to me, I switched immediately and my skin is back to clearer (sigh of relief). This will just be my only splurge.",1
"Returned this, way to big of a barrel.",0
Works OK.,0
"Feels great putting it on and then the fires of Hell erupt and it burns! Needless to say, not good on a sensitive skin.",0
This product is as advertised but I wish I would have known it was travel sized before purchasing it but it's partly my fault because I should have asked before buying. I will use product but would not repurchase.,0
The eye shadows go on very smoothly and have great color. I'm not use to wearing earth tones so there's a lot to work with. It's easy to build intensity. I'd prefer colors that are a little more complimentary to each other. Great colors to fill in brows with and to line eyes.,1
"My bumps got worse after using this kit for a few days only. Bumps were more noticeable, red and started to appear on the other parts of my body!!!! I would never buy/recommend this product...",0
Did not work at all although I followed the directions exactly. Tried several times but still did not cover.,0
"I am not sure if this product is really from L'Occitane. I used it for a while (2 containers), and now this time I have to see a doctor for severe skin redness and itichness. I will not order it never again.",0
"To start, I've battled with cystic acne on and off since puberty (I'm 25yrs old). After having relatively clear skin for the past several years, starting about 6 months ago I began to experience regular flare ups again. I would get 2-3 painful cysts and when it seemed like those were finally starting to heal up I'd be hit with a couple more in a never-ending cycle. I researched different acne fighting systems and decided to try this one, which I ended up getting from my local dermatologist. I had high hopes for this product. When I initially started using this system I noticed a slight improvement in the condition of my skin. It seemed like the cysts were clearing up a little faster than before but other than that there really wasn't a significant difference in appearance. I still continued to get cysts regularly. About a month ago, I began to exercise again and noticed that I was no longer developing cysts regularly (which makes me think this bout of acne is triggered by crazy hormones/stress). However, I continued to use this product to battle my oily skin. A week ago, I took a break from this product (b/c I was out of class for a few days and figured it didn't matter how oily my skin was) and didn't use anything on my skin other than warm water and occasionally a wash cloth. Low and behold my oily skin is significantly less oily now that I'm no longer using this system. When I was using it, I would wash my face when I woke up in the morning and before bed. It would always bother me that just a few hours after washing my face in the mornings it would be super oily again. But now it makes sense. This is a really harsh system. The medicated cleanser, toner and lotion were stripping the oils from my skin, causing an over production of oil in a big freak out. But my skin has really settled down since I stopped using this product. In short, this product didn't really do much for me other than cause my skin to over produce oil. And although it didn't make my cystic acne worse, it didn't get much better either. This product in my opinion is not worth how much you pay for it.

Now, I do recognize that this does and will work for a lot of people (it's got so many glowing reviews after all). For those that decide to try it, take note that this can cause significant irritation (significant burning of the skin, redness, etc) if you aren't careful. And even if you are careful, you will still experience some burning/tingling as your skin adjusts to the products. Please note, after you use the toner you need to wait for it to dry completely (several minutes is best) before applying the lotion. If you don't wait long enough, you will seriously regret it as your face is going to feel like it's on fire. Also, if your acne is hormonal/stress related as mine was, this probably isn't going to do a whole lot for you unfortunately. I've found exercise and increased water intake to be much more effective for that kind of acne!",0
"It's a great aid if your hair is thin, as well as very fine.
It does give the look and feel of having more.",1
I love this product. Makes my thin hair look thick. I bought the smallest bottle to try it out. I will buy some more,1
"Decent coverage.  Not my favorite product, but it does the job well enough.  I would prefer slightly more coverage.
Nothing really ""special"" for me with this product.",1
"Red Flower, Indian Jasmine smells so delightful. The fragrance alone sweeps you and your stress away.",1
"This wax pomade does a good job with very little little product. Rub into the palms and then distribute evenly through the hair. Comb and style in place. This product will keep everything in place and left my husband's silver hair looking shiny with out being stiff and hard to the touch. It also worked on his mustache as well giving him a nicely groomed appearance. This is a nice but somewhat pricey product, but it does go a long way.",1
"I've been curling my eyelashes every day since the early 80's, so I know what an eyelash curler is supposed to do. I am astounded at just how ineffectual this one is. The garden variety metal curler found at the drug store works much better. Unfortunately I threw my metal curler away when I started using the Avon heated curler because it worked so much better and was much more comfortable to use. Then the Avon curler stopped working entirely after the 3rd battery change in a month. I was looking for something to replace that with when I found this one on Amazon. The reviews seemed so glowing that I was truly shocked when I simply could not tell one bit of difference after using it than before. I have thinning, light brown Caucasian hair.",0
"I bought this lip stick out of a magazine and I LOVE it!! It really does turn pink but its not a harsh pink. The color doesnt last all day but several hours at least. The texture is beautiful. The lipstick is actually pretty small so it doesnt last very long but its well worth the money even if you do have to buy it more often. Im ridiculous about using lip gloss and lip stick so when I find a great one, Im so happy!!",1
This iron does not provide any curl or wave to my hair at all. Simply ends up straight after I use this.,0
"Kenneth Cole must have started producing this perfume again!!! Best day ever. I have been using it sparingly over the past 2-3 years because I thought it would be the last bottle I'd get to buy. I'll start wearing it daily again...light, not overpowering scent. I've gotten lots of compliments. Thank you KC! Thank you Amazon!!",1
Wonderful for travel.  Just slip into your bag for a quick cool down at the beach or on the plane.,1
BROKE AFTER 6 WEEKS>,0
"The first time I put eyeshadow on this brush, the bristles just splayed out all over the place and eyeshadow went all over my face. It doesn't really provide even coverage and it can't be used for blending or anything. Wouldn't buy again.",0
"Don't buy from this seller- item is advertised as a set - I was a bit surprised when I only got a lip scrub. Contacted the seller and they blamed Amazon for the description they posted - refused to honor what they advertised - thankfully Amazon honors even bad sellers faulty descriptions.

The actual product is amazing! Smells heavenly and works great to remove dry skin on lips and moisturizer lips - perfect for all those matte lipsticks we ladies use nonstop",0
the color is fine but it cakes up. you need to use a lot of moisturer first - not smooth enough.,0
"This concealer kit was difficult to apply, and badly packaged. I struggled to get the product neatly from it's pan and when I applied it, the colors didn't work well as concealers. They were kind of goopy and didn't blend well with foundations. As well they had an odd texture, they reminded me of makeup you buy a child. Sorry to say such because I really looked forward to the face products!",0
The product I received in the mail was an oval shaped barrel for zig zag waves. This is not what was advertised or what the pictures were of. The product also looked used and had a sticky substance on it.,0
"Pevonia moisturizers are great, but the peels are not that effective.",0
Smells good and leaves my daughter's hair clean and shiny,1
i don't like powdery scents so I like this one.  It's a strong scent but pleasant. It lasts a good while.  It's an unusal.scent so its hard to describe .what it smells like.,1
can't beat OPI,1
Did not go on smoothly.,0
Did not like it at all,0
nice and cool and smooth!,1
"I have bad allergies and tend to sleep with my mouth open. Thus, I also have extremely bad chapped lips most of the time. I have tried many different products over the years and this is one of the best. It cools your lips with mint and soothes dryness with the shea butter. It leaves a protective film on your lips that is usually still there in the morning.
It is a little greasy, but well worth it to me.",1
I've had a hairdryer like this for about 4 years. I purchased a duplicate so I will have one on had when my current one dies. This is hands down the best hair dryer I've ever owned.,1
My husband loves La Source by Crabtree & Evelyn. He bought this product from Amazon and I don't know if it came from a bad batch or is a counterfeit product but it doesn't have the correct smell and it didn't absorb into the skin immediately as he is accustomed to with this product. Very disappointing and a waste of money. Now we have to go search for it locally as the onsite store at a local mall has closed. Be careful.,0
Pretty color but the Polish is really thick. It went on ok. End result seems nice though.,1
"I realize that it's a mini and may not deserve to be held to the same standard as a full-sized flat iron, but the fact that (at least with the one I received) the plates don't close means that this isn't worth the admittedly inexpensive price, at least for me. I have short hair (i.e. a couple of inches long at most) and assumed that a flat iron with a small plate would serve me better than one that had plates as long as my hair, but it's proving difficult to find one that's a half inch and isn't cheaply built.",0
I like the product but pricey and doesn't seem to last very long,1
"I received one color eyeliner as a gift; I liked the application process and how it stayed on all day, so ought another color which is also great.",1
"I love this hand cream. I've used it for years. I'm finding, though, that it absorbs quickly - maybe it's just my skin getting older (gasp). The smell can't be beat - I love it. I just wish it stayed around longer.",1
"I would give zero stars but that's not an option! I bought this a year ago and it stopped heating up.  Seems to be a common problem.  Company will only stand by warranty if your a stylist.  Gold Fulfillment the distributor I bought it from here on amazon was unhelpful and frankly didn't care. Totally waste of time and money. Do not but this product and do not buy from GOLD FULFILLMENT!

DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.",0
My friend recommended me this product. It works great!! I have really thick hair. It applies really easily and washes off easily. It gives a fairly strong hold and doesn't a shiny fake look. It also smells awesome.,1
My FAVE hairspray!,1
"Great smell, not anything special. Unlike their oil which is the best!!",0
This product is extremely dying and spells like paint.  I am not sure if this is how the product is supposed to be but I am afraid to put it back on my hair after one use.  Will not buy again!,0
I tried a week and did not see the different. And I gave up. It does work as the ad. Not recommend.,0
"Garbage! I honestly don't know if this is grease or, like a high grade industrial glue. When you put it on your hands, you can barely rub them together. It is SO HARD to wash off, like I used my nails to scrap of the ""grease"" of my palms and it was so nasty. Ohhh but wait, there's more. Ohhhh heck yes, just when you thought a product couldn't get worse. When you shower and ""attempt"", let me say that one more time, ""attempt"" to rid your hair of this cancer, it doesn't completely go away. It will leave small, flakes in your hair that NO SHAMPOO OR VICIOUS SCRUBBING WILL REMOVE! Dang, it's almost as persistent as that girl you hooked up with in High School because you thought she had a cute face but realized she was a troll when she didn't shower in foundation, geez go away Holly....",0
Tried to return. Does not accept returns. Paint seemed old or been exposed to heat. Did not paint on well at all. Never will buy again.,0
"I'm in my sixties, and I use Retin-A, so it's extremely important that I protect my face and neck from the sun. I live in the South and I'm an outdoorsy type, so zinc oxide is the only way to go. I found this product recommended on a dermatologist's website, so I tried it. I love it. Just a little bit spreads easily over the face and neck, and you gently rub for about 20 seconds to make it turn from white to clear and soak in.

It is moisturizing and thick enough that I use no other product in the daytime. No moisturizer, no makeup. I love the way it evens out my somewhat blotchy pinkish skin to a more even, whiter, tone. But not matte white -- the zinc oxide soaks in.

I wear it every day, all day. My face is completely un-tanned, just the way I like it. I use another, cheaper, zinc oxide product on my body.",1
very pleased with my purchase,1
Highly suspect- this might be a counterfeit product. It smelled completely different (really strong and bad) than past times I've bought the product from a retail store. The real spray is awesome though (and smells great).,0
"This stuff is disgusting. I like a lot of Paul Mitchell products but this made my hair DISGUSTING like I little kid put something in my hair and no matter what I cant wash it out. I would gift this to someone I hate so they have a bad hair day I hate this product so much. I had something to go to and I tried it and it was the only shampoo and conditioner I had, it made my hair so gross and so greasy and tacky that I had to go to the store and buy cheap shampoo and conditioner because I couldn't go to the event with my hair the way it was after using this product, so I ended up being late because of this stupid shampoo and conditioner that is a horrible cheap gross product.",0
"It's a curling iron so you use it to curl your hair. My hair has issues curling and it was no different with this iron. It's ok though, curls my sisters hair just fine.",1
A well balanced scent characterizes this eau de toilette.,1
"I have only used this product for a short time, but so far I like it, makes my face softer. I have deep wrinkles so that will take longer use I'm sure.",1
"Very thin lather.  Very stiff consistency and hard to ""dab"".  Big disappointment.",0
Opposite sex likes it.,1
"OMG is the best highlighter, love it!!!!!",1
"Aside from it being very moisturizing, I don't think I notice a huge difference in my undereyes.",1
"I have heard only good things about this product and I am glad that you offer it at such a great price.  It is too bad that I apparently have a thief in the neighborhood.  Found the box, empty, on my porch.  Better luck next time.",1
Beautiful and hefty razor.  It is kinda short.,1
This was an opened package and I beleive it was a knock off. I have used presage prior bought from nordstroms and this does not seem the same. No longer using,0
Great gift for the man in your life.,1
"I bought this at TJ Maxx for only $60.  I have used it 4 times and it's broken.  A piece of plastic inside broke.  I called RUSK and they will send me a new machine if I mail them my broken one and pay for shipping there and send $ for return shipping, ugh!  As for the 4x I used it.... the machine is sort of awkward to hold.  You have to hold it just the right way to insert your hair and curl it.  It takes a long time (longer than just a curling iron).  You have to use small sections of hair or it will tangle your hair up in the barrel.  The curls look nice when done, however.  I would suggest just getting a regular curling iron!",0
"At first this color was a little too ""bubble gum"" pink for my taste... but then I added a couple of coats of Opi's Rosy Future and love it!",1
"I read a fantastic ""Love Letter to La Roche-Posay Serozinc"" blog post, and was instantly intrigued. It only has 3 ingredients: water, healing zinc sulphate (0.10%) and astringent sodium chloride (0.75%) -- a perfect combination that is a solution for a variety of skin issues in a convenient spray form! And while it is refreshing and wonderful on your face, the use I was most interested in was for diaper rashes. My toddler has sensitive skin and is prone to getting very red, oily diaper rashes. We've tried a variety of diaper pastes, but none have worked as well as this spray!",1
"I don't care for lip gloss that is that sticky. It also sticks on your teeth.
I would not buy it in the future.",0
Made my skin break out and I don't have sensitive skin at all. Avoid!,0
"I have had this product numerous times. Usually I buy it full price (this is half the price as it normally is) from the spa I go to every month for a facial. This product is so cheap because it's not the original product. The color is slightly off and the smell and texture is off. This leaves me to believe that whoever is selling the product is cutting the product 50/50 with the real thing and the other 50% is some generic white lotion. It doesn't even smell as strong as the original. Beware when you spend half price for beauty products like this. It's half price for a reason. I gave it a go, but will continue to buy it full price from my esth.",0
"The concealer that I received had a very different texture than what I have bought in other stores.  When I squeezed the concealer to apply, it came out sort of lumpy, and then it was just oil.  The product may be old or defective, but I will not reorder again.",0
as advertised,1
"Worst product on the market. It covered me in orange dots. No matter how i shook the can or sprayed it, it was horrid. Threw the rest out.",0
"This dries your skin out! It looks like a lotion when applied. I used to use acne.org's benzoyl peroxide treatment, but it seemed like my skin had gotten used to it and it wasn't helping. The topix is working, but I have to moisturize before applying my concealer.",1
Received the product damage,0
It definitely takes a little bit of getting used to compared to the traditional merkur safety razor. the weight is heavier and feels a but more clunky when you first use it. however after a couple of days you cant really tell the difference. only complaint is the smooth handle. I get a tight grip most of the time unless shave soap/cream gets on it. but you can just rinse it to restore grip. good grip if its only water.,1
Great great product. Our granddaughter plays soccer and is very fair this works great and does not have the bad for you ingredients.,1
Did not work for me. It's a strange product. Don't recommend. I'd rather use a generic neutrogena spot treatment product.,0
We purchased this 2/25/17 and by 5/27/17 it stopped heating up and working.  This was expensive flatiron.  We are very disappointed .,0
"So far I like it. I have been using it for about a week about 3 -4 times and it hasn't dried out my skin but it also hasn't made any improvements.

I went to a ulta for other products and I found this product on the shelf. It looked and smelled exactly the same as the one I purchased from amazon.

Hopefully this works !",1
This brush is large and the bristles are stiff...I'll use it for cleaning crevices in tools.,0
"This smells so awful! I bought it for my husband and literally cannot wait to get it out of my house! I am definitely sending this back...yuck! I thought it would be more ""natural"" not chemical..",0
"after i use it on my hair, it looks amazing, but i have naturally straight and very thick hair, so after about an hour, it goes flat. i use hair spray so it's not that. if you have the same problem, get a ceramic iron , not this one",0
Super quick shipping phenomenal flat iron,1
Stop warming up after couple months. Can't use on short hair like advertised.,0
"So after purchasing a few tubes here by this seller on Amazon, I was running and low and bought one directly from my stylist. I noticed the label was a bit different where under the logo mine said ""strong hold gel"" where as the amazon version sold here has some spanish translations under the logo. Now that is no big deal as long as the products worked the same but that was sadly not the case.
The american version of the product itself smelled better, appeared to be a bit lighter in color and had some faint sparkles in there. It felt lighter going into my hair but had much better grip and control. Also, when blowdrying my hair it actually stayed in place for most of the day vs a few hours with the stuff sold here.
Buyer beware spend the extra few bucks and get it out from a reputable source. I for sure will not be buying some watered down version just to save a few bucks.",0
I haven't noticed any differences.. But I only use it once a day after I wash my face. It does not irritate my skin so that is nice,0
"The price is for 100 ml. It is said you have to use it every other day for few weeks. Well, this bottle is hardly enough to say if it works or not. After using 1 bottle I saw no significant results, so I decided not to spend another 30 bucks just to make sure the thing is not a miracle.",0
"The item works ok but it is completely unacceptable to me that an item would take six weeks to ship. I would never purchase anything from this company again.

I realize the negative is not directed at the item and thus may be construed as unfair. However, I must account for the lack of service experienced by the company with the review. I do like the item and would give it 4 stars or perhaps 5 later if it holds up as advertised. So, in my opinion, find the same or similar item but from a different company. The only way to express such dissatisfaction is via low ratings, so low ratings it is.",0
Never absorbed into my skin. Goes on shiny and sticky and stays shiny and sticky. One of the worst sunscreens Ive ever used. The only true statement in the description is that its unscented.,0
"I read all of the reviews and thought this product sounded great; I have since been through 3 cartridges and the hair did slow but after 2 months, is all back like I'd never had the device.",0
Great product.,1
Great job of holding things in place.,1
ordered this after reading such great reviews... does absolutely nothing for my acne... waste of money. moreover after u apply it.. u move around the house with this stuff on the face...which is kind of uncomfortable.. as personally i would prefer clear lotions.,0
It does not whiten teeth as described on a TV Infomercial.  I will never purchase it again!!,0
Received product today and the tube was not full and the product was very liquid.  Wonder if this is a real version as it was the first time I had purchased.,0
"This was recommended to me by a friend, when I tried it, it dried out my skin so badly I had white, dry flakes. I would not recommend this purchase.",0
"This may be the best self tanner yet. Being fair and freckled, I am constanly putting a tanner on.  I have tried almost ever tanner out there and haven't found one that doesnt smell, isn't sticky, doesn't wash off after showering. I would say the smell of this one is quite pleasant. Use gloves or a mit. A mit seems to work best. Color will last about 3 days without reapplying. Foam gives immediate color but darkens by the hour. I have slept with this on and washed after 4 hrs or so. No difference. I love the immediate effect. Haven't tried it during swimming though to see how the chlorine reacts to it. Ultimately, unless ive missed the ultimate tanner, this stuff rocks!",1
"I like the variety of colors, both matte and shimmery. The brush is not good though and I'd prefer more light colors, but overall, this is a good set.",1
"Works wonders on my hair. My hair has been very dry and damaged from too much straightening and curling from hot tools and my ends were starting to look terrible. To be honest, I have thin hair, do not get hair cuts often, and I blow dry and straighten or curl my hair almost every single day so my hair goes through a lot on a daily basis.  I heard about this product from a relative who is a hair stylist and she said she uses it often and it is amazing for your hair. I used it for the first time a few days ago but I did not have much time to keep it on for very long so I left it on around 15-20 mins and after blow drying my hair it looked much healthier. My hair was silky and soft with less visible damage and that was only after 1 use. I am very positive it will only get better the more I use it and the longer I keep in on my hair if it worked well after only one 15 min use.",1
Just trying it now....will know more later,1
"This is a a good product, but don't let the description fool you, it is not a water based product. The first ingredient is petrolatum. so you will
need to use shampoo to get this out of your hair. The hold is closer to medium than high. My hair is about 6 inches in length at it's longest point. It holds it fairly decently but when compared to other high hold products it doesn't have the same strength.  The shine I would rate closer to medium than low.",1
Very good! I like it!,1
"It smells wonderful and the product is great. But..The bottle unfortunately had a leak. Although it was taped down well and wrapped in bubble wrap, it still some how leaked. The bubble wrap was full of shampoo and sticky.",0
"This product is AMAZING I love every aspect of it from scent to the light hold it provides, works amazing with my thin and fine hair, lots of volume. It holds decent for a light hold, but is able to be restyled easily though the day and gives a lot of movement throughout the day.",1
This is my favorite scent of all time.  Great for your hair and does not leave any type of residue.,1
"I gave this a 4 out of 5 only because this particular rod was too large for me.  Only use this size if you have long hair or want the big, loose curls.  In general I LOVE the Hot Tools brand of curling irons.  My hair is very thick and doesn't curl easy, but my sister bought the 3/4"" barrel and I've tried it and it actually curls my hair and the curls last.  It heats up quickly and it does have temp settings, but I tend to keep mine at 8 to 10.  My hair doesn't get caught in these curling irons and I really like the grip I'm abel to get.",1
It works great and I wish my hair was long enough.  I consider my hair medium length and the barrel was too big.  I wish they made it in a 1 1/4 inch barrel. I also wish they included a thin heat resistant glove.,0
"Love this! I used this to bake and set my face and the finish to my skin was flawless. It kept my makeup on my oily skin all day and didn't cake up (when used with the setting spray). I currently use the Kat Von D setting powder and it's like air on the skin. I was expecting this powder to be less finely milled, but it's just as fine. I won't say it's *better* than Kat Von D but it's every bit as good.",1
Handle burns my hands!,0
"Been using this for a year. Not effective as far as whitening. Yes it does NOT give  day long protection against sweat. I guess it is because it is so gentle there's less aluminum in it.  But at least it doesn't make the pits darker like other deodorants do. My pits sweat but it does block the smell. I don't mind having sweaty pits as long as they don't stink. Also, it takes a while for the deodorant to dry because of it's weird consistency. But what I do, I use the hair dryer to speed up the drying process. ;)  Just got my second bottle. I'm not after it's whitening property anymore. I'm just soooo glad that it doesn't make them pits darker. :|",1
Fantastic manly smell.,1
this is a fake: it does not smell like the original. While in France I asked and it was confirmed that the Jean Patou brand had been discontinued...,0
I've been using Avne cream for a while and I decided to use this serum before putting cream on my face. This is smooth nice serum and makes me skin hydrated yet not oily. I'm in love!,1
"If you are looking at this product because somehow the name implies that it's 'water' and therefore better than say, something with silicone? It's not. It has silicone.

I've used a ton of primers, from cheap to pricey. This one falls somewhere towards the lower end of wear for me. I have combination skin (older skin to boot but I use peels) and this primer made my foundation patchy after a few hours. I'm currently wearing Lancme Teinte Idole 24Hr over their Lancme-branded Pro base. The Lancme foundation slid around on the Vincent Longo base. I normally get about 12 hours of uninterrupted wear out of the Lancme otherwise.

It did feel nice going on, and it smelled pleasant. But wear? Didn't do anything good for me.",0
it makes your hair softer,1
thank you,1
As a barber I need something reliable but this is not at all. Weak motor and it fell apart literally within a couple weeks of owning it.,0
Makes it silvery in just about 5 - 7 minutes for me. Tricky to get it even though! I would buy it again!!,1
"This is glaze, not gel.  It's not the same thing.  It won't hold your hair the way gel would.  They are misrepresenting their product.",0
Concept of beachwaver great but the reality is not.  Tends to pull on hair.  The piece that goes into the clip gets fried and looks bad.  Would not recommend and would like to return.,0
AMAZING! !!! LOVE it soo much. Great highlighter for warm/olive skin tone! !!,1
"This shampoo made my head itch, its too overpriced and way too thick. Sorry, I had big expectations.",0
I'm a fan of the Refreshing Gel. This one was more expensive and a HUGE let down. Actually dried my skin out and left zero radiance. Save your money.,0
"This one did not work for me. As much as I love the ingredients in this product, if I use it consistently my cuticles actually dry up and flake after a few days. At first I thought it was unrelated to this product, but when I tried using it again, my cuticles started having flaky skin only to the areas that I applied this product. Too much of a coincidence, so I stopped using it all together and I no longer have that problem. I went back to using a thick hand cream and massaging that really well into my cuticles.",0
Pricy,1
I ordered 8 and only received 1. Where are the other 7 Guinot Liftsome Firming??,0
"I needed a new hair dryer for my thick, color treated hair.  I read all the reviews on this and a few other dryers.  So glad I opted with this one.  The first time I used it, it was so powerful that it knotted my hair but that was my own fault.  It dries my half in about half the time - I love it.",1
What a special treat!  LOVE this product!,1
Great to retain curl without over-drying. Nice scent.,1
The lip gloss feels really good on.  The color is very light so it probably doesnt matter which shade you get as it is really only a tint.  It last as long as most lip glosses so you need to reapply throughout the day.  It has a light fragrance and is not gooey.  It does not build up in the corners of your mouth or on your lower lip like some glosses do.  I  applied my normal lipstick color  first and then applied the gloss.  It did not change the color but provided a nice shine.,1
"I pay about $16 or $17 dollars for this stuff in the stores. So, the online price is fantastic. This is a staple product for me. It works. It does what it says. After I've finished the bottle, I can go about a month or two without it. Typically, I might apply the second bottle only once per week or so, giving my nails little breaks in between before repeating the process. OPI makes a follow up treatment for this product, used for maintenance, but I haven't tried it yet since it's harder to find in my area. I know the price seems a little expensive to some, but, for me, it's worth every penny.

I've been using this product for about 2 years. After you've stopped using this product for 2 months or so, your nails go back to normal. I've always had long nails, but after my second pregnancy my nails would break very easily. I tried gel overlays over my natural nails for awhile, but that process actually destroyed my natural nails. I cut them off, let them grow out, and have been using Nail Envy ever since.

Nail Envy seems to make the nail a bit thicker. I still break nails from time to time (especially if they're getting TOO long), but no where near as often as I do without this product.

A hair stylist recommended that I forget about the gel and try this product. I had very little hope that it measured up to all the hype, but (obviously) I was pleasantly surprised. Nail Envy does not work instantly. When you're just starting out (or starting over) with Nail Envy, you  have to use this product as directed for at least 2 weeks before you see a difference. I have recommended this product to other people who did not follow the instructions, and they did not get the results. For the first week and a half or so, your nails may still break and do whatever it is that they typically do. Just give it time. Use as directed, and you will be very happy with the results! (Be *sure* to cut/file/buff out any splits in your nails. Nail Envy will not repair or mend damage that has already occurred to the nail.)",1
Im not a big fan of nudes as prefer green and purple eye shadow but JI nude palette is a nice daytime look. Rich colors and easy to apply,1
Great product!,1
Beautiful color.,1
"Very greasy, and when you blot all the color goes away.  If you're looking for a lip gloss you may like this.  A disappointing EA product.",0
"It absolutely DOES work and last more than any other natural deodorant we have tried. Not a huge fab of its scent, but better than B.O. ;)",1
funny to use not worth the money,0
"I would not buy this , it's not a good straightener",0
Thank you,1
This is overpriced clear nail polish which chipped the day after I put it on.,0
"I've used Chi products before and I liked the idea of products from a renowned brand with natural ingredients so I gave it a try. At first I liked it but then I realized it made my hair fall a lot. I used it with the CHI Olive Nutrient Therapy, the glaze, and Organics Olive Nutrient Therapy Silk Oil from the same line of products. As soon as I realized how my hair was falling I stopped using this item. It was a good idea from Chi but didn't like how it performed. Also, while it doesn't have parabens and has some healthy ingredients it's not completely natural as it has some harmful ingredients like Phenoxyethanol among others.",0
Feels mentholated...burns your skin.  Would not recommend.,0
"I could not tolerate the scent this lotion.  I bought it on reviews that the scent was mild, but I disagree.  I have heard good things about this product, so was anxious to try it, but it was not for me.",0
Nice feel on face.,1
I have tried every type of mascara out there . High and low prices . This is by far my favorite of all of them . It makes me look like I have lashes and I was not blessed with them ! I am a professional cosmetologist so when I say I've tried them all I mean every kind imaginable.  I would have given this mascara a 5 rating but it was about ten dollars to high . I bought most of the other Balm brand mascaras at my beauty supply but they didn't have this particular 1 available.  It is also the best Balm mascara in my opinion for sure !,1
Good Stuff!!!,1
"I have used this shampoo for years and love it.  This is the older product as pictured, not the newer version.",1
Not the real deal. Ugh.,0
"My product had no seal on it (like other Bliss lotion products that I've purchased).  Not sure if this is normal or not, but seemed as though the product had already been open/used, and the smell was a little odd.",0
"Been using this for a few weeks and I love it. It's very gentle, smells fresh and doesn't have a billion ingredients I can't pronounce.",1
"My hair don't look shiny at all. And for the price, I can't believe it. I know quite well this mark, and used to buy it in France, but never that disappointed. Also because I paid it less money.",0
Love this stuff!,1
Pricey,1
Wonderful product,1
"Not the same ingredients as the original and not as thick or easy to use.  I received a sample of the original -- same name, same look, but totally different and wonderful ingredients.  This is NOT the same.",0
"Works well, just don't use to much",1
Sturdy powerful machine for thicker hair. Straightforward to use. Good value (for the 2 months I've had it so far),1
The best razor ever!,1
A++++,1
"Not a big fan of this.  Read so many good reviews, but it just doesn't work for me.  It has a really strange texture that is hard to describe, and the ""Natural glow"" is really light.  This does seem relatively expensive for a ""sample"" size, but it was worth it to me to avoid spending more than double this price for the full size since I don't like it anyway.",0
Best lotion ever! I have man hands and it goes on dry and stays on for at least two hand washes.,1
Didn't realize there were two colors. Also amount is greatly reduced from last I got!,0
"Not sure if product formula changed or what: I was recently introduced to this product and was given a sample to try. It was clear just like the product I ordered yet it is like spraying conditioner on my hair, does nothing for volume. Very disappointed.",0
"Half as much as the normal blue line, but double the price. Doesnt feel or work better than the normal Zirh, do not recomend.",0
"Works well, but very expensive for the amount you get.",1
it was way too light and didn't have good coverage.,0
I just tried this product today. Many say it is messy. It isn't too messy when you apply but as it dries its a bit powdery. My skin felt soft afterward. Good product! Will update review after a few uses.,1
I bought this because I loved the tiny sample that camewith the Clarisonic. It smells so refreshing and I look forward to washing my face with this cleanser.,1
I wouldn't buy this again as it is hard to apply and blend.,0
"My wife uses this for her hands and we have ordered it again. It comes in a small tube but she says a little dab will do ya, so it lasts for a while. Nice scent as well.",1
This was a mistake on my part.  I did not realize there was a difference between Extra Body Finishing Spray and Extra Body FIRM Finishing Spray.  The Firm spray is better for my fine hair.,0
I ave not used his product for very long but it works. It kind of smells bad but that goes away quickly. The results have been very satisfying,1
"I can't stand this stuff. I have used far better 10% BP washes. I habitually use another brand, but when it was sold out I tried this. After one use my skin was drier and more sensitive than I've ever experienced, accompanied by a burning sensation. I reduced my use of it because I really wasn't willing to allow my acne to run rampant, but it just was not worth it. I know you may think, ""Hey, 10% BP, of course it's going to dry your skin a little."" No, seriously, this was way worse than I would have ever expected. I cannot, in good confidence, recommend this product to anyone.",0
It was a gift.,1
The only reason I'm giving a low review of this product is that When I read the label I noticed it has parabens in it. That is something I try to avoid with sensitive skin.,0
"I ordered two cans of this hairspray, andWhen I went to use the first scan it was half gone and the spray nozzle sticks and does not spray correctly. So, I got the second can out and it is the same way.",0
"Didn't like it. It leaves a not very fresh sent in my hair. It smells nice when you put it on, but then after you drying your hair it leaves a weird smell.",0
"This smelled horrible on me - like a walking dryer sheet. Perhaps it's better for different people, but I couldn't wear it.",0
Nice stuff,1
Such a smooth feeling. This stuff really smells great!,1
This is a fantastic product. The quality of this eye serum is impressive. Not much is needed and will last for many months.,1
"I ordered ""bliss Body Butter, Lemon + Sage"" but received a different flavor of ordered product ""bliss Body Butter, grapefruit + aloe"".",0
"Maybe it's what they use for the sunscreen, but this foundation settled into my pores and looked horrible. I tried putting a moisturizer under it, but it didn't help. Maybe it would work if I use a primer, but I'm not really into a lot of fuss. A young woman with smooth skin might not have this complaint. The opal color was exactly right for my skin tone, which is very fair. But I guess my go-to product will remain&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BOOTS-No7-Dual-Action-Tinted-Moisturiser/dp/B00BN7FCU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BOOTS No7 Dual Action Tinted Moisturiser)</a>.",0
"I wanted to love this Jane Iredale Jelly Jar because of the non-toxic ingredients for my sensitive skin.  Although the shade of espresso compliments my skin nicely, the eyeliner goes on rather sheer and takes several applications to get a semi-opaque line.  Despite trying with and without primer, and trying to set the gel with a overlay of eye shadow, the eyeliner doesn't set; it will rub off relatively easy later in the day.  Overall, this eyeliner is not sufficiently pigmented and doesn't last long enough for me.  After many attempts to make it work for me, I'm realizing that I just missed the 30-day return cut-off, so sadly a waste of money for me.",0
Tan color is too light for black people with medium complexion.,0
Very good..,1
I think this cream was old shelf life because the color and the smell. I really wish I could've gotten on a department store or spa.,0
It didn't work,0
Does just what it says it does. Easy to use and gently straightens/smooths hair.  Costs a little more than I think it should but several friends recommended the product so I thought I would give it a try.,1
"Works great, can dry out your skin and it is pink so I only use at bedtime.",1
THIS product is absolutely NOT the real stuff. Don't waste your money!,0
this smells amazing and works great!!,1
"Disappointed, too sticky.",0
"I gave this cream two stars. While it does produce a fairly slick lather, the shave it produces has a strange feel that is difficult to explain. Reading all of the positive reviews I really wanted to like this cream. From a local AOS store I purchased the sandalwood scent. To be fair, the scent was quite pleasant. However, using a straight razor, the first shave was not very good. I don't really understand any of the reviews that claim this cream produces a thick lather.  Quite the opposite in fact, the cream didn't hold its consistency and seemed somewhat watery. It also left my face red and burned. Being fairly expert I don't think I have had a cut or burn in years. But after watching several videos of people raving about it, I gave the cream 5 or 6 more tries. The shaves got a little better, the trick seems to be to use almost no water, and use a lot of cream (say a liberal three dollops worth) and then whip the crap out of it for about 4 minutes. However, even using more of it, the lather still has trouble holding its consistency and fluffing up into a good cushion.  While I don't like comparing products in a review, since it seems the battle of luxury creams is between Taylor of Old Bond Street and AOS, as far as cushion, thickness, consistency, and even price, Taylor of Old Bond Street is by far the superior product - as one modest dollop of TOBS is easily enough for three or more very fluffy passes, along with a 5.3 ounce tub going for $16.00 - $17.00.

Taking the sandalwood version back to the store, they were very understanding, and they offered to exchange it with the unscented version. I gave it two or three shaves and it produced the same result. Both versions left my skin irritated and red, albeit smoothly shaved, and both were difficult to work up to a good lather. Two things also stood out in addition to the shaving aspect.  First, the cream leaves a strange residue on your skin, as well as on anything it happens to touch.  My shaving bowl/cup was covered with it. In addition when it is heated in hot water it gives off an ungodly odor that smells like a burning tire, more so with the unscented version.  Not sure what that's all about but in decades of shaving i've never smelled anything like it.  Maybe there's just too many chemicals or something.

I would say overall that while it is possible to get a smooth shave out of this cream, it may not be worth the price given the fantastic other shaving options out there.  If your willing to spend $25.00, save your money and buy a better razor, and find a cheaper tallow based, low chemical cream or soap that will not irritate your skin, and also produce a thicker lather.",0
Broke within a year,0
"My sister recommended the Matrix Biolage Full Density Thickening shampoo. She loves it and buys hers at the local salon. I was eager to try the shampoo, conditioner and densifying treatment spray myself. I do like the thickness of the product. I like the large bottles. I have pumps to make getting the product out easier. The shampoo and conditioner smell lovely but the densifying spray smells like lighter fluid, literally.

I have used it for two weeks and it makes my hair feel like it has been slathered with bacon grease. I cannot transfer the grease to my fingers but my hair feels terribly matted down with grease. Ugh! I tried not using the conditioner. I tried not using the finishing spray. I tried only the shampoo. I still had the same results. I am saving all of these Matrix products for her when I see her next. I am surprised that she loves loves it, and I don't.",0
Excellent!,1
i love ouidad products- but this one doesn't make my hair feel soft- it actually felt more dry- so i gave it 2 stars because i love all their other products-,0
"Doesn't seem to add volume, makes my hair feel a bit sticky. Smells nice though.",0
its not long lasting. i thought the fragnance gonna stay long but its just too light to saty and disappear,0
"I live off of these rash cream for my second daughter.  Her skin is very sensitive esp in the diaper area.  Her area turns pink if she's in her diaper even after peeing once versus my other daughter, she can stay in her diaper for a while and her skin would be fine.

I like the fact that it's made up of 98% ingredients from natural origins.  Meaning it's ingredients are from plant extracts, etc.  The paste is a bit more liquidy than to what I'm used to.  Usually these ointments are a thicker paste so you would only need to apply one layer.  Since it was a bit more liquidy than usual, I had to let it dry a little bit and then apply on another layer.  The stuff does work though and my daughter's stubborn rash were gone the very next day.",1
This curling iron doesn't meet my needs and doesn't work the way it was described. When I went to return it I was told I couldn't! There was nothing that indicated that this item couldn't be returned when I ordered it. Buyer beware!!!!,0
Curls don't stay,0
My bottle arrived without a seal and 3/4 empty...,0
"WARNING: This is not a 4mL supply! It is a 2mL supply that arrives with a hand placed ""4mL"" sticker over the ""2mL"" on the box. Do not purchase this item. Amazon refunded my money immediately. However; someone who had never purchased the product would most likely not know the difference in the bottle size and would unknowingly keep the deceptively sold item.",0
Best toothpaste! You will be addicted.,1
allergic reaction be careful and how would you cover hair if you got none left to cover because of that product.,0
"Works pretty well. Love the smell of this thing.  If you've ever used Pert Plus back in the day, it totally reminds me of that clean smell.",1
Great Product ! Will be purchasing another.,1
This product looks exactly  everything but smells a bit old..not exact.,0
"i didn't really notice a difference if i did or did not use this, but if your skin reacts to salicylic  acid, then it might work for you",0
Did not care for at all. Didn't even seem like a dry shampoo. Will not be purchasing this again,0
It was too thick for someone with fine lines.,0
My son has sensitive skin and this is one of the only things he can use when his hand are dry.  Highly recommend it!,1
"Very lightweight but has good coverage.
Works well under make-up.
Perfect size for traveling.
The drawback is that it is very expensive but it's worth the money.",1
"Love the lipstick. More of a coral thanks expected. Keep in mind this is a matte, so it kind of turns into a powdery(ish) finish on your lips. The plus side is that it's SUUUPER long ware. Made it through a couple cups of coffee and lunch before reapplying it.",1
Fit with my flash&go but wouldn't work. It kept telling me to change the cartridge :(,0
Love what these have done for my skin. Discoloration is fading in the first month. Breakouts controlled... So worsth it!,1
"Great to be able to try a travel size for this.  However, it didn't cover bare spots of scalp.  I kept scratching my scalp ~ feeling that it was dirty.  This was recommended by a hairstylist, so I was willing to try it, but would not purchase it again.",0
"IVE ordered from Topix before. I will continue to use it until I finish but will not buy it anymore. The other thing, it keeps getting clogged up so I have to unscrew to get any out. I end up using more than I need because of that.",0
This curling iron is as good as the proffessionals use. You can rate the heat and it has a stand to set on your vanity so it won't burn it. It eve comes with an 2nd spring for the holder.,1
"i expected it to have staying power because its name is spackle!

but it doesn't have much staying power. . . . .",1
"I usually LOVE Hot Tools products, but this one never worked properly.  The first time I plugged it in it never got warm so I returned it.  So sad because my last Hot Tools curling iron lasted years!",0
Still the best on the market.  Would recommend this and the shampoo to anyone.,1
Leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean.,1
Normaly this product is very good but I purchased some from Amazon and it was not the same product that you would purchase at your hair care provider.  I believe it is an immitation product.  I recommend this product if you purchase directly from your hair care provider but would not recommend purchasing this item from Amazon.,0
"This is certainly a thick cream! I like that because you can really control the amount you use. And you only need a small (very small!) amount at a time. If you use too much, you'll get that greasy feeling. I think the scent is pleasant; it seems a bit strong out of the jar, but as it goes on your skin, it seems to lighten up a bit and I don't find any real lingering scent. I've used it pretty much everywhere on my body and prefer it for my arms (elbows) and my feet (heels). I don't really think it's an intensive body repair treatment, as the name indicates. Especially for the price ($113.00 is the going rate on Amazon as of this review, for a 10 oz. jar). It does the job as a moisturizer and I was fortunate enough to get it as a freebie, but I don't think I would purchase it again for that price.",1
WISH THEY WOULD SEND ME A REPLACEMENT. THE CARTRIDGE RAN OUT SO FAST. THE ITEM BROKE WITHIN 10 MONTHS. NOT TOO HAPPY WITH THIS EXPERIENCE.,0
Did not give me the results that I was hoping.  Waste of money.,0
"This is good stuff.  But you need to be careful about how much you press out, and it has a moist finish.  When it is hot, I finish it with some loose powder and it stays on all day.",1
This is amazing!! I just followed the directions on the box and voila! My skin has never felt so soft in so long! I was really impressed with this product. I have very sensitive skin and i didn't have any type of reaction at all. Would totally reccomend to people woth or without sensitive skin. I also made my husband use it and he even liked it !,1
Bayliss was not as tight feeling when hair is in straightener.,0
"I like this cleanser because it smells great, cleans my skin without stripping or drying it out, and a little goes a long way.",1
"I should have known it was a bad sign when the box came completely open and destroyed. Thankfully everything inside was still wrapped so I decided to give it a try anyway. Within a few days I saw my skin get redder and more sensitive than it ever was before. I don't know if there's something in the products I was allergic to, but I had to quit it.",0
"Definitely not a good idea to get colors of Butter polish online. Much better to buy from the store. I have a store I can use at the Seattle airport and I chose a much better color for my skin tone. Have not used the product long enough to say if it is a good quality product. Goes on OK, but time will tell if it will endure properly. Love their lip gloss though.",0
Emollient and not greasy. I don't see a difference though.,0
"A good face scrub, but a bit course and a bit drying.  Found a better product at Clarins.",1
"I tried this color at the salon before buying, loved it, got a lot of compliments, so bought it here.  At the salon they used the UV light, at home I have an LED curing light.  Worked great at home, lasted a solid week with no signs of wear.  color was true.",1
"I first purchased this in Monaco.  I was only able to find more from the states via Amazon and am thrilled to finally have more.  It is not heavy like many products, but yet it is rich and very soothing to dry skin.",1
DID NOT WORK WELL FOR US. TOO THICK.,0
"Awesome eye gel works better than ANY other de-puffer I've ever used, better than any women's product at least.",1
I use with a Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver and I shave in the shower. I have gotten very good results with this product. It is a bit pricey which is why I gave it 4 stars.,1
Does absolutely nothing.  Total waste of money.  All those pictures you see of long thick lashes are either natural or they have extensions on.  Don't waste your money.,0
"Not sure what I did to order this.  I suspect it was tangled into the ordering page as some promotion and I just clicked GO.
If you want 14 tiny-tiny-tiny, mostly one time use samples .... it is great.
Otherwise, this purchase is worthless.",0
"After all the positive reviews I leave for all my Amazon products this is one I have to give a negative one. I put a few sprays and smells good but after an hour can't even tell I have anything on. The past couple of days i almost seem to drench my self with it and by an hour or two couldn't even tell I had it on. I put 2 sparys of my other cologne and that almost last through out the day,Curve which I bought at the store. Hopefully the other colognes I purchased through Amazon smell better.",0
Burns and inflames face.,0
"The smell can be strong to some, but it's refreshing to me.  The hold is touchable and yet strong.",1
"Musk-laden, manly scent.  Not overbearing in spice.  Pleasant and mild.",1
"Phyto lists this product as being 'sans rincage', but surprisingly this oil is a bit on the heavier side for me. I find this strange seeing as my hair is rather thick and coarse, and since I flat iron my hair often and live in a dry, arid region of the US, I need oil to help with sun damage and heat styling. I tried using this product different ways - on semi-dry hair lightly blown out on 'cool' and then on damp, towel-dried tresses. Either way, within 24 hours my hair was starting to look a little oily, even when used sparingly (1 pump into palm) and carefully brushed through sectioned hair. On the upside, it does leave behind a gorgeous shine and has a pleasant, vintage floral aroma that fades within an hour or so. After comparing it with a similarly priced luxury hair oil, it does soften my dry hair significantly better, with less fragrance and more nurturing ingredients (no silicone). I think this oil works best either used pre-cleansing or as a leave-in substitute for traditional conditioning (it's rich enough), which is how I plan on enjoying this in the future.",1
Good,1

"This is a great highlighter/luminizer.  Be aware, tho, that a little goes a long way!  Not something I'd necessarily use during the day unless I blended it really well.

Days without showers are terrifying, however, with this dry shampoo I've even been able to challenge myself to go 2 days in between without washing - and not out of necessity. The application can be a bit of a mess since it's not sprayed on but rather squeezed out in a cloud, but it's worth it. I've found that applying the night before works really well for me.",1

"This is my first experience with any Proraso product, and I am happy I gave it a shot. The pros are it's easy to lather, nice thick lather, provided good protection, and was nice and slick. Now the cons it smells a little off to me, but that might just be the eucalyptus in it as its my first experience with it. You can definitely feel the menthol in it after applying to you face. All in all I would recommend this product, I will be buying the Proraso Tin after I use this up.",1
"They changed the formula majorly since all of these awesome reviews. Before the ingredients were:

Deionized Water (Aqua),Aloe (Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice) Vera Gel,Bladderwrack (Fucus Vesiculous) Extract,Herbal Extract,Rose (Rosa Gallica) Extract,Gardenia (Gardenis Florida) Extract,Propylene Glycol.

The new ingredients are:
Aqua (Water,Eau),Propylene Glycol,Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice,Rosa Canina Extract,Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme) Leaf Extract,Fucus Vesiculosus Extract,Gardenia Florida Fruit Extract,Caprylyl Glycol,Hexylene Glycol,Polysorbate 20,Parfum (Fragrance),Phenoxyethanol,Sodium Chloride,Citronellol,Geraniol,CI 17200 (Red 33),CI 42090 (Blue 1)

They've added way more of the glycols, propylene glycol used to be the last ingredient and now it's second, which is room for concern (glycols are alcohols and alcohols are drying), and now ethanol is in it (an even worse alcohol). Ethanol makes products quickly dry which makes them feel weightless on the skin for cheap... HOWEVER, ethanol causes irritation to the skin and is bad for ALL skin types, which you will see if you buy this product. Just do a google search and see for yourself. Some alcohols are okay, but not ethanol! I have very clear skin and never have bad breakouts. My skin is not sensitive and I really never worry about using anything on it because it's just rarely an issue. The day after I used this I had a terrible breakout, worse than any other skin product ever has. I'm really disappointed and wish I could get my hands on the old formula that everyone loved so much.",0

"Ok,  the product seems nice enough.  It felt really greasy at first,  and took a long time to dry,  but it seems adequate.  Smells like grapefruit.
However,  the inside of the lid was busted,  and the box was all wonky, as if this was a returned item. I'm being honest here,  JUST AS THE SELLERS SHOULD BE.
So,  I'll keep the stuff and use it up,  but I likely won't but it again,  at least not from this seller.
Buyer beware.",1
"The scent of this refresh shampoo is a bit too strong for me, however at the price I'm obligated to finish the bottle.  I like the way it is very gentle and my strands never feel dry after I rinse.

I have never had a problem using Amazon before, but will never buy this product from Amazon again.",0
Wow I just got this today and I have the one with the plug in cord. Let me just begin by saying i expected a lot from a device I paid over $100 for and I expected it to work! But guess what? It doesn't even light up! The blue light flickered for a second and it turned off! The head however remained hot making you think it's on but trust me it's not! What a waste of time and money avoid buying this at all cost! Also it irritated my skin maybe I got a defective one but wow I can't even imagine it being great if it did.,0

"I've been looking for a conditioner for my super-fine, naturally pale blonde hair that won't weigh it down.  This isn't it.  My goal is to avoid damage and breakage - especially when combing while wet.  I always comb through my wet hair with a wide tooth comb before rinsing the conditioner out, and had to use quite a bit of the product to enable this.  At the price of the product, this could get quite expensive.  Unfortunately, the amount needed to detangle is also too much for my hair and I ended up with flat, stringy hair.  So, I'm still on the hunt for a good conditioner for my hair type.  One extra word of caution - this product line is definitely geared toward chemically treated hair, even though the stylists seem to think it'll be fine for untreated blonde hair.  It's not...the shampoo has a green tint to it that may be good to counteract brassiness from the chemicals, but for those of us that don't have the natural pigments - it will give your hair a greenish cast!",0
Got this on an Amazon deal and it's awesome! Use it twice a day and it keeps my skin so clear.,1
"One of the worst things Ive bought in a long time. Almost threw it away. Like spreading slightly tinted lip balm on your lids. Just nothing I had hoped it would be. Almost clear, sticky, just bad. Wishing for my 28 bucks back so I could put it towards the Charolette Tilbury cream shadow",0

"Great moisture for my very dry, very reactive skin. Its makes my skin shine, which I love because normally I am very scaly looking. It last all day too. Excellent product that actually helps calm down my red swollen skin, especially right after I get out of the shower, great product.",1
Very good product and is very inexpensive especially when you compare it to other stores. Does a very job and with a mint smell.,1
I love this night cream. My skin look smoother and hydrated immediately after applying. I use this with other obagi products.,1
"Packaging was bad, it came half empty from spilling in the box. However, customer service sorted that out for me. The only complaint I have about this product is that the smell is a little overbearing (like strong roses and chemicals), and that you need to be careful about misting directly onto your face because it burns eyes a lot. I recommend spraying it onto a cotton pad and then running it over your face (dabbing didn't work that well, wiping was better). After washing my face the night before, and thinking I didn't have an ounce of make up left on my face, I noticed on the cotton pad that I still had some foundation left! Besides it's cleaning aspect, it definitely makes my skin feel soft. I'm on acutane right now and it didn't make my skin hurt like other toners I have used.",1

"Knowing nothing about chemistry I cannot vouch for the efficacy of the components of this cream but after a week of use my skin does look more hydrated and it feels soft. I live in a climate with temperature extremes made worse because there I little humidity.

These factors take a visible toll so regular use of face creams is an essential part of my routine. And although I don't expect aging to stop or retreat, I do need products I use to provide solid performance to protect my skin from what can feel like an environmental assault.

Directions are to use the thick cream in the morning and evening. So with a cotton swab I apply a bit more than a pea-size dollop to my face and an equivalent amount on my neck. Based on that usage after a week I estimate the 1.7 ounce jar should last four to six weeks but this will vary.

Some products seem to sit on the surface of the skin leaving a greasy look but this moisturizer is quickly absorbed without leaving a shiny film. I have experienced no sensitivities, irritations or break-outs from the cream and so far I am pleased with the results.",1
"I saw this straightener used on an Instagram video, found it on Amazon and read the reviews. I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend that much $$ but a review about how good it was on fine hair and another referencing ""just one pass"" intrigued me and they were both right! I immediately opened the box, read the general instructions, plugged it in, waited for the light to stop blinking and grabbed a piece of my hair that wouldn't be noticeable if it burned straight off. Amazing! One straight pass, awesome curls or waves or straight, guides smoothly, perfect compact size.",1

"I've been using pureology for years. If you buy it in the salon, it is pretty expensive, so I figured I would just bite the bullet and buy a big bottle to use. The first time I used this I thought that it felt a little different, but didn't think anything about it. Then I realized that instead of going 5 or 6 weeks between coloring my hair, my color was fading in 1 or 2 weeks... Pureology is the best color safe hair products on the market, so it is CLEAR that this isn't what it is supposed to be.",0
"While this is an excellent product, I'm not sure that it's worth as much as they're charging for it.  Nivea and Neutrogena both make face washes that I think are just as good for half the price.

If you're going to splurge on a Jack Black product, I'd recommend trying the beard lube (shaving cream), which is the only product they make that I find really superior to the less expensive options.",1
It's a little more yellow than I expected but I'm willing to try another shade as I like the other qualities of this pressed base...covers nicely - not too heavy and doesn't irritate my rosacea.,1
"I have naturally curly hair that tends to frizz in humid weather. The Moroccanoil is the only product that I have used so far that does not leave a sticky residue and tames my frizz. It is a light smelling oil that you do not notice once it is on your hair. A little bit goes a long way, depending on the thickness and length of your hair. It also helps to ease the itchiness of my scalp in the dry winter months. I am glad that my friend recommended this product to me.",1
great hair gel that I have been using for at least 10 years. hold hair perfectly and doesn't flake at all. Holds forever. Awesome product!,1

"Like many buyers of this brand I discovered this soap while staying at the Four Seasons hotels in Westlake village,ca. These bars smell so good and they last for nearly two months.  Thats just a 2oz bath size ,I can only imagine what the 8oz will stay useful? I have used these soaps for showers due to my water softner and the risk of slipping. Never drying nor any setbacks like itching,sticky film or lots of soap scum. Luxury all wrapped up in one bar",1
"***UPDATE****  1/31/14

Okay so after using Caboki, I realized that caboki stays on the hair way more than toppik!!
Caboki is easier to apply and looks more natural. I've been using both and the difference is night and day. I'm not saying toppik is bad but to me caboki is the best product to use.
It's also 100% NATURAL so that makes me feel way better. Combined with a natural hairspray I don't think you could go wrong with this product.

Toppik does use  chemicals to dye the fibers :(
That always made me feel uncomfortable.

So being that caboki gives you a free sample for 6.99 S&H I highly suggest you try it.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************

So I got the product yesterday and tested it.. when i first put on head i was pretty blown away as I'm sure most people who use this are. Its like you see your hair growing in front of your eyes instantly. Can be pretty eerie for others to see it too.

So I am actively testing this and I found that it does stay in pretty good as long as none touches your head.
If you touch your head while this is in, it will rub off on your hands and look like carbon dust.

I rubbed my head to see it come off and reveal my scalp. If this were to happen while i was out it could be pretty embarrassing. It would not be good.

I also sprayed some strong hair spray lightly and evenly in areas where i put the fibers on to give it some extra strength.

Now all in all its an amazing product but be careful for scratching your head or someone touching your head accidentally in a friend to friend hug or anything like that.

I also ordered the Caboki Hair Building Fibers to test out. They are supposed to be 100% natural and have a better cling to your hair.
It should be here in a few days I ordered the free trial at caboki.com
I want to test and see which one works better.
They say Caboki is the leader and with no chemicals and fda approval it should be the way to go. check it out

I am very satisfied with the purchase. well worth the 20 bucks and the color matched well.",1
"Good quality product, but I don't have the patience to curl such small sections of my eye lash at a time.  I returned it with no problem.",1
Great product. Just too small. Ordered the 1/2 in --Wish I would've ordered next size up.,0
"This is NOT a wax. This product is actually more of a styling gel. I have a fairly long mustache, which may just not agree with this product. It seems I either don't get enough in to make a difference or too much and cause a soaking wet over bodied mess. Once dry the hair feels stiff, but doesn't hold in place like a quality wax would. The smell is very nice, and it may work great on a shorter mustache or in actual head hair.",0
I got it and have never used it bevause it came very dry and flacky right out of the tube. makes me sad because I really like stila makeup proibbaly will never buy it again.. but I love the water proof liquid liner,0

"My wife and I just bought this cream to try out, as we are just starting to research eye creams. I think it's great for the price point since all the other high-rated creams are exponentially higher in price.

pretty good i did not notice it as a result i was told to put it at night and morning the pimples have really disappeared i did not see it,0
This stuff made me breakout in hives to come find out they changed the ingredients.,0

"I have wide pores and mostly oily skin. I've had a clarisonic for Years. Decided to give this guy a try. I like that it comes in yellow, has a long charge, is silicone, is compact. I'm glad I got it on sale during Amazon prime days. Why?  This does Not clean any better than clarisonic. Straight up. Does not. Honestly, for my skin, the clarisonic does a little better. So if you're trying to decide between the 2 products, I'd say pick this just cuz of the charge factor and slightly better the the environment-ness of it.

And for those crabbing about the price of the brush heads for clarisonic, order a 4 pack from China. Takes longer to get to you but you get 4 for the price of 1.",1

Love it,1
"I would have given this product 5 stars but the pump on mine didn't work (maybe something happened during shipping). I also don't like the packaging as you can't know for sure how low you are running until it might be too late. As for the product itself; it is great! You won't be disappointed. It doesn't have any chemical smells, goes on smoothly and feels silky. I have very oily skin and when using this product don't feel like I am ""adding"" anything extra that will clog my pores. I do thing my skin looks shinier but I just dab some translucent powder and problem solved.",1

"I've had my own uv lamp for a while, so with trial and error, I have learned a thing or two about the process of giving myself a uv manicure. One thing that is essential is that you must wipe your nails with rubbing alcohol between EVERY layer (every time you cure). Once before you start, once after your base, after the color (every time you apply a new layer) and again after the top coat.
  It took me applying 4 layers of the color to have it look acceptable. Imagine crushing up a bunch of gray chalk (I bought the color city scape) and mixing it with water.. It didn't go on evenly and it was not thick enough at all!! Every time I would cure (even after adding extra time) and wipe my nails, a lot of the color would rub right off.
  I will just spend a few extra bucks on opi.",0
"So I read all of the reviews for this hair color pen and I was prepared to hate it.  The reviews at Sephora aren't nearly as bad as the ones on Amazon.

Anyhow, I have a smattering of gray hairs - I was plucking them but it's gotten to the point where that is not going to work anymore.  I was reluctant to start full head hair dying - too much of a cost and time committment.... so a friend who went prematurely gray in her 30s recommended that I just get a touch up pen and individually color the hairs that are bothering me.

After reviewing the options out there, I decided on this Oscar Blandi Pronto pen.  It's a PAIN to individually color my gray hairs but it works well.  The color is natural, the pen comes with a little comb (think mascara sized comb) and when I get clumps, I just use the comb to smooth them out.  The coverage of my grays is EXCELLENT and the color blends in really well with my natural hair color.  The tip of the pen is very flexible with soft bristles, think Stila lip gloss, so it's pretty easy to use.

Overall, I'm happy with this as a temporary way to color my grays....I only wish the dye in the product were permanent.",1
Very disappointed it smells like alcohol,0
Had high hopes for this wand but was quickly deceived. I have straight thin hair and tried this iron for a month straight on the highest heat setting. My hair would not keep the curl. Had better results with my cheap Walmart Conair curling iron. Super sad this iron didn't work out.,0
I ordered 2 bottles. One of the bottle was leaking and the liquid turned to black. The other one was safe.,0
"I found the smell of the cleanser a little off putting. This is typical of organics so it's no surprise, just a bit hard to take for me. My daughter has used it now for three days and her skin has shown a marked improvement in blemishes and in overall tone. . Neither of us cared for the moisturizer and the amount of peel included in this kit is miniscule.  Still, the cleanser and serum work well together and do offer results. If any of these items are offered separately, those are the two I would recommend.",1
"I love LORAC's brow powder and the pencil was recommended to me. It may have just been my technique, but while the color was perfect, I found it to not be as soft and natural as the powder.",0
"I have other CND shellac colors that work great, but this particular one bubbles up under my u.v. Light. I'm disappointed.",0
I honestly bought these for the brand name. Henckels is a well known household name and quality German steel. These however are very flimsy and do not remind me of my well balanced kitchen knife. I found myself trying to uncover the secret in manipulating the clippers to actually work and sure enough with the right touch they worked. It did give me a clean cut and I didn't have to file my nails so it did the job with some finesse but the search for the best nail clippers continue. Stay tuned!,0
bad ingredients. this irritated my skin - should have read the reviews and not fallen for the hype. sad!,0
left the hair very dry,0
"I'm a male 35 male with normal hair that has thinned a bit as I've aged, but I' not balding or anything. My hair isn't real thick anymore though. I got a sample of this conditioner (the older product Moisture Scentsation. I liked it so much I had to buy this 33 ounce big bottle of conditioner and shampoo! The conditioner is slightly less potent than the previous product it replaced Moisture Scentsation, but with all the  extra amount you get for the cheaper price, you can still get the same effect by using a bit more conditioner.

It smells super minty and makes your head tingle, love it. The best part is when you dry your hair it falls perfectly with no residue on it. Other conditioners made my hair feel and look weighed down like it was coated too heavily, but not this stuff. It is awesome and worth every penny!

I would have given this a 5 star review if it were just as good as potent as the conditioner it replaced, the abba Moisture Scentsation, but it is still great.

Biolage used to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner until I got the abba Moisture shampoo and conditioner. Especially for normal or fine hair, if you use the shampoo and conditioner, your hair will come out like silk and lay perfect (with no weighed down residue feeling) after a blow dry!

One note I will make is that this is a new replacement product for the smaller more potent (and expensive) abba Moisture Scentsation shampoo. It is only a little less potent. You may have to use a bit more to get the same effect, but its worth the cost savings if you're not rich. If you are rich, get the older slightly better products here before they are gone. They got discontinued from what I understand due to this product replacing it.

Awesome product overall. My hair is a purple ombre and it helps keep the color. Super plus that it smells like cupcakes or baked goods. Highly recommend.(( don't listen to reviews that say its bad because its a brown hugh))) thats the way its suppose to look.,1
"I had been stalking All Tied Up for MONTHS - since it was/is a 2012 Summer Collection color it was SO hard to find locally.  I found it on Amazon - value priced and with shipping less than retail and tax!!  Bought 2.  Color is amazing! A salmon peach with a hint of gold.  Shipping was fast too!  Love, Love, Love my new (2013) summer color!!",1
rubbed in clear and not chalky,1
I love this sunscreen! I wear it everyday under my make up. It doesn't make my skin feel caked like most sunscreens do. (I have oily skin and live in the ultra humid south.) My make up goes on smoothly over it as well. And it doesn't contains harmful ingredients. Double bonus!!,1
"I have used Toppik hair building fiber for over a year. To a large extent, it has worked for me. I sprinkle it over a large portion of my head to merge with my existing hair. This product has fine fibers which works best for me when I trim my hair very low before I use it. In this way, my short natural hair fibers match perfectly well. Though, I have not been able to match the color exactly to that of my natural hair color. Dark brown is closest, though I would prefer something darker. Black is the next, but it is too dark for my hair. Fortunately, the brown darkens after two days of application, to harmonize. I must say that, once I use the product, it stays on for three to five days, then I wash it off with shampoo and re apply.
Oh, I do not like the fact that the container is opaque. It makes it very hard for one to know when one is running out. Better to order a replacement in advance.

It is advisable to always keep a cap/hat or some of the product as a back up, Just in case. Some fiber spray-holders do not hold firmly enough, in which case, any object touching your head can easily brush of the fiber. Thicker Fuller Hair spray will be my recommendation for a firmer hold. However, I am told that the product can only be shipped by land, thus, it takes much longer to ship to a far away destination.

"I have been using this cream day and night for 20 days now.
At first I figured that nothing would change but that at the very least I would have a moisturized face.
My opinion has changed.  I actually do see a difference!

At about day 13 I realized that my skin looked different.  It looks more refined, smoother if you will.  My face has an over-all fresher, not so dry and tired look.  My makeup goes on easier and looks better as well.
I am not one to say something works when it does not and am pretty skeptical overall.  So, I really mean it when I say that this is working on me.

This cream has a scent that is fresh, slightly citric and reminds me of going to a spa.  I enjoy putting the cream on because of the light scent.  I will note again that I am not typically a person that would like scented cream.  I love the smell of this.

You can read all of the ingredients from the pictures and all of the claims for this extreme cream in the notes already posted.

I surely can't tell if the cream has a defense from environmental factors or if it is actually strengthening my skin.  I can say that is smells great and has made a difference in my skin texture and moisture level.  Maybe over the long term I will see my fine lines diminish as it claims...

I read some reviews saying that the cream irritated their skin.  So I looked up StriVectin products and they suggest trying their creams every other or every 3rd day if you only have a mild irritation.  Maybe that would help.
I have an issue with the cost of this product.  At 90 bucks for 1 oz, many people can't afford this.  If it is possible it would be great if the price could be lowered since it only last about 6 months.",1
"I have heard all the hype about the Clarisonic cleansing brushes, but I did not want to shell out $100+ for a tool to wash my face. When I got the opportunity to review this product, which is a less-expensive copycat of the Clarisonic, I decided to give it a try. First of all, be aware that you have to charge this for 24 hours before using. In actuality, the blinking ""charge"" lights went out after about 12 hours, so it was probably fine then but I gave it the full 24 to be fair. It's not intuitive how to connect the charger (it's magnetic), so I had to read the instructions. It's probably a good thing that I read them because there is a warning not to unplug the charger before disconnecting it from the brush, because the battery can discharge and then you would have to start over again. When I finally got to use this product, I was not impressed at all. The brush is very soft (a good thing) but it vibrates (as opposed to spinning) and it just made my head vibrate and feel uncomfortable. It actually felt like a mild electric shock. There is a vibrating timer on the brush that tells you to move to a new area, but based on this timing it would take about 45 minutes to wash my entire face. When I moved the brush to my nose, I felt actual pain (I broke my nose a few years ago and had a surgical repair, but have never felt pain after the initial healing until I used this brush). I tried to give it to my teenage daughter, but she has sensitive, acne-prone skin and didn't want to risk using this product. Maybe I'll use it to clean my shower.",0
makes hair feel greasy if applied when wet,1
Nice mask...for sensitive skin.,1
"This is the best smelling hair product I've ever used in my life. I originally had a trial size I tried out a few times and then realized how much I liked it, so bought the full-size. It definitely nourishes hair but does not feel greasy on 2nd-3rd day hair - the hair fully absorbs it, I guess. It only takes a little bit, so I'm hoping the bottle will last a very long time and make the expense worth it. :)",1
"My face feels incredible after I use this.  I am in Afghanistan where the weather is bad on your skin, so I use this along with the Revision spf50 cream and love it.",1
"Can't beat this product!  Even over high end brands at twice the price.  I have used it for over 30 years.  But just switched to the wearable styling a year ago.  Conditions better than Purology.  I have curly hair so I like the wearable styling feature.  When I straightened my hair, colored it and/or permed it, it was the only product out of the dozens I tried that kept my hair from feeling like straw.",1
"After doing some research on Amazon I decided to ask for this curling iron for Christmas on my amazon list. My sister got it for me. I used it 4 times. The second time, on the lowest setting, it FRIED my hair. It is truly frizzled/fried in places, which is very distressing. After talking to my stylist and buying some heat protective spray, I tried it again. It seemed OK for 2 more uses, then stopped working entirely. The power indicator light goes on, but it does not heat up AT ALL. This happened right before an important professional meeting I had to travel to, which I had to attend with flat hair.

Re-reading the reviews I see that other people have had a similar if not identical experience. It is probably the worst product I've ever gotten. And I can't return it because it was a present plus I threw away the packaging. I recommend that you AVOID THIS PRODUCT. I will never buy a ""Hot Tools"" product again.",0
"I have been using Nectifirm for several years, and it is a great product.  However the contents of this particular jar were very thick and darker in color.  And unfortunately it doesn't work either.  I will be ordering from a different supplier since I'm guessing it was either an old or inauthentic product.",0
"way too hard - would work well for shower detangling, but not comfortable as a head massager.",0
"For me personally, the liquid formula for the light brown matches my hair color a lot better than the dry formula. It covers all of my bald spots and you can't tell it's there unless you look really close. The only complaint I have is that it sometimes tints the sweat on the back of my neck and gets on my fingers when I adjust my hair. Other than that, it's a life saver.",1
"Personal preference, but these were a poor purchase. The texture of the cream is awful, like 3 times thicker than toothpaste, and tough to apply. Leaves the skin kind of greasy. Very disappointed.",0
Love this powder but one was broken when I received it.,1
"This mascara goes on light for a more natural look.  However, it  did cause slight irritation - mainly itchiness.  It didn't irritate me as much as other mascaras, but I did experience itchiness the day I used it and the day after.  Since my eyes are so sensitive, my low rating was also based on the following short comings

- It doesn't apply smoothly.  It goes on with small clumps as if the mascara was dried out.
- It smears.  By the end of the day I had dark circles under my eyes from the mascara smearing.

I wouldn't recommend this product even if your eyes aren't really sensitive.  The smearing is a nuisance and the little clumps when applying are a pain to remove.",0
"Item is on the heavy side compared to the cheaper models but the fan is much mor epowerful and quieter.  However, 2 months into my purchase, the fan started to make a loud wheezing sound and you can smell something burnt in the hair dryer.  There are no dirt or lint trapped at the air intake at the end so it is not the cause of the burnt smell.  This is the more expensive hair dryer I purchased and I am very disappointed.",0
"They don't do the job, have tried all the ""tips & tricks"" for these and nothing has worked. They also smell HORRIBLE.",0
I purchased this because of the positive reviews but I would not recommend this product. My hair is very long and wavy and this left my hair dry and dull looking with more split ends than I have ever had in my life.,0
"If you are sensitive to smell, you may want to find a trial offer of this before buying it.  After all, it's applied a few inches under the nose, and they use a large amount of perfume.  It gave me an immediate headache so I'll never know if it's effective for my sagging neck.  I'm not sure why they use any perfume at all.  It definitely would cancel out any perfume or cologne I would choose to use, and it doesn't make their product work better on tightening the skin.",0
"You get a lot of shave cream for the price. If you shave everyday, like me, it will probably 4-5 months. I also have a very tough beard. It's good, does the job. I'd advise using preshave cream first then this one - although the preshave really smells like Vicks from the menthol. This has menthol too I think but probably less but your face will feel cold and probably smells like menthol. Since I used both I couldn't really tell the degree. Also after you put it on I'd advise patting warm water on that area before shaving it, area by area. It says leave it on 2 minutes then shave so good idea to do that. I gave it 4 stars because it is good and effective, but it didn't blow anything out of the water. I didn't really deduct anything for the menthol since that is only a preference thing. Really myself, I don't really like the menthol as a daily shaver but I will probably use 1-2 times a week. I guess Italians really prefer the menthol. I'd also say this is more like a semi solid sort of thing because you lather it and it becomes like a cream. You can also use your hand rather than a shaving brush. It's not a like a gel though. Very good since never had good shaves with gels.",1
"Not as pigmented as I'd hoped, and WAY greasy. Pretty colors in the case though.",0
If you have a problem with dry hands or hangnails this is the cream I have ever used. It is expensive but well worth the rice.,1
"Blows so lightly, takes forever to dry your hair",0
"While I think this product is ok, what I find really frustrating is the misleading packaging. If you pull off the top, you will find you did not buy a bottle of lotion but instead a tiny bag that is stuffed inside the bottle & contains an infinitesimal amount. I find this purposefully misleading & because of this, I won't buy it again. Skip this lotion & just buy a good sunscreen instead for 1/2 the price. Or a good moisturizer from Kiehls & a cheaper sunscreen for the price of this lotion. This product is simply not worth the price.",0
"So not worth the money! Made my hair look super dry, especially on the ends. Also, I was not able to return it due to ""special shipping"" reasons.",0
Arrived safely,0
so bad,0
it worked out well for me .The best thing I can say is that it is amazing :)))),1
"I gave this product a four star for several reasons.

Iron heats up in less than a minute.
It gets the job done in one try.
Cools down pretty quickly.

I do not like the fact that it gets so hot it burns my fingers. Makes it difficult to hold. Overall the product seems to be good. I may update my review after  a months or so.",1
"Because I have sensitive skin, I have difficulty finding cleansing products that won't irritate my skin. Thought I had found a solution with DDF Sensitive Skin Cleansing Gel. Nope. Nada. Nyet. After a couple of days the skin in my trouble areas started peeling right off, actually worse than with other products. For a product that advertises for sensitive skin and at the price charged, NO WAY, HOSEA!! So what do I do with a full container of this stuff?",0
"Beware this is not the real stuff! Daughter couldn't get to the supply house to buy the real deal. This bottle is all black print. The picture shows the real bottle. I do have a bottle of the real Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine and I compared the ingredients and they are not the same!
This is a lot of money for FAKE Paul Mitchell!
And to top it off, this item is not returnable!
WISH I COULD GIVE THIS A ZERO STAR!",0
great stuff,1
"Streaky, but convenient.  Wouldn't purchase again.",0
"My thick, long, wavy Asian hair was just as frizzy as it was before using this.",0
i love this powder. it covers redness fairly well. i have very sensitive skin and the only products that i'm able to use are dr. hauscka and jane iredale. excellent coverage.,1
Been using for a long time. Highly recommend!,1
i couldn't get the pump to work,0
"The lotion applies nicely, doesn't sting or smell bad or overwhelmingly perfumed.  The amount in the tube is a fair amount, but unfortunately I'm trying it on a very large area and am just about out, well short of the 8 weeks in which I should see any results that I'm looking for.  I am sure if I was using this just on my face I'd have plenty left to keep using.

Packaging spells out when to expect to see results, how often to apply to get the best results, etc.  I think it's been helping so I'll probably be reordering soon.  Price is better here than most other online retailers.",1
"These Archipelago candles are amazing~ powerful, long-lasting fragrances that fill the room like incense and stay for hours.  My husband and I like Havana the best~ it has a masculine, old-world feel.  The candles last a long time and are high quality and burn clean.",1

"this product is easy to use and is great for wavy/curly hair. it holds well without giving the ""wet"" look",1
"I have tried several La Roche-Posay products.  They are a good brand. This concealer is no exception.

Color:
I tried both the light beige and yellow beige. I tried 2 tones because I was afraid the light beige might have a rose undertone, which looks bad on me.  Lucky, the light beige is a neutral beige, and just the right shade for my fair skin.  I think the yellow beige would look better on light olive or Asian skin tones. The yellow beige still goes on okay for me, if I put it on under foundation, but it takes longer to blend in and not as seamless a color for me.

Coverage:
I gave this product 4 stars because how well it conceals depends on what you are trying to cover.  I have a few acne spots that are slowly fading from breakouts.  Using this product, I can conceal light spots with 1 coat.  I can conceal medium dark spots with 2 coats and a layer of foundation.  The concealer doesn't work as well on dark spots. Some dark spots don't stay concealed for very long, even with a few layers of concealer and foundation, so I have to re-apply later in the day.

Conclusion:
So although I find this product useful, I'm not sure I will automatically buy another one in the future. The La Roche-Posay foundation that I use, which I give 5 stars, does a good job on its own, except when I have dark spots. This product has a limited effect on dark spots, so I might try other concealers before buying this one in the future.  That being said many concealers have the same issues as this one with dark spots, so that's why I still might consider this in the future, and gave it a high rating..",1
Love it. Great shave going back to old school,1
"feels good and natural, very light, and helps make your hair look silky smooth. I also use things that can dry out my hair - this helps eliminate that dry damaged look!",1
Too small,0
"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1
Great smelling purfume. Doesn't stay on you for more then a little bit. Pretty bummed about it....,0
"no problems, received what I expected",1
These things are junk no matter where you buy them from. My girlfriend bought one at Macys for $180 and it quit working after 2 weeks for no apperant reason. I suggested she buy one on Amazon because they are cheaper. It lasted 4 days. I figured I could figure out the problem and fix it so it doesnt break because she really likes them but they are sealed up and must be basically broken into to get inside them. Just another piece of junk thats designed to fail so you have to buy another,0
Junk sample stuffs. Not worth the money,0
"Smells great, though I feel this may be most effective with short (2 inches or less) hair.",1
Not impressed product broke right in half! I expect to receive another one! Waiting for seller to reply.,0
I bought one 20 years ago and it finally died.  Just purchase I he Mia2 and love it more than my first Clarisonic.  Love the brush head that came with it too.  This device has kept my skin smooth and blemish free for years.  Every women she have one.,1
The rollers do not stay in place with the pins supplied... they keep falling out. The clips leave ridges in the hair. Too much money for a poorly designed hot roller.,0
This product did not work for me as caused more breakouts.  I was looking for a less inexpensive face wash compared to R&F products but this one did not seem to cleanse as advertised. Very disappointed with results. I threw away over half the bottle and have since gone with a Tea Tree Oil based face wash which seems to have worked much better.,0
"This hair dryer works wonderful for what I bought it for.  It's lightweight, keeps the frizz down in my thick unruely hair, and has shortened my drying time.  But I don't think it has cut my dry time in half like some folks have said.  My old hair dryer was a Conair so this is a major improvement and I am still very happy with this purchase.  I would buy this again and again, especially at the great price Amazon is offering.",1
did a really nice job on my hair.,1
Nail polish peeled right off within hours this was a waste of money,0
I didn't want anything blue for my gray hair and this was and did give my hair a blue gray look,0
Fabulous eyeliner.  Goes on easy and stays on all day.  Kind of a sparkly black.,1
I was so excited to order this. The reviews were great for it and I figured with it being so expensive it must work for that price. I got it in the mail and watched the movie that comes with it and read the manual. When I went to use it the flash didn't show with it when it zaps and then every 5th zap exactly it would have an error light come on and I'd have to restart it. I'm fair skinned and have dark hair so there is no reason it shouldn't work. I tried to call their help number and couldn't get ahold of anyone. Then I emailed them and got a message that they will get back to me in 24 hours and they never did. I emailed them again and never heard back. I'm returning it this week. If the machine works that would be great but the customer service is awful so if yours comes broken you are SOL.,0
Very nice.,1
Did not heal my cracked lips at all! Im not satisfied! This product is very greasy...and Im not sure if this is the original.,0

Excellent,1
"The best way to make these strips work is to hold it in front of a small space heater for about 20 seconds then, seperate the strips and apply to your leg, rub it in for about 10 seconds, then rip.  When the wax feels like its hardening a little, hold infront of the space heater again for about 10 seconds then repeat step 2.  If you use this method you should be able to do both legs (excluding thighs) with about 3 double sided strips.  It works well enough for my legs.",1
The lotion was separated with oil and clearly old or damaged. I have used this in the past and have never experienced receiving an old product or a fake one.,0

"I really wanted to like this because it serves a similar purpose as Biore but is cheaper. Unfortunately, I HATED it. Not only was it ineffective at cleaning pores, it horribly stains anything it touches. In terms of efficacy, it has the pore cleaning power of about 10% of Biore. It was pretty much like spreading black Elmer's Glue on your face, letting it dry and peeling it off. I accidentally got it on a shirt and a new pair of True Religion jeans. I tried to rinse it while it was wet and that didn't work. So on the other item, I let it try and tried to peel it off, and that was worse. I ruined about $400 worth of clothes testing this product. Don't make the same mistake.",0
A great clear gel.  Lets me see my beard and stash when fine tuning with a razor.,1
"This product is the BEST!! I have sensitive skin, which has been scarred by acne. While I no longer breakout, I still have the unsightly scars. Well, I did, until I began using these pads once a day. They not only make your skin feel smooth as butter, they've managed to get rid of my dark marks far faster than using the expensive department store products.

Some people on here say that it's made their pores smaller. This hasn't been my experience. My pores aren't larger, they just aren't any smaller. Perhaps, I should start using the pads less? I have sensitive skin and over exfoliation can make your pores inflamed, which make them larger.

This treatment will burn a bit upon initial application after you've been using it for awhile. It's only temporary. If you don't feel as though you can handle the tingle, don't use the pads everyday.

***KEEP AWAY FROM YOUR EYES*** I read someone say that it made their wrinkles/fine lines fade... I rubbed a pad on my under eye area for 2 days and by the third, I had a NEW fold under my eyes! I'm in my twenties and only had 1 barely visible line before. I stopped using it under my eyes  and about 4 days later, my eye area was normal again. Glycolix Elite makes products for your eyes and if you're actually having wrinkle issues, I'd suggest those as this product is too strong to be used on your sensitive eye area... especially if you already have sensitive skin like moi.

Using these pads have given me so much confidence that I don't have to fret about slathering on concealer and foundation before being seen in public! They've also saving me the expense of going to the dermatologist to have laser treatments on my face and neck to remove those spots.

When I first started using the pads, I used them twice a day (mornings and nights) for about 5 days. Then, 2x a day was unbearable and I changed to only applying at night, before bed.

I deducted a star because this is my 3rd jar of these pads and I cannot seem to figure out a way to keep them from getting mold/mildew on the inner cap. They remain upright in a dry cabinet, yet the cardboard liner in the jar's lid soaks up the product on the pads. I tried to resolve this issue by cutting a piece of foil and inserting it in the cap, but that's when the mildew came. I had all of the ""treatment"" still in my pads, but a cap with mildew. Eww.",1
I buy this cologne from macys... n try to give a chance with amazon.....but fail..not the real...2 hour later not smell....never again...,0
Bought a few Zoya polishes because I don't like to use the crappy drugstore brands with all the chemicals in them. I like this brand. The color stays on longer than cheap brands and is safe.,1

"I went back to a double edge razor about a year or so ago, much to the delight of my face.  When doing so, I also figured I might treat myself to this shaving soap... yeah soap, you need to have a brush to apply it.  However, some warm water, a good brush and a clean face does a happy man make... Good base for a gliding razor. (I have an Edwin Jaegger razor, British, bought here on the Big A). Clean, close, smooth shave... brings fun back to shaving again... I have a light beard, and I can be clean shaven in about 3 minutes... from the time I appply the soap to the time I towel my face... quick, easy, clean... ain't that the way it is supposed to be...?  BTW, my Lady really likes the smell of the soap, another plus if you ask me.,",1
Have seen an improvement in my hair.  Love the smell.,1
I have an itchy scalp due to allergies and this shampoo is a lifesaver!  The smell isn't too strong and it isn't a harsh shampoo for my color-treated hair. I recommend it for anyone with mild-moderate scalp issues.,1

Product was as described. I would purchase this product again.,1
I have sensitive and acne prone skin and it is great for mine!  So far I love it and haven't had as many breakouts and it is a little more moisturizing than the soap-free gel I was using prior.  I like it!!,1
This is a great silver in that it is conservative enough for work and fun for more casual settings or events. It is not super shiny or glittery. It works more like a neutral.,1
"Overall, I liked this product. The quality is very good, easy to apply, and it lasts. I absolutely loved the lip colors, and the 3 lighter eye shadow colors. However, the blush is very, very dark, but it does blend very well so it's not so cartoonish as when first applied. Couple of the eye shades were extremely dark (black!). I imagine this would be great for the old smokey eye look, but I don't do that. If you like a natural look, this is probably not the product for you. The applicator is decent, but it does not include a larger brush for cheeks. Also, there is no way to attack the applicator brush, so it makes it not quite as portable as you would think. Overall, this is an excellent product with gorgeous, shimmery colors perfect for the holidays or other special occasions.",1

"I highly recommend La Roche-Posay Anthelios 60 for anyone wanting extremely reliable facial sunscreen.  I've been using this product for a few years now, but just recently went to Mexico and used it everyday.  One single application in the morning provided me with amazing all day coverage through sweat, water, wind.  I put SPF 50 on my body (of another brand) and I burned, even after reapplying several times during the day.  So I give this product 5 stars.  My dermatologist recommended this product.  It does not sting or smell funny; it leaves a satin dry finish on your face.  No greasy feel or drippage in your eyes.  Awesome.",1

"I have been using Nail Envy for about 10 years. I think very highly of this product. I have extremely weak nails that peel to an uncomfortable degree of shortness unless I care for them scrupulously. With additional strength from Nail Envy, used as directed and as part of a comprehensive nail care plan, I have been able to maintain a nail length that is reasonably fashionable. My nail care plan also includes weekly hot oil manicures (which I do at home using warm-o-lotion heated in the microwave) and mineral supplements (calcium, silica and bee pollen).

I have projects several times a year that demand extra work with my hands (interior painting, intensive cleaning, gardening, etc)or lapses in my nail care routine which do sometimes set me back but returning to the routine has so far always restored decent nails within a week or two, depending on how much damaged I created. This stuff works for me.",1
Works very well,1
Ive been using this for a few weeks.  Im not really a fan.  The grit is WAY too large.  Ive used several other brands of face scrub.  Some have a lot of grit. . . . some not so much. . . but Ive never used one that had such large girt as this.  Its simply uncomfortable.,0

I finally opened it up and inside was a disgusting, gloppy, mess! It was thick, chunky, and separated. Tried to use it and it wouldn't even lather up. It was nothing like what I had bought before at Sephora. I had to throw it out. Total waste of money. I will only buy at Sephora or department store from now one. At least I can count on the quality of the product.",0

Do not like the smell at all!,0
"Blinc Mascara can be a great product if you know how to use it to get the look you want.

I wanted lush, thick, long, full lashes. Using Blinc by itself did not create that look for me. It does tend to look spiky, and that's a little too unnatural looking for some.

I will say that it is the best product to use for bottom lashes, because it doesn't smear or smudge, it gives you long, semi-spiky bottom lashes, and makes them DARK (if you use black).

Now about the top lashes. I wear contacts, so waterproof is the only way for me. I use THREE mascaras every morning to get the look, but it works! I curl my eyelashes, put on a light coat of a waterproof mascara with a plastic comb-on applicator. Wait for it to dry, put a coat of Blinc on top of it (yes, I know the tube says not to do that), wait for it to dry, and then coat it with another waterproof mascara on the tips with a stiffer plastic comb-on applicator. Of course I coat the bottom lashes with Blinc only.
I then have the long, semi-spiky, semi-lush fluttery lashes that I was looking for.
A lot of trouble? Maybe for some- but the coat of Blinc on my top and bottom lashes keep the mascara in place all day- and that's worth the trouble to me. The entire exercise only takes 15 minutes in the morning.

I recommend it for it's staying power and darkness, plus you can rub your eyelashes and you won't look all smeared and ""raccooned"".",1
"I liked the lipstick it was creamy.  It didn't make my lips as full as another lipstick that I used and got discontinued.  However, I would buy more lipstick from Elizabeth Arden.",1
I have used this sunscreen for years. It works perfectly under make-up.  Not at all greasy.,1
"The 1st Crabtree and Evelyn that I have not liked the smell at all. Smells just like soap. I pay for the scent as well as the effectiveness. Couldn't wait to get it in the mail. I just assumed being that brand, it would smell so good. Not so.

Well have used this daily since I received this since it was pricey. Even though the smell is still soapy the lotion actually works rather well. Pretty moisturizing.  It kind of exfoliates the skin as some of Crabtree an Evelyn skin quenchers.  I prefer the Pomegranate and Argan Oil.",1
Luv this. No more undue removal of lashes while curling them. It is a must-have item.  One should get them,1
"Great product when the can works. Much like other reviewers have said, the spray freezes or locks up tight and renders it useless. When one spends $16 on hairspray, one expects it will work. I won't waste my money on it anymore...too many experiences with this issue.",0
"I had same brand before, but it was smaller so it traveled really well. I wish it was smaller, but these are GREAT dryers...keeps the frizzes down!",1
"This is my second bottle of this tonic. The first I bought from my local salon, but this was priced much better. The product came well protected and wrapped (sometimes a problem with liquids). I use this on my second day after a shower to loosen up the Reuse wax I use the first day.",1
I love it.  Very easy to use and curls perfect.,1
Left my hair feeling discusting. It was also very hard to manage and made it extremely tangled. Only used it once then threw it away. Didn't work for me.,0
"This is just the perfect color, the perfect texture and it lasts all day long. I love this lipstick.",1
Such a rip off compared to what you actually get such a small bottle,0
Ok,1
"I alway like Mustela products as they are safe for babies and have a pleasant (not over-whelming scent).  I bought the Foam Shampoo as it was suggested that it could help with my daughter's cradle cap.  I have been using for a few weeks now.  It is a great shampoo, gentle for baby, but it hasn't cleared up the cradle cap issue.  I will continue to use but have looked elsewhere for a solution to that issue.",1
"I have fine hair and had hoped that if I used just a real, tiny amount it would be okay, but not so at all.  No amount of this is small enough for fine hair, period.  I gave my bottle to a girl at the office who has a full head of thick medium length hair, and she really likes it, said even her husband likes it on his super long beard.  So it's a good product, obviously, just have to have the hair for it, which I do not.  Thanks!",0
"It does leave a little residue in your hair, but the only one who can feel it is you. I love using this when my hair goes flat at the end of a work day and I need a quick work to night out touch up! Savior!",1
"Love it!!! Works awesome!!  Let it dry a bit before using this pen, but not completely dry.",1
works well,1
I've had this blow dryer for less than six months.....heating element is not working anymore and of course it's no longer eligible for return!!!,0
I wear my naturally coily hair (majority 4A) out. This product is great for those sections of my head that are more of the 3C/3B texture. A little goes a long way. It is great for the days I am just doing a wash and go and need extra moisture. Best part is that it works well with my other hair products. No residues!!,1
"This Gel/Paste does very well! If you are out in the Sun as I am and sweat or end up pouring water over your head to cool down, you can use your hand or hands to remove the excess water ""shake"" your head and then push you hair back into the shape you started with!",1
"I have typical combination skin with allergies to many chemicals and substances. I was looking for a very moisturizing gel what would make my skin look vibrant. Instead, the gel made me break out. Very strong fragrance. I am going to stick with a sensitive skin line like Avene.",0
"After my hair transplant the doctor explained me that my hair transplant wouldnt fall off. Ive been using Toppik since then and i have noticed that am losing my transplanted hair, I asked my doctor, Martin Behnke and he explained me the reason might be due to the usage of toppik and to stay away from any product that contains Ammonium Chloride and DMDM  he recommended me Hair Cubed and another product i don't recall the name but i have to say i don't have money its a little to expensive for me. So here am spending a fortune on hair transplant and to my luck a bottle of toppik cost me to lose nearly half of my expensive hair.",0
The gel is much too difficult to get out of this tube.,0
"Loved the smell and wanted to love it but it made my break out in my chin area and I started getting white bumps on my t-zone. I don't usually get acne but right now, I have 4 really painful ones clumped together on my chin and it hurts. Definitely not for me.",0
My sons favorite hair gel.  Keeps hair in place without looking to stiff or heavy.,1
At first I wasn't sure if I noticed a difference in my hair quality . But after the 2nd shampoo I felt my hair softening on the ends. Usually my hard water makes the ends of my curly hair stick straight and dry looking. My ends are curling now like they did before I lived with hard water .,1
Does what it's suppose to.,1
Not that great. Too creamy and not enough scrubbing.,0
I did not receive the mini. I received the regular one 1/2in.,0
"Been using this concealer for years and have tried others, but I keep coming back to this. Decent coverage that you can build. Best after applying eye cream as product doesn't blend as well in the eye area, thus minus one star. Great for covering up acne scars/freckles. Small jar lasts a LONG time.",1
best primer before the silicone makeup.  Goes on smoothly and feels soft and evens out skin tone.  It keeps the makeup on all day.,1
Does a good job in straightening my curly hair. My only complain is that it's a bit loud.,1
"Excellent product, especially for tinted hair that is blown dry and curled wih an iron.",1
Best stuff ever. It helps with my crazy frizzy hair!,1
"This mascara is flaky and more trouble than it's worth. This brand was recommended by the salon in which I got my eyelashes from, but I was not impressed.",0
"Uhm smell is okay but the previous Pomade that I use from American Crew is much better, Just trying something new.",1
"This brand lasts forever - my last curler lasted for multiple years before needing to buy a new one and I use it almost daily. I have paid for super expensive brands and always come back to this one since it handles well, lasts forever and is not too expensive. The 1 1/4 inch is the best!",1
Clean feeling,1
DID nothing to help my skin,0
Waste of money,0
"Not anything special, didn't feel or look good on skin. Left film. Didn't moisturize, clogged pores. Better off with drug store products. Don't buy.",0
"Seriously, there couldn't be a better sun cream for my face.
It is moisturizing and it's very light.
Plus, it smells nice.
I swear it makes my skin look and feel much better.",1
Works!!,1
"I bought this product hoping that it was the same thing I bought from my hair dresser, but I don't believe it was.  I never opened it because:

#1 The letters after the name wasn't TM like my old one, it was a R.
#2 The ingredients were different.  So i believed this product was a fake and I sent it back.

Check out the pictures and compare them yourself.",0
"If you need to cover up a tattoo, scar, blemish, DERMABLEND QUICK-FIX BODY FOUNDATION STICK FOR FULL COVERAGE, 10 SHADES, 0.42 FL OZ. really does the job. I was shocked at how quick and fully it covered my tattoo. I would recommend purchasing the setting powder as well.

great holding but very perfumie,1
i used it up religiously and the freckles on my face are the same. Waste of money. Bought mine at Sephora. I wish I could get my money back.,0
"This was absolutely NOT a true WEN product, which I have used for years.  Not even close.  Scent was non existent, it was greasy & appeared cloudy in the bottle which is not how this product should be. I THREW IT IN THE TRASH immediately.

I have learned my lesson & will not purchase from this Seller (hopefully they didn't have prior knowledge this was a knock off product) & only purchase directly from Wen.",0
I am not quite sure if this product has really done anything. It leaves a sticky residue on the scalp that I don't like. I was hoping after a month my hair would feel thicker at the hairline. (I was advised by my hair stylist to use this at the hairline only). My hair is not any worse but hard to tell if it is improved. I will continue to use until finished but probably would not purchase again.,0
I used this product for over 6 weeks and saw no difference in the length or thickness of my lashes. This was a waste of my money and I would not recommend this to anyone.,0
"Been using product for about a month for wrinkles around the eye. So far
it has not worked.  Better results with eleven dollar alpha hydrox products
and some Avon Anew products.  Waste of money.  Lotta hype.  Not even CLOSE
to botox.  Please.",0
"I bought this one for my wife. She was very pleased with it, but it lasted about 6 months - the plastic lever broke. I guess it was not intended for daily use... Perhaps it may be good for occasional use, to be kept in the purse.",0
"It works, but for the price you can do better. I bought Cremo at CVS for $8 for a huge tube and it wipes the floor with this stuff. I'd skip this.",0
"This product works very well as an all over body wash and even to shave my legs - Yes, I am a woman and I use this. I bought it for my husband, but he insisted on sticking with bar soap, so I am now using it. He'll come around......

The product does not have a strong odor of any kind, does not leave behind residue, does not dry my skin, does not require a lot for each shower yet it DOES leave my skin feeling clean and refreshed with no cloying fragrance to assault my senses all day.

I have not attempted to wash my hair with it. - I'll leave that up to the guys.

Why 4 stars and not 5? Expense. In my view all of the Jack Black products seem a bit expensive. However, of the several that I have tried, none of them require using copious amounts so each product seems to last a good, long time.

Also it would be unfortunate to see a company cut quality and content corners to make a specific price point on a beloved product such as this one.",1
I love this line. This lotions is light and creamy. Not greasy at all with a great smell.  Also great for sensitive skin like mine.,1
"Ive been using this product for years and finally decided Id buy it from Amazon instead of a salon. The product I received was NOT the same. It smells horrible, almost like an alcohol or sour sent, and it is not smoothing out or making my hair feel soft like it has in the past. If anything it makes it feel dry and frizzy. I 100% feel like what is in the bottle is not the real product.",0
I am allergic to this product.,0
Fast delivery. Thank you. The description says Ember is a fiery red. Swatches I saw on Pinterest shows a fiery red. What I received is a polish that is beautiful but is very Orange named Ember. Correct coding from the manufacturer so maybe I got a bad bottle. Sigh. Still beautiful.,1
"I love Jan Marini products. But, I now have a bottle that the pump does not dispense the product. How can I get this exchanged?",0
"I was in search of a less expensive dry shampoo & gave this one a shot. It smelled great but left a sticky residue on my hair akin to hairspray but somehow worse. Very disappointing, ended up buying the $30 I usually do!",0
"Such a petty, neutral color.",1
It's the only product I use. It also lasts quite awhile.,1
Love this product,1
"When it says smooth it definitely means it. The coverage is great, a small amount covers a large area. I have worn it for an entire day, and I don't think it stays on the entire time but I think it's still a good product. I got the color medium and at first it looked a little dark for my skin.  But over the summer I tanned a little bit but now its perfect.

I think the value is good, a little goes a long way.",1
The product does have a soothing feeling and non-greasy.  I have dark circles and hoped the product would reduce or eliminate them.  I didn't use it on a regular basis to notice how effective it was but I do believe the product is worth the purchase.,1
I have light hair so it does cover the bald spot completely but it does take the shine off some.,1
This was a dismal purchase.  My Purity by Philosophy works much better than this stuff.  Certainly wouldn't waste my money on it.,0
"Love this product.  I live where there is hard well water with lead in it & even with a filtration system, it did not keep my hair from turning coppery.  I heard of this product & it works fabulously!  My hair is soft, and if keeps the copper color at bay!  If only it worked on the gray...",1
I like this fragrance very much. It is a nice cherry blossom fragrance. Sweet but not overly so once it dries down. It reminds me of Diptyques Do Son except not as sweet and heavy.  I took off a star as it doesnt last as long as we would all like a fragrance to last:),1
"I really wanted to like this... I did tons of research on different products to help my skin. I am mid-30's.. Still suffer from acne, and also starting to get fine line and wrinkles.  I ordered this and the toner that goes with it.  I have been using the combo for about two months now and my skin has broken out way worse than it ever was before. I had been using Proactiv - I didn't see a big difference in my skin so I decided to try something more geared towards adults. Looking back on it, Proactiv didn't seem to make a huge difference in my skin, but at least it maintained it. Ever since I started using Effaclar, my skin has been oily and my face has broken out all over, even in places where I never had problems. I stuck with it, hoping it would get better. But after two months, I can't use this any longer :(",0
Good to use before moisturizer.,1
As a user of regular Blinc mascara I thought I'd give the amplified product a try. I won't buy this again. The formula is different and doesn't remove nicely like the original. Half way through the day it is flaked off. The brush is way too bulky and awkward as well. Guess I should stick with what I know works.,0
"Love this hair dryer! Professional quality, drys hair quick without damaging it.",1
this is a scam,0
"The new formula is really bad. It has a musky cheap men's cologne smell and leaves the skin feeling somewhat dry.  It also foams now, which can drip into your eyes when you apply the gel to your forehead and then use the Mia 2 on it.  I really don't know what they were thinking by altering the formula.  I really liked the old formula, from the way it worked to the way it smelled.  This stuff is just bad, save your money.",0
One of my favorite colors. Such a pretty blue,1
This is the absolute best - keeps hair shiny and hydrated.,1
"Product was delivered right on time and is great for keeping flyaways away.  Go light on the amount, though, or can make hair oily.",1
"Absolute garbage. I don't know who gives it good reviews. It smells horrid but thats still the best part. It leaves the hair dry and matte - takes away any natural shine you might have. Instead of bounce, your hair ends up in individual threads of dull, unhealthy looking hair. I do t know how this thing is still on the market. One of my worst purchases of any product ever.",0
"This curling iron has such a strong clamp and spring that your hair gets caught in it all the time, It  doesn't open all the way down so the hairs closest to the handle don't get released. I've tried using smaller sections of hair, but the same thing happens. The clamp part should be a little more tapered close to the handle. I hate it.",0
Although I am fine with this product it was not the actual Helen of Troy curling iron I was looking for. I was expecting for it to say that it was this on the box and be in a different package. It was brand new and does work well though.,1
I have purchased this on Amazon many times and it is sticky and a different consistency than the bottle purchased in store.  It is also a slightly different color. It makes my daughters' skin break out. They do not break out when I buy from the B&M stores.  Cannot recommend.,0
Terrible smell!,0
"Started using this product and within two days, my skin felt really bumpy like sand paper. Being that this is the first time I have used it, it could be that I have sensitive skin or have an allergy to an ingredient. Either way, it looks as though I will not be using it again. :(",0
"Okay....I would have given this a 5 star...product is excellent.  Easy to use, smooth, etc. However, I ordered another one (actually I did this twice now); I ""order this item again"" feature so you would think I would receive the exact same item.  Both items (because I did this twice) were labeled waterproof, but the writing on the last 2 items were ""gold"", the original was ""silver""...the last 2 were ""not"" waterproof; came off quickly and easily with plain water.  SO look at the one you receive and make sure it's waterproof",1
"I've been using this product for years, and it has made a tremendous difference in lessening the redness of my skin on
my face, neck and chest. (Sun damage from those teenage years before we were told the dangers of suntanning.)  This product
is worth the money.",1
"This item is received dead. Charged, but not turned on. Seems like a common issue on other version too, check white version, bad quality.",0
"The bottle of oil was not full, however the instructions said to pour the entire bottle of oil into the glass diffuser and the diffuser was totally full when the oil bottle was poured into it.  So it couldn't hold any more.

I have looked for a refill bottle of oil and cannot find it any where.

This scent smells very good.",1
"Seems to work well. I like the rosemary scent. It's hard to find comparable products, so it's worth it!",1
Works great!,1
"This cleaner helps clear my skin of makeup and dirt from the day.  It feels refreshing after I pat dry and I don't need to scrub on my skin to get the makeup and dirt removed.

I have pale skin, with mild breakouts, sensitive skin.",1
"A hairstylist recommended this flat iron and I am so happy I listened to her recommendation. Best Ive purchased and I have been through several , prices from lower end to higher end and this one hands down in my opinion is AWESOMMMEEEEE!!!",1
Made a great gift for a friends birthday! The color is beautiful! I would highly reccommend this product to anyone.,1
"This is a great product. I am a huge user of various mattifiers and primers to keep shine away from my incredibly oily skin. I have used many  brands - Dr Brandt, Ole Henriksen, Dermablend, Biotherm Homme etc. Oily skin can never be 100% shine-free, but this product allows skin to come close to shine-free. It is not very lightweight though - I can feel there is something on my face after application, but it definitely does a good job of mattifying.",1
"I did not LIKE this AT ALL. The texture is terrible, it feels like bad product or cheep product. I have the shampoo and I LOVE IT, but this was not good to say the least. I felt like someone replaced the product with something cheep.",0
"LOVE IT. Perfect size for the travel kit and the gym. And the bag is very nicely put together, sturdy and classic.",1
I've used the less expensive hot tools products and they seem to work better.,0
"This is a great polish. It's a red jelly-cream (mostly jelly) which makes it super shiny. & it's more cool-toned, which tends to be universally flattering. I love it & I feel like it's a perfect red to wear anytime of year.",1
"Sent the first one back because the bars do not fully close as I have seen other complain of.  The second one was just like the first.  However it is just a slight opening and when in use still clamps on my hair very well and the hot heat I have found it to be productive so not returning again, I will continue to use.
UPDATE: a year and a half now and the straightener has completely stop working will not heat up at all now.  Paid too much money for it to only last 18 months.",0
"So I was using this shaving cream and absolutely loved it. It lathers well and smells good but I recently found out that it is not paraben free. For those who don't know what parabens are can look it up here [...]
I would like to be on the safe side.",0
Smells nice but does not give a good shave. Was left with shaving rash and bumps. Used all my normal razors that work fine with other creams. Will not repurchase.,0
"Yes, Purology is more expensive than other brands, but it lasts so long - almost 6 months - and works so well -  very few Bad Hair Days  -  that the cost is more than justified.

This product is especially helpful if your hair has been colored or highlighted, if it's on the dry side (or if the winter weather has made it so), or if you have combo hair (dry hair but oily scalp).

Finally, this $40 size bottle is a huge savings value.  You get 4 times the ounces of the $20 bottle, but at only 2 times the cost. and you won't need to purchase again for almost 6 months.  Definitely an excellent product!",1
This cream is very dense and therefore has a better chance at seeing results. I tried a sample before I purchased the 1.7 oz jar. I believe it reduces the center of the neck. I took before and after pics. It is working.,1
"Immediately opening the jar I thought, ""this smells like perm/relaxer"" I also thought it would be thick liquid consistency like the neutralizer. I have a chin length bob 4a/b/c, and I bought the normal/tinted because I know I still have a bit of bleach under a dark rinse on my ends, but I was concerned this strength wouldn't take. I clarified, used a Design Essentials leave in I had on hand, and did a quick blow out. I started in the back where the curl is the tightest and worked my way to the front where I have some ""heat trained"" strands in the front. It took me about 30 minutes to fully distribute, using my fingers to smooth and keep straight, and based on a review I'd read let it sit another 30 minutes. I did take combs of various widths and manipulate the curl pattern for the back and at my roots the last 10 minutes.  Unlike a regular relaxer there is no burn, but the hair also doesn't visibly smooth as readily with the comb thru.  I did the knot test, which stayed closed.  After rinsing I applied leave-in as suggested - I'm sure these steps are just to smooth the cuticle and make detangling easier - they don't affect the process so buying their brand products is moot.  Another quick blow out with flat brush, hair seemed a bit smoother, like if I had added heat protectant.  Used my Babyliss ceramic tourmaline iron on 450 and did maybe 2-3 passes per section. Hair was uber straight and had a nice natural shine. Neutralized for 10 minutes, hair didn't stay poker straight wet primarily at the root area but definitely way straighter than at the shampoo stage or rinsing the relaxer stage.  Did a Roux Porosity treatment, followed bya moisturizing deep condition, then a spray leave-in.  Applied no heat protectors or glosses and did the final quick blow dry with the flat brush was super easy - very noticeable improvement in time. My hair is very straight, bouncy, its 90+ degrees this week and I live on the Ohio River so this is the test. I feel I may have to go in and spot straighten in a couple weeks at my roots down 1-2 inches but we'll make the determination before the month ends.",1
Not seeing results. Have used it religiously for 2 months now....,0
I ordered this for my mom and she really loves it. She never leaves the house without applying this to her face and neck.,1
Great razor. Had the butter fly open ones in the past but they stopped opening up after a few months. This 3 piece design is GREAT. YOU WILL LOVE IT.,1
"This product was nota true Image product.  The product was not sealed and is extremely oily.  I would suggest - "" Do not purchase skin products in line.""",0
"Leaves a sticky residue making hair feel dirty, but holds fairly well.",1
"PROBABLY FAKE.
FIRST REVIEW IS LEFT UP BECAUSE DRYER SEEMED TO WORK FOR A SHORT TIME. SEE REST OF REVIEW BELOW
bought for wife, she has shoulder length, thick, color treated and naturally curly hair that she diffuses or air dries in the hot weather. she had gone through three blow dryers recently, two revlon and one i cant remember, but its one you can buy at the big box store. one blew upin her hand, and one, the ions stopped working ( hair wasn't getting smooth anymore). she  also doesnt blow dry every day.. 3, sometimes 4 times a week. anyway she had been looking for a better one, and while the revlon ones have tons of reviews, lots of people left bad reviews. so she began looking for a babyliss, settled on this one, and while its the most expensive we have gotten, its proved the best. her nporma routine was blow dry, velcro rollers to dry and set hair the rest of way, and some flat ironing on the ends. since using the new dryer, she no longer has to use to rollers or even the flat iron, her hair looks great and is very soft to the touch and shiny as well. highly recommend this one. worth the $$$

EDIT 3/16/16
So very shortly after writing te above review, the dryer stopped working. Not totally, but it began taking FOREVER to dry anyone's hair, even our 18 month old son, who has fine hair. The hot now burns your scalp, and medium is cold, like the cool setting. This dryer is now working as well as the the one we were using prior to the Babyliss, and it was on its last legs, taking forever to dry hair. This dryer stopped making hair soft and smooth after about the 3rd usage. We asked for a replacement and it got ere today, but we haven't even opened the box yet. We contacted Babyliss through their Facebook page, an they informed us that only authorized retailers offer real Babyliss products. We are going to call customer service line tomorrow morning, they said they would be able to tell us if the items we received are authentic. They also said no seller on Amazon is an authorized seller for their products.",0
Yet to see the difference though,1
"NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN!!! I used this product exactly as directed, it went on smooth and felt fine until I washed it off. My entire face was bright red with a mild chemical burn. My skin isn't even that sensitive normally, but this stuff is way too harsh! Absolutely do not recommend for even the least bit sensitive skin!",0
"Bottle was not sealed well, half of the contents leaked out.",0
"Good shampoo + conditioner I use it daily. It also lathers up very well, a little but of this stuff goes a long way.",1
When I ordered these I thought they were the same brand that I usually get but they are not!  They don't cut well and the mechanism that makes them ultra-thin makes them difficult to use.  Don't waste your money.  I recommend the Dovo Flat Nail Clipper.,0
Smells like cupcakes and makes my hair so easy to comb after showering! I get the larger size and it lasts over 6 months so it's definitely worth the money! I recxomebd using it with the milkshake color care shampoo and conditioner but it still works great with other products too!,1
"After having bought this product while cruising, It should have had a rich & soothing aroma.  I was disappointed when it came in the mail, because, it had no scent whatsoever.  I think it was either stale or diluted.  I will not purchase any scented items like this again from Amazon.",0
"My hairdresser turned me on to this stuff. She applies it by rubbing it between her palms and then clapping her hands over my hair. Feathery strands fall like dust, and then she works it in. When I apply it, I skip the clapping part and just run my fingers through my hair. It's a perfect balance of hold without being sticky and stiff. I have short, stick-straight hair, and this product gives me a nice tousled look. It doesn't last all day necessarily, but I've never found a product that did.",1
My wife used this cream on her face and hands. She liked it as a good product. This product arrived right on time.,1
Does not last very long; wears off in a couple of hours,1
"I typically love davines products and I was a bit disappointed in this one. As many of the reviews stated- it has a strange (smells like plastic). Also, there's no difference in my hair.",0
"I am very, very disappointed with this mascara, having been so excited to find one in a deep plum color that I'd been looking for. The brush is ok, but the color is all but non-existent. It is supposed to ""coat your eyelashes in color tubes, making them appear longer and fuller"". The tube part of that is true, but the rest of it is nothing but hype. It was also **EXTREMELY** difficult to take off. This was $20 seriously wasted.

The vendor did, however, ship in a timely manner and I received the product quickly. Kudos to vendor, but I'm very disappointed with the product.",0
I got a free sample of this and after putting it on I spent all day wondering what that smell was. Finally I placed it: a gas station bathroom air freshener. Yuck.,0
"I am very disappointed in this line! I thought perhaps once that what was written could be true. Alas, no! The part of the line I bought is still too perfumey! I have chemical sensitivity & cannot use any personal care products with perfume/fragrance added. I also have regular allergies so cannot tolerate herbal additives with smells.  Also nothing with formaldeyde (& in it's sneaky various names used!). Disappointed.",0
"Pros:
Pretty bottle

Cons:
It didn't matter how little I applied,  it always made my hair look and feel greasy. Hated this. I don't even have greasy hair,  it is dry due to years of being blonde back in the day,  yet this managed to grease it all up and it was difficult to wash out",0
"I'm rating it a 4 because the polish does not stick to my nails for long. Within days the polish begins to chip off my nails. If this polish is salon quality, I must be doing something wrong maybe? I use the base coat, color coat and finish off with 2 top coats. My nails ALWAYS come out beautiful and I get compliments all the time. I'm just not too happy with the many times I have to go back and fix my nails.",1
Difficult to obtain even medium coverage when I used this product. Did not stay on more than a few hours.,0
"While the color blended well, I found this concealer to be very drying.  It also went on sort of chalky and sat in fine lines.  It didn't work for me, but might for others.",0
"I was not very happy, this item was not sealed or boxed which made me feel as if it were used. It also had leaked all over the inside of the package wasting the product. Very disappointing.  :(",0
Heard all these raves about this brand. I didn't care for it. I want dray shampoo that after using I can pull my fingers thru my hair. This was like a hairspray where it pulls & tugs to get thru.,0
"My hair is definitely much shinier and less frizzy huge BONUS. I feel like it is a little weighed down. Which in some ways helps with the humidity and puffy hair-but isn't as good as the days pass and it can look stringy. Overall I would recommend it to someone to try. I have only washed my hair twice with it. I do think it's making my hair softer and adding shine more than any other shampoo alone, so it's really good not perfect. I will see how it works with my hair over time.",1
"I like this LORAC palette.  I carry it in my makeup bag for quick touch ups if needed during the day.  It has everything; blush, bronzer, eye shadows and highlighter.  The eye shadows require a light touch as is true with all LORAC eye shadows.",1
"I do not like heavy makeup.  This is perfect!  Just a tiny dab brightens you face.  My daughter wears makeup and uses it over her makeup. So either way it's the best! I have been useing it for years, the seller is excellant as well. Buy it!",1
Excellent hand cream that lasts through most of the day. But careful not to use too much at once--makes the hands a bit sticky. The only downside is the icky fake floral smell.,1
Love this product BUT I got a defective bottle.  It doesn't spray ... instead its leaking and makes a freaking mess.  Such a shame as its expensive and I love the product as I use it all the time ... I just won't every buy from this merchant again the product.,0
I've been using this product for the last year or so after one friend recommended it. I have not changed products sense. This washes your face with ease and efficiency. It leaves your face smooth and without dryness or flaking. I could not say enough good things about this product. Highly recommended!,1
Got my lipstick today. And the lipstick its self was broken off in the lipstick lid...kinda disappointed....,0
Love this stuff.  Works great w/ heat.,1
"Terrible performance, peels off after 2 days.",0
"I love Onesta Playpaste. I have used it for about 3 years. I have ordered it online through several distributors via Amazon; this particular one I bought is ""hard."" The paste is hard, not the usual texture and quite frankly, sub par. This is not Play Paste as it is, or it's a very old product. Unhappy.",0
"I bought some of this stuff as an experiment and honestly I can't believe people use this crap.

This is fake hair powder that looks like fake hair powder and you aren't fooling anyone.

If you're more comfortable walking around with this stuff in your hair than you are being bald you have serious daddy issues.

Shave your head. Grow a beard. Get into shape. Get on with your life.",0
"All hail ""All Hail The Queen/McQueen"", it seems. I've heard nothing but good things about this polish. But for me, it really hit flat. Especially considering the price.

For one, the tone isn't very flattering to most skin tones. I'm extremely fair with pink-toned Irish skin, and it just looks terrible. But I know women with more Asian skin tones who find it unflattering on their skin as well. I guess you have to be one of the lucky few to pull off this trendy polish without having hands of death going on.

Secondly, it's only holographic in very bright light. It's not quite holographic enough to be this super-special ""holographic"" nude that everyone talks about. Mostly, the holographic particles just come across as silver shimmer/glitter or something. It's disappointing.

Thirdly, this peels off my nails within a day. I've tried multiple base and top coats to try to lock it in place, but to no avail. And I don't really want to try this hard for a polish that doesn't look great on me anyway.

If you love it, great. I really wanted to. If you haven't gotten it, just beware of trends. Try to get it in a way that you can try it out in person or conveniently return it, because ""McQueen"" is a tricky SOB.",0
Product is fabulous for gel nails and I love the size.  It smells heavenly as well.,1
This product fit my hairdryer but does not stay on when you are using the dryer. It kept falling off.,0
"This is the best firming cream out there.  All plant extracts AND it has a wonderful, light scent.  I'll never buy anything else.",1
What a tacky little product for the price. Misrepresented to look larger than it is. I'm very disappointed.,0
Its all i ever use. I swim every week in a pool and go in the ocean weekly: and it really hepls my hair from drying out,1
"I have very light brows and this is a great product; easy to handle. Would like something a ""tad"" more taupe or ash in color but would consider ordering again. Used to use Maybelline gel brow product in taupe color before they discontinued it - go figure (so this is my basis of comparison).",1
I like this product. It's supposed to be less harsh on your nails and I think it does that very well and I like how it dispenses the nail polish remover. Very wash to use,1
not impressed with thw  results yet but giving it a good try before I give up,0
"Well I received it today and put it to the test. The razor comes with a single blade and the three pieces. I grew up using a DE safety razor and recently decided to go back after using an electric razor and the disposable razors for the past years. The weight and size felt great in my hand and on my face. The shave was great. No nicks, cuts, or irritation.  I gave it 4 Stars because it came with only a single blade, but Id recommend this razor.",1
"It's very difficult to use this shampoo because it is so liquid, it falls through your hands before you get it in your hair.  The bottle should be flexible so you can squeeze it directly onto your hair.",0
Fake. Neuma has great products and I've been using this shampoo for years but the one I just received from this seller is tampered product. Normally this shampoo has a very dark brown color (sap-like) but this was light yellow.,0
Not very satisfied with this curling iron.  The heat setting seems off and the curls don't stay.,0
"To expensive,  the product is good but the quantity to dollar value is ridiculous. They have good products similar to that for 1/3rd of the price",0
I was very disappointed. It made my skin peal. I used it twice and never used it again,0
love it,1
Liked it almost as good as the pearatin serum,1
I've given this product a couple of tries but have yet to see any results.  It is also irritating for sensitive skin.  I could not use it on a daily basis.  Will not continue to buy it.,0
"I was very skeptical but this had received good reviews.

I've been using it about every other day for a few weeks.  I'm 5'3"" 110#. I have cellulite on my legs. I work out regularly and eat well but there's only so much I can do before genetics and being middle-aged jumps in.

You need to use copious amounts of the cream with each use.  I think it lasted me about 7 uses.  I now use another cheaper brand of anti-cellulite cream or just regular thick moisturizer. If you don't have enough cream in the machine, it doesn't glide well.

I do one or two passes , in stripes going all around my legs.  Doing the back of my thighs it is almost impossible to keep my hand in the specific hand spot so I just hold the machine by the two sides. I use the constant setting ( worked my way up from the pulsing setting) and I have the suction almost all the way up. It is difficult to tell how far up the suction is since it is just a dial. It takes just a few minutes per leg.

I have definitely noticed a difference in the amount of cellulite on my legs.  I would say about 40% reduction. It's not a miracle worker but I think if you are someone who is otherwise fit and just has bad genes or stubborn areas this is for you.  I would imagine if you are not within your ideal BMI range you aren't going to get the results you desire. JMO.",1
"Used spot treatment incorrectly and burned my skin and caused rash.  Test on skin,use very small amount.",1
"Similar to other reviewers, I received a bottle that had been tampered with by the seller. The safety seal had been removed and reattached. The cap was lose and whatever green stuff was leaking out was assuredly not the original product.",0
"I've had cystic acne on my neck for about 10 years now. I tried this since it had high reviews, and like many others nothing worked (I even went to a dermatologist). I started using the buffering lotion a couple weeks ago, while my acne hasn't disappeared I do feel that it's brought the inflammation down significantly. I actually went out and bought the drying mask, cucumber lotion and aloe moisturizer I was so pleased. While it's not 100% gone, it's the only thing I've found that actually helps with inflammation and pain and seems to actually be doing something.",1
so far so good!,1
"Excellent product for providing volume to hair and reducing the need for other products, including hair spray.",1
"I was shedding more than usual from stress and decided to try this product. It made my hair feel and look great, but it also caused my hair to knot and then the knots/clumps would fall out. I thought it was part of my hair loss until I was traveling and did not bring this product with me. Sure enough, when I didn't use it, no knots and clumps. To be totally sure, when I got home I tried it one last time and it happened again. It must be because it is glue like. If you are having this problem while using this product, try stopping and see what happens.",0
"The most unhelpful product I ever ordered from Amazon.  The descriptions for the product ingredients are not as specific as they should be so one can't know what they are purchasing.  I ended up wasting $22 for a worthless product.  If you want lasting protection and no worries about putting more aluminum in/on your body, DO NOT buy this product!!!!",0
"I ordered this eye cream for both myself and my wife to use (I'll admit that I need it more than she does). We have not tried or even heard of this brand before. Honestly, these higher-end skin care creams seem almost indistinguishable from each other. French or similar European origin, dermatologists endorsement, slick marketing, pharma-esque packaging, premium pricing, and on. There is nothing wrong with this I suppose, and competition is good for us consumers.

Our initial impression is very good.  This Redermic C Eyes cream has a soft butter-like viscosity and rubs in very easily. It feels really nice and soothing to apply. A little bit does go a long way. It's hard to really compare these types of cream without long term usage and even then it is difficult. A key test for me personally is whether or not it irritates my very sensitive skin, and I am happy to say that it does not. So far I really like this eye cream better than most that I've tried.

I like that the tube arrives completely and unmistakably sealed.  In order to open it you must first tighten the cap all the way, which seals the nozzle onto the tube and punctures it.

Recommended, based on initial impression.",1
Not excited about this product.,0
"Loved this product for years.  Thinning hair has forced me to switch to a different type conditioner but I wish I could still use this one.  Left my hair moisturized, tangle free & super soft.  I received compliments for years on how much my hair shone!",1
"Magic-like results. Helps so much with moisture and protection for my very curly (frizzy) hair. My hair is very healthy thanks to all oribe products, but the supershine is a must!",1
Just not good. Way too floral. I could not get past the taste. I was unable to successfully give it away.,0
pleased with color,1
This stuff is very expensive and I've diligently used it as the directions state. I haven't seen growth. I am actually losing more eyelashes!! I was going to buy the mascara if I grew the eyelashes but it doesn't seem to be working. *sigh*,0
Just got this product the other day. Tried it out on my puffy eyes... and it did nothing. Absolutely no change whatsoever. Waste of money.,0
Best  concealer I have found.  Great Product.,1
"I could not be happier with the Pur Cosmetic line. I am 40 and have had acne all my life (it's awful). I used Este Lauder since college and face never looked good. I accidently bought the foundation at an Ulta store and in in two weeks my face started to clear up. I ditched all my Este Lauder products and am strictly using Pur. I start with this cleaner (which is amazing). It has a cooling sensation and I have clear skin now! It's made a world of difference for me and my daughter. I follow up with the Ceretin Serum and their moisture lotion with Pur foundation, powder and blush. I also use the mud mask once a week. My skin looks better every day.",1
Wonderful product.  Great shipping and pricecompetitive.  Will buy again.,1
It's like sprinkling salt or pepper on your head and expecting it to look like hair...Don't bother purchasing.,0
Great product,1
"This polish really does last a long time.  Usually my nails chip by the second day, but this easily lasts for 5 as long as you use the top coat.",1
"I seem to see an improvement after only a week of use in the furrows between my brows and the corners of my mouth. I'll keep using this because nothing else I've tried has made such a change so quickly.

edited: I took a star off because the change was limited. You can probably get the same effect with an alpha glycolic acid cream for much less money.",1
"The Sultra The Bombshell Rod Curling Iron I really like. I am able to quickly and easily achieve the styles for my hair that I was hoping to get from a styling tool such as this.

For the higher price tag, I assumed this would have a few more features like beeping when I've held a curl long enough ( 8 seconds per instructions) or an option to adjust the heat but it doesn't.  Because it doesn't have these features, I am taking a a star off just because I feel for the price these important and somewhat expected features should have been implemented.

The features this curling iron does have is that it heats up very quickly, there's a 9-foot no-tangle swivel cord, an auto-shut off safety feature, and it's light-weight. Included is a styling glove and an iron pad to rest the iron on when needing to place it down while styling your hair.
My hair is very long. It's thick and normally quite wavy. That being said, I do have to spend some time on my hair for certain styles. I typically use this iron to achieve a few ringlets here and there but not all over. The results come out great when paired with heat protection sprays applied first.
The Curling iron is easy to use. There is one power switch which goes up and down i.e off and on. I haven't accidentally bumped it off when styling.  Since there is no adjustable heat settings, there's nothing else to fiddle with. You simply wait about a minute and the iron is ready to use. When styling it's important to use the glove so you don't accidentally burn yourself. When wrapping and getting to the last bit of that hair to curl my fingers get pretty close to the heating unit so I am glad the glove is included.
The amount of time needed for each curl to set will fully depend on how much hair your grab at once. If it's a smaller, thinner amount I would suggest 8 seconds but it's a thicker amount 15 seconds may be better. There will be trial and error to find what best works so a learning curve is necessary.

I can style my hair with this tool and results can last for a couple of days. I am quite pleased with the look I get and how no-brainer this tool is to use. I didn't get any weird bumps or things like others have mentioned in their reviews. I am including pictures of my waves and ringlets with my post so you can see the results I got.

There is a two-year warranty on this product which is great for the money you'll be shelling out on it. I feel the price is reasonable for the high-quality hair styling you can achieve. The product is solid and does what it should minus a few features I hope they'll add to their next model.",1
Have a slight smell to them but nothing that you can't handle. Works well and you can't beat the price!,1
"This lotion works very well.  I'm very fair, but this lotion gives me a natural-looking tan without any streaks or that all-to-familiar fake tanner smell. The tan builds over several applications, so  it's hard to misapply it. I started with the light to medium color, but eventually switched to the medium-dark in hopes of getting longer-lasting color. Even with the darker color, I find that I need to apply it most nights to maintain the color.  It also takes a while to dry, and goes quickly (one bottle lasts me about three weeks).  I highly recommend this if you find it hard to get an even application from fake tanners and don't mind the hassle of applying nightly and waiting for it to dry, but if you'd like a more economical option that will last a few days in between applications, this probably isn't for you.",1
"Its has been a few years since i started using The Art of Shaving Shaving Cream , and this is by far the best  shaving cream i have used.",1
"Smells GODAWFUL and ALL the products feel thick and sticky, doesn't feel like it's moisturizing my skin whatsoever. I actually think that this was the reason why my skin ended up being so itchy!  I felt like it would tug at my skin as I applied it. Worse ever.
Don't get this product if the smell is an issue and lack of moisturizing is another.",0
Appeared to have been used. Had brown streaks all over the barrel,0
The plastic cap breaks by breathing on it and i haven't found any replacements,0
"I have fine hair and this dryer doesn't fry it. Best one I have owned so far and I'm a Cosmetologist, so I've had a ton.",1
toooo grimey,0
"My hair is just starting to get thin in front top sides, this product definitely helped.",1
"This is a counterfeit nail polish! Do not buy.
I purchased the color Rosey Future and it does not match the consistency and color of the original OPI color. Even the bottle looks different. What I received did not match the image listed here. Really disappointed.",0
"This does not rub in, is very hard to apply, and comes off and streaks if you touch your legs after putting it on.",0
"I gave this product 4 stars only because it is much more dense than I thought it would be.  The color is perfect for me as I have silver hair and a beige tone to my skin.

Where I used this first was on my forearms where I am beginning to get some age spots....as well I should since I AM a certified senior citizen.  Ialso have a Maine Coon Cat that softly nips at my skin to tell me thanks for scratching him under his chin.  Those little bites, however, makes marks sometime on this aged skin.  This cream did cover up both the spots and the nips.  I used my fingertips and just patted where they were and after a few moments I rubbed over the patted spots and smoothed it out on my arm.  It worked quite well.

I have not tried it on my face yet as I wanted to see what it looked like where I needed good coverage the most.  I do think I would have liked a creamier version better but maybe the coverage would not have been as good.  I shall use it tomorrow when I am preparing this old face and
if it covers like it did on my arm I shall try to come back to this review if someone can tell me how to do it.  I shall then raise the stars to the higher level.
I just had more to hide on my arms than my face so I wanted to try there first.",1
"This smells amazing!  I smell like Christmas morning, I swear!  For me, this scent isn't super noticeable until I start to get a little warm.  Hard to explain....but I don't know about you, but I want to smell better when I'm getting hot and sweaty....so this is fantastic!",1
This lotion dried out my skin terribly and the fragrance was so strong and unpleasant. Such a major letdown because the LRP anthelios sunscreen and Toleraine hydrating facewash are HG status for me,0
Gave as a gift they seem to like it,1
Works great!,1
This is a huge waste of money.  It barely smells like Nantucket Briar. I have a smaller bottle of the lotion that I bought from a shop and did a smell test  just to  be sure...and even my husband could tell the difference.  It also arrived late and in bad condition.  What's with Amazon these days?,0
"Great smell, feels good, love using it.",1
"Great product, fast shipping.",1
"My husband loves this. Hes been using it for years. So, I guess it does what its supposef to do.",1
This item did not work for a month before it lost ability to charge.  Total waste of over $200.,0
"Good product for ragged cuticles.  Just have to remember to use it after doing the dishes.  Keep it by the kitchen sink.
A bit pricey.",1
I like this product and when used regularly it lift and tighten. Be sure you use the contact gel.,1
"Bought this because of the scent and the great reviews it receives.  However, I am noticing almost  all of the reviews are from ""Vine Customers"" who received it for free. Which I understand doesn't mean they are forced to give a 5 star review but is truly looking like that's how it is.  Scroll through all the reviews and most of them are the ""Vine Customer"" who received it for free.  I would be more opt to give a great review if I got a $50.00 product for free as well so its just hard to believe 100%.  So far I enjoy the scent and quality but will update if it doesn't turn out to be a $50.00 worth product",1
Super bummed that this is a travel size. For the price I paid it should be a normal size I would have thought.,0
"Great quality, nice fragrance! Fast speed! It is exactly the same as I found in Macy's. I like it very much.",1
"Bought two bottles and one bottle was definitely the original, however the second bottle upon using it, is not the same!! And when I did the finger blob test it ran down my finger very runny :(
Lame!!! And now I cant return it! Cause the return window closed since moving on to the second bottle. Very annoyed!",0
Both exploded in the sealed plastic and box... Disappointed,0
"It smells like Gasoline, I do not like the way you feel it on your face. I do not recommend it !",0
Pricy - but works!  Did my research and found this is the best hair removal tool on the market.  My wife's happy - so I'm happy.,1
Average,0
"At the beginning when I saw this product i was not sure it the price worth it since it is quite expensive if you compare it with other products of the same kind. I decided to give it a try and the results are awesome! The cleaser leaves your skin smooth and clean, plus the smell is the best!!",1
This is simply the best skin cleaning device on the market. It is important to dry the brush heads following each use. And do not apply pressure to the device while using it. Please make sure you use enough water and gently cleanser during use.,1
"I use this neck cream morning and night and feel that it has helped improve the texture of the skin on my neck.  Be sure to use just a little as it absorbs quickly and if you use too much, the excess is visible when it dries.",1
"I did not care for this fragrance, but will use it up since it is pricy.",0
"I purchased this with the La Roache-Posay Creamy Cleanser after reading positive reviews.  I have sensitive skin, it tends to be dry and break-out prone.  I run a lot, so my skin suffers from sun exposure and sweat.  I have loved the cleanser, it is a little drying, but reasonable. The astringent doesn't seem to be drying or harsh, but I leaves a film on my skin that I don't like at all.  I haven't continued to use it because of this, so I don't know how effective it is.",0
"The third time I tried to use it, simply didn't work.  How is this possible? Its not cheap, its kind of expensive only to use twice.  I tried to returned it, but I couldn't because its past the 30 days for refund or exchange.  I lost my money....",0
It's fake! And evaporates within a few minutes .You are destroying the name  111 2222 333 4444 555 6666 777,0
The container was an old one. Not as pictured.,0
Super disappointed I paid $139 for this and it only lasted 8 weeks and the battery died. Very disappointed,0
"I got this in a kit I bought from Lorac, and I wasn't blown away.  It's not a bad mascara, but it's far from the best I own and not as good as I've come to expect from Lorac.  It's acceptable, which is not really what one wants in their makeup purchases.  I used it 3 times, and each time it took forever to dry so I'd get little black flecks of transfer on my lids/under eye area, a problem I don't have with other mascaras.  I also noticed I had a fair amount of darkness under my eye after wearing it all day which was probably from the mascara, or because overall it's hard to get it all off at night.  Aside from the drying and transfer problems it just didn't have any ""wow"" factor that made the downsides worth it, and the only positives are it didn't clump up and I really liked the shape of the wand.  If I'm going to wear a hard to remove mascara I'd reach for Dior or Lancome which actually has made people stop and comment on my eyelashes.  Alas, even though I adore Lorac, this product isn't one I can recommend.",0
"Although it's expensive, I don't believe in posting a review based on the price.  You can clearly see how much it is before purchasing and make your own determination.  I purchased this to help control oil and acne on my face as a lot of prescription medications for acne contain retinol.  I use it every other day or every two days depending on how dry my skin is.  It is slightly drying and I wouldn't suggest using it every day, but it has helped with the the small acne bumps on my forehead and jawline.",1
Works much better than NUME,1
It works great,1
"Beware. I loved my trial packet so much that I bought two jars, only to discover that the product not only stings but actually burns the lips if applied too liberally or frequently. II'm guessing the culprit is hyaluronic acid. Apply sparingly and use an spf lip product over it.",0
The best!,1
Too rough for my sensitive skin...,0
the product was only half full and that makes me worry if it was resold to me,0
Much smaller bottle than anticipated- make sure to pay attention to the size. I do wish this was a mineral sunscreen rather than chemical. I have had skin cancer and keep this in the car to rub on my hands and arms while driving.,1
"Ahava has a great smell, but it makes my hands feel dry. It could just be me, but it just doesn't give me the feeling that I am looking for. Sometimes it feels like I need to put more lotion. I opted for Nivea original moisture and not only does it make my hands feel moisturizer but it was cheaper!!",0
Fell apart after just a couple of uses.,0
Great value!  Good fast service.,1
I got the shellak and when I opened the box it was a mess nail polish everywhere I buy a lot of Cnd and never had such thing like this,0
this may be a knock off it doesn't smell like the original Hugo I had!!,0
I ordered a 6 ounce bottle and paid over $18 for it. I received a 2 ounce bottle. Apparently some one incorrectlt placed barcode label for a 6 ounce bottle on the 2 ounce bottle.,0
A++++++ Product!,1
"I normally shy away from toners since my first ever toner did nothing but irritate my skin. However, when I heard about this product through a youtuber, I was very excited to try it out because I heard so many good things about it. Unfortunately, it didn't work as well as I thought and once again confirmed my opinion about toners. I used it for a few days, twice a day after cleaning my face. There was noticeable irritation after the first two days of use. I stopped using it for a few days hoping my skin would adapt to it but when I started using it again it irritated my skin like the first time. So I ended up giving it to my sister and it seemed to work fine on her. She uses it to remove her makeup when she's feeling lazy and doesn't wanna cleanse her face. So I recommend anyone with sensitive skin, like me, to use it at your own risk. All I can say is like most products, it might work for some people, while it might not work for others.",0
Heat quit working after 5 months  otherwise a good dryer,0
This polish came off while I was sleeping!! This polish acted like the 99 store in quality. I do not recommend it to any one.,0
Good,1
Works okay but hate the strong smell - way too perfumed for me.,0
Great product,1
Love the product. It is the packing (bottle and pump) that are defective. The pump stem or tube is flush with the bottom of the bottle so it doesn't allow for the gel to flow into the tube to come out. Have several bottles and each one is like this. Poor quality control checks by Bliss and Amazon.,0
good value,1
"I used StriVectinLabs 5-Minute Weekly Glycolic Peel twice a week for about 4 weeks and even left on the part 2 of the treatment for much longer than the directions stated -- for about 45 minutes instead of 5 minutes. I have some fine lines and wrinkles on my face as well as a few age spots and after using this product I saw no significant improvement in my complexion.  Right after each treatment, my skin did feel super clean and my complexion glowed a bit, but that was all and it's about what one would expect if using a good facial mask and exfoliation regularly. So given the high price of this product, I cannot recommend it.

Maybe my skin is just very hardy and resistant to glycolic formulas. I've used Neostrata 15 gels before and they never sting or tingle much. I have also used Retin-A on my skin in the past so I know what a strong skin treatment can do to improve the complexion.  I was very disappointed with this StriVectinLABS product.",0
"What an elegantly crafted set! I own a few Henckels knives and scissors and am familiar with the quality of their products. This is definitely in keeping with the precision and design the brand is known for. The scissors are very James Bond, and I hate to admit I had to read the instructions to figure them out. They're pretty clever and streamlined! The file is of excellent quality as well, and the precision with which everything lines up for the nose hair trimmer is pretty impressive. Having said that, the last item pinches a lot. Maybe I haven't figured out the rhythm of how to use it, but the nose hair trimmers really pull on those hairs, so I had to take a star off. It hurts! In good news, they are manual and do not require batteries. The case is leather, very elegant, and has room to add a few other toiletries like Q-tips or little manicure scissors, or something of comparable size.

Excellent product with an upscale price tag. Nice if you can afford it!",1
"I have a problem.  My feet get dry and if I don't put lotion on them at night, my legs feel restless.

I've tried many lotions, and some leave my feet feeling hot.  Others leave my feet feeling oily.

I need a light clean moisturizer that will last and keep my feet cool so I can sleep.  Restless Leg Syndrome gets worse when I'm tired or my feet get warm.

I did a google search and found this was highly rated for cooling long lasting moisture.  I came to Amazon expecting a hefty price and was pleased and surprised at how affordable it is!  I bought a bottle and I LOVE IT!!!  I will definitely be buying more!",1
"I'm getting ready to re-order this product for the second time.  The first time I used it I thought OMG it looks orange, but after smoothing it on and blending, it was very natural and gave all day coverage.  It doesn't take much just a half or less of a pump. Gives good coverage and evens out the complexion. I'm glad to find this on Amazon because at Stila it's $44 not including shipping.",1
"The foundation is very thick and cakey and just sits on your skin. It's very hard to blend and smooth out. Even with a small amount on, you have that ""too much makeup"" look. It also yellowed and darkened in color on my face as the day went on. Luckily I had a free sample, but I will never buy a bottle.",0
"Nice and gentle, doesn't feel sticky afterwards like most toners. I originally gave it 4 stars...but they did not list the green coloring they added in the ingredients. They only listed 3 ingredients, aloe, water and some im assuming preservative... BUt aloe is not green like that. I have all natural aloe vera liquid (Aubrey Organics). It is milky clear. When I add water to make my own toner, it is just like aloe juice you drink, milky clear transparent. I'm disgusted that they would withhold what the ingredients really are in this day and age. Who knows how much ""aloe"" is in it if there's any at all? Maybe it's just colored water. I have attached a picture of my Aubry orgains organic aloe juice mixed with water next to the Mario Aloe toner. A stark difference indeed. The Mario one smells like nothing. So save ur money and buy some aloe vera liquid and mix with water.",0
"Don't misunderstand, I loved it for a year, but then then the batteries died .  It is impossible to change them, thus rendering the device completely obsolete.  So don't get too attached, unless you're ready to  buy a brand new one every year.  SHAME, Clarisonic.",0
Good product but pricey for what it is,1
"I have been using it for 6 weeks now on a surgical wound on my face and I haven't seen a change, however maybe it works for others.

Pros...
None for me

Cons...
Does't work like it says it does

The breakdown on how I determine my star rating of a product
5 stars  I love it! It is awesome and I highly recommend that everyone purchase this product!
4 stars  I like it, but there are some flaws. Not everything can be perfect! I would purchase again.
3 stars  It was okay, but I would probably not buy it again unless I had no other choices.
2 stars  There may be worse products out there, but you can definitely find better choices.
1 star  I dislike the product, I wish I had not purchased it and do not recommend anyone else to purchase it.

If my review helped please take a second and click that it was helpful below.

My goal is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer. My remarks are sincere and true. I hope that these reviews are helpful to others. Once again, it is just my own opinion and experience with the product, your own opinion and experience may vary.",0
"I really like this perfume. It is feminine without being overly floral. My husband said it smelled almost unisex to him. If you ever smelled Escada's Magnatisim before it was discontinued,  it is a lighter version of that. While it lasts, it has a hint of fruit and vanillaish(made up word) musk scent. It is so light that it evaporates to nothing within an hour or two. I still love the smell, but I wish it would last longer.",1
Worked well on my AA hair.,1
I love this shade.  Cannot be without it.,1
"I really wanted to like this sunscreen. I bought it to use for my face, and I always give face products some time to really see if they work, so I tried it for about 5 months. It was good at first (no scent whatsoever, easy to apply), but over the past month or so, I've been breaking out now more than I ever have in my life. I'm not naturally acne prone, and I haven't changed my diet or any other beauty products that I put on my face, so the culprit must be this lotion. I've even gotten a few ingrown pimples which I rarely ever get. Not recommended.",0
Exactly what I wanted.,0
so worth it,1
Great product and results.  Only negative - price is getting to much.  Not only did the price go up per bottle the size was reduced.,1
"Not convinced. I'm a male with medium-medium short thin hair.
My rating:
1/ tigi bedhead workable wax (on dump hair)
1/ sebastian craft clay (on dry hair)
3/ l'oreal architexture
4/ paul mitchell tea tree styling gel (on dump hair for hard strenght)

I like less:
5/ CHI molding clay
6/ l oreal sculpte-3
7/ sebastian shaper plus spray

Not that the last three are bad, but they give a lot of volume... With medium hair, it s dangerous hahaha!",0
Love this conditioner and it does what it preaches!! Specially if u want to get rid off the freeze hair and yet not have it wear it down,1

I feel so upset about it.

"I was extremely disappointed in this item.  It was quite small in size, unlike the previous item that I ordered, which was the shower gel. I was expecting more.  Now I know what a 1.5 oz item really looks like. TOO SMALL EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!.",0
looks like mud! do not get,0
This product as the attributes of scented water. It leaves no conditioning properties on the hair.,0
"PRO:
*This spray certainly does an  above average job with the rootlifting. (I have Boyd Crowder-ish hair that naturally grows up, until it's over ~2.5-3 inches. At that point I need an extra boost to maintain the same look, esp. right after shower.)
*Doesn't get sticky, easily distributed evenly w/o areas of extra stickiness.
*Even when applied abundantly, doesn't stiffen the hair
*Odor is very slight and agreeable
CON:  it adds some sheen to my hair, against my matte-preference (Then again, I've experienced way worse sheen with other products, it's tolerable w/ these one, and gets even less inconspicuous in a few hours).

Not  a perfect product, but not a bad choice either.",1
My fav hair product. Use sparingly on thin hair.,1
"Skin Medica is absolutely one of my favorite lines.  First introduced to it by my dermatologist and esthetician, this is a brand I can trust.  I have tried other ""dermatologist sold"" products and they pale in comparison to this line.  This sheer moisturizer is just that: it is solid enough to truly moisturize but does not leave your face feeling suffocated by coverage.  I live in a  very arid location so moisturizing my skin is a priority 24/7.  Highly recommend their alpha hydroxy-based exfoliant, at well.",1
Fills in well...stays put. I've tried others and this one is the winner. I will order again and recommend it,1
This blowdryer broke after using it once a week for six months. A terrible ripoff considering the price and that I have a blowdryer that still works from the 80's.,0
Thought it was the oil. Was disappointed and didn't want the hassle of having to return it so I just kept it. Sticking to stores where I can hold the product in my hand before buying it.,0
This is truly amazing. I love this professional flat iron. I was able to wash my hair and straighten for the first time on my own without having to go to the salon.  I absolutely loved the result.  the iron is easy to use. and it also works great for curls and waves as it gently glides through your hair without pulling your hair.  I am African-American and have relaxed hair. I would highly recommend it!!,1
"This is the greatest rip off since xo&?x.  Nice size jar and a great product but you only get a very small amount.  I was fooled by the pretty jar and the size of it.  The quantity listed is correct, you are only getting ""ONE OUNCE"" and it does not go very far.  I will not be buying this product again.

In the old style jar I received the same product but at a fraction of the cost.  I guess if you just don't care about being ripped off, go ahead and buy this product because it is a great product.",0
My product was missing the cap when I received it. It also appears as though the spray can has already been used as there is residue on it. I can tell the bottle is not full either. Not too excited about this.,0
"I have had this dryer for a while and really like it. It dries quickly and can run very hot for times when I need to dry my hair fast.  However, I can't really tell the difference between using a dryer like this and a cheaper dryer (as far as ceramic, ion, blah blah blah).  I'm not sure that there is much science behind the ""advanced"" features of dryers.",1
Its okay but not sure its worth the cost. I have used others that cost less that work just as well or better.,0
"Nice scent, very moisturizing, like the small tube for car or purse.",1
Very light weight but it had a crack after one week and I didn't even drop it!,0
Been using for 2 years with no results...,0
Very good. It really works,1
"to big for my comfort, designed for heavy duty work, may be in a salon.",0
This is an amazing cream.  I have terrible and chronic eczema.  This is the first product that I've ever used that doesn't sting.,1
powerful,1
"This product is not the same as what I purchased from Ulta. The shade is darker and is thicker consistency. Has much more 'made up' look than the natural dewiness of the store-bough product. Also, product packaging seems different too. The mirror was missing the clear protective film, and the labeling at the bottom of the actual makeup pod is different.",0
After only using this product only a month MOLD started to develop on the cover. The scrub also turns slimy & turns white if you have any water on your fingers when you grab some of it (which you always do because you need to dampen your face first). I contacted Bioelements & refused to give me a refund but offered me a discount if I bought some more of their products...no thanks!,0
"Absolutely loved it!! It left my skin so smooth and soft. Dried very quickly. Took off 1 star for the smell but it wasn't that bad. I barely notice it after awhile. I read some people saying that it left a glue residue and their black heads didn't come out. To them I say make sure you nose isn't soaking wet or don't wet your nose after applying the nose strip. I just used a wet paper towel, dabbed my nose and voila! A perfect blackead head free, ultra smooth nose!",1
Good stuff!,1
This truly works for me...I like it very much,1
Good,1
"Not only does it have an awful smell -- like ammonia and aluminum -- but I had to stop using it because it was drying out my scalp so severely that my skin started peeling. Switched back to a far cheaper, 'average' shampoo and my head was happy again. Stay away!",0
Been using for a month. Another scam UGH! $90 for nothing!,0
"I went with 4 just because you get the credit toward something else. As a whole, I really wouldn't consider most of these luxury items, but some were fun to try.",1
excellent,1
I have enjoyed the Chi brand hair dryers for several years but it seems the elements tend to burn out early. The last two Ultra Chi hair dryer elements have failed early. The first one at 13 months and the second one at 8 months. Not gonna bother with the warranty procedure. I am giving another brand a chance to shine.,0
These brushes are good however I think they are very.....expensive. I received another facial cleansing brush my husband picked up for me and like it as much and the price for the unit and brushes is a lot cheaper.,1
Really my hair is soo damaged because of years of dying and ruining it. It's great for straightening..You should buy it. Though you must be warned..It's very expensive..So use it wisley,1
Love this stuff.  Being using it for years. Gives my face a beautiful glow - I get compliments all the time. Love the natural ingredients.,1
"I love this product! I was really happy to find it on Amazon. It feels so light, like water and removes all makeup from eyes to face. Great product!",1
"Absolutely awful. It is very heavy and grainy, I had a very hard time applying makeup on top of it.",0
"I'm a newborn nanny, and also cook and bake for families. I'm constantly washing my hands. They get severely dry, especially in the winter. A few years ago, one of the moms I worked for had a tube of this and let me use hers. I loved it so much she bought me my own tube, and I've been buying it ever since. Sometimes I use a lighter lotion in the hotter months, when my hands aren't as bad. But it's the only hand lotion I use in the colder fall and winter months. The reason why I only gave it four stars....since it's a metal tube, as you're using it, tiny holes form in the ""wrinkles"" of the tube, and the lotion will break thru the holes. It's a bit frustrating. I wish they would either offer it in a plastic tube, or some type of jar. But I still continue to purchase and use the lotion. It's truly the best out there for dry hands.",1
 good product and hair is looking on point,1
it leaves a greasy film.,0
"This mascara goes on pretty smooth but comes off in clumps- very strange. It also makes my lashes stick together, kind of gummy.",0
This curling iron didn't work for me. Not sure why. My cheaper Revlon curler works better.,0
"Smells like a strange rubber tire, or chemical.....yuck.",0
"I have big eyes and fairly long lashes.  This curler fits my eye and doesn't pinch me.  Another plus, they will send you replacement rubbers for free. The only downside, it's a little pricy",1
"Having previously owned the BAB2000 Ceramix, I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend roughly 50% more on this model. I decided to try it and here's my comparison.
Titanium Pros: Lightweight!! The Black Ceramix model is pretty heavy, much heavier than typical models I used to purchase from Target. So heavy my arm would get tired and I really never got used to it after three years of use. In my opinion this would be the main reason to purchase this one over the Ceramix.

I did not notice any significant difference in the speed at which either dried my hair or the shine or hair volume.

Titanium Cons: Buttons. The heat switch and on off switch are very easily toggled on and off. They are also right where you hold it, so pretty much every time I use it I find myself accidentally switching the heat setting from high to medium or turning it off. The buttons on the Ceramix never had this problem.
Shape of dryer. Because of the shape, every time I try to wrap the cord around the head of the dryer it all slides off in to a tangled mess. This is really annoying to me for storing it. I also never had this problem with the Ceramix as that easily wound around itself to store neatly.

Bottom line: I like this dryer for the fast drying power and light weight, but if I had to choose again I would go for the BAB2000 Ceramix Extreme since it's cheaper and easier to use and store.",1
"This product is great. It works well for blemishes. However, it feels very rough and abrasive against the skin.",1
This product didn't do anything for my hair . I am returning it,0
"The Vincent Longo Radiant Blush reminds me a little of the Laura Geller line of baked make-up products that add highlights by blending different colors for blushes and make-up.

This is a nice neutral color that is a little pinkish but brightens up the cheeks for a nice finished look that isn't too heavy looking.

I like the compact a lot and it comes with a nice mirror. This is a fine quality blush that doesn't add too much color and is perfect for Spring fashions.",1
Very Efficient at drying & is pretty quiet as far as blow driers go.,1
Did not work well for me. Looked clumpy and very fake.,0
"I've noticed a great difference, I would buy again!",1
"I honestly think it smells old, not like the ones in department stores. I was going to return it and was told it was non-returnable. Thanks anyway.",0
"I've been using similar products for years and the first thing I noticed was the jar is smaller than most others in this price range.  My usual go to was 4.2 oz and this is only 1.7 which is small for $20.  That being said, for the length of my hair (fairly short) I only need to use a pea size amount so it should still get some mileage out of this jar.  I rub it between my hands and apply to my hair while still wet and then blow dry it as I style.  I usually go back with just a tad extra and spot style a few places.  It rinses out easily with shampoo and doesn't seem to leave any residue.  Overall if you are a fan of Vaughn and the celebs hair his products have ended up in and don't mind the small size, you won't be disappointed, it does offer a good texture and hold.  Minus one star though for the small quantity size.",1
The spray nozzle does not work so I have a full bottle of product that I can't use. This seems to be a design flaw as other Rusk products I've used have the same problem.,0
I really liked using this device but it broke on its own while switching from cleansing to antiaging mode. It only lights up when I press the power button. So disappointing when I paid so much for this. I got a replacement from warranty and I'm scared it's just going to break soon just as the first. Foreo customer service won't do anything unless you keep calling to further along the process when I put in my claim to replace it.,0
"I don't know if the bottle I bought was old. I put on two layers and a topcoat, the next day they peeled right off!!!! So I thought maybe I would try it without the top coat and it still peeled off! I am really bummed because I always use OPI polish and I have never had this problem. I am going to return this polish.....or attempt. Hopefully the people won't think I am crazy for returning it.",0
"I like it. It's light, sheer, but a bit buildable (though I don't like to build any foundation), and doesn't cake, and isn't so matte that it emphasizes pores, lines, etc. Nice little CC cream.",1
"I first used this in DC when a stylist there recommended it. However, he warned me to use it sparingly or else it behaved ""strangely"" on the hair. I used sparingly, and over time, I saw what he meant. It started off great, and then somehow it actually started to dry out my hair over time while making my hair get an odd sticky feeling. I never used more than a dime sized amount when I applied it. Perhaps it works better with other hair textures. I've stopped using it and switched to coconut oil. My hair and scalp thank me.",0
No scent. I think it's fake. Been using oribe for many years and this is a terrible product. Does nothing for my hair. Save your money and try a different vendor,0
"I bought this based on the reviews and it doesn't work with my hair. I have thin, fine blonde straight/wavy hair. My hair has a natural wave to it if I let it air dry. I washed my hair one day and followed the directions and it didn't do anything to my hair. Kind of disappointing.",0
"Great for sensitive skin and eyes (no sting), no white residue. Love it.",1
"For a small object, I was charged $12.00 for shipping, which is way to expensive.  I will never buy these again.",0
I use this after my curls have dried.  Alittle emulsified in my hand and used through my hair (i have short hair) and my curls are alittle more defined and shiny.  The key is a little gies a long way.  My hair is fine and somewhat thin.  It did arrive with small hole in the tube and i lost about 1/2,1
I have purchased this on Amazon many times and it is sticky and a different consistency than the bottle purchased in store.  It is also a slightly different color. It makes my daughters' skin break out. They do not break out when I buy from the B&M stores.  Cannot recommend.,0
"I had one of these for years and it just recently stopped working. Im not sure what happened, but it apparently did not agree with traveling this last time. I liked it so much I wanted to purchase the exact same straightener. I was glad to find the same product available still...

Unfortunately my experience with this seller was very disappointing. 5 minutes after opening my package, I began the return process. The product was used and had scorch marks on it.",0
I am very disappointed. I have owned several bottles of this before from real retail stores and loved it. I feel like I got a fake or a knock off. waste of money.,0
Color is not quite what it looked like on line. Still pretty,1
The smaller bottle came empty and the box was wet! The product must have leaked out!,0
Best blush I have ever purchased. Abbey Rose is a beautiful color to brighten up your complexion.,1
"Compared to the regular gloMinerals Satin II foundation, Luxe felt much oilier on my skin. It also did not provide a full coverage like the original does. It also has some shimmering effect, or could it be just the oily nature of this foundation? I am going to stick to GloMinerals protective foundation (http://smile.amazon.com/glominerals-gloProtective-Liquid-Foundation-Honey-Light/dp/B001HXAI8S/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1416879845&sr=8-8&keywords=glominerals)",0
You really have to clamp down hard to get your hair straight.  It gets tiring when you have a lot of hair!  It could also get a bit hotter in my opinion.,1
Was hoping for more of a miracle with this product....  I've used it several times now and I don't feel any tingling or notice any exfoliating.  The disappointment is that my face does not even feel clean after using it.  The fragrance is great and I generally love Jan Marini products so I will give it a few more chances.,0
"i hate this product, i don't know whether you guys gave me the right product or not  because I have not had this worse reaction of my hair to any hair product that i got with this shampoo..I want my money back...I hate this product",0
"I tried a sample in a store and the perfume that I ordered smelled a bit different. Maybe because the store sample was old. I
don't know. Maybe my sense of smell was different at that time. Anyway, I wear it and don't believe I would buy it again. I like more
of a floral smell, which I thought this was.",1
I love CND and have bought their polish in stores with good results. Can typically get an entire week with no chips. This particular color / polish I cant go a single day (even with the CND clear top coat) without a chip. Frustrating!,0
"works as advertised.  It's one of the better ones.  Give it a try - if you like, use the blower adapter -- that works best.",1
"The shampoo box came open, and there was no plastic film sealing the shampoo as there always is. The shampoo basically came open and not full to the top.

Thanks",0
"I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed by this hair dryer.  My old hair dryer needed replacing because it got too old, and I looked forward to receiving this model.  However, I used it and don't like it for the following reasons.  First of all, it is too large and heavy for me to hold over and around my head.  It is a bit of an awkward shape, but mostly it was just too heavy.  Secondly, even on the highest heat setting, it does not seem to get hot enough.  It seems more like my old hair dryer on low heat setting.  And for third, the attachments were useless for me.  With the big diffuser attachment, running it through my medium-long hair was almost impossible.  I tried to do it like the booklet said, but it just wasn't practical and also the big diffuser would keep popping off.  The other attachment, the concentrator, I didn't really need.  So I put a volumizer lotion in my just-washed hair, tried the attachments, and finally just used the hair dryer without any attachments to get my hair dry.  The speed of the fan in the dryer was alright, but it just did not get hot enough for me.  It did not dry my hair enough so that the volumizer lotion worked.  So I looked sort of flat haired all day.  I expected the dryer to puff my hair right up, but it didn't, and I was disappointed.  Ordinarily while using a dryer, I would hold the dryer in one hand and the hair brush in the other, so I could smooth out my hair as it was being dried, but the weight of the dryer was just too heavy.  I realize the dryer advertises infrared heat and other new innovations, but I'd rather use my old, mini hair dryer that had a brush attachment built in so that I only needed one hand.  I'm sorry to say but I cannot recommend this hair dryer.",0
"This cream works miracles for one of my boys with eczema. Two of my kids have eczema, and for one child only Aveeno eczema cream works, and only THIS lotion works for the other. Obviously we try to avoid the triggers (dairy in particular) but when they do have a break out using the right cream for each child does wonders.",1
I love this scent. I am very sensitive and prefer light scents and this one is just that.  Smells wonderful and just light enough to kiss my skin!,1
Its makes hair very heavy and greasy not essy to manage,0
"I have been using this product on and off for the past 8 years, for stress-induced premature female hair loss that has been tied to hormone issues.  I would use it for several months, then stop since it didn't seem to work to grow my hair; it just made what I had extra thick, full of body, but feeling like I had use bad 80's hair gel or spray.

They reformulated it; I've bought it 3 times since then, using it consistently for the past several months.  Now it makes my hair thicker, denser, and full of body, but also soft.  I love this!

As far as regrowing hair, it is adding to my entire regimen.  Nioxin provides an outside-in topical treatment, and I meet it more than half way with an inside-out treatment.  I got my hormones balanced so there is no more testosterone sensitivity.  My doctor also started me on a new diet and supplement regime (Biotin, Niacin, Iron).

I had premature frontal hair loss that was noticeable for years.  It receded in a certain pattern.  Now, it's awkwardly growing back in reverse so it looks like I cut bangs on the sides of my face but there's nothing in the middle yet. There are also sprouts and baby hairs visible on the top of my forehead.

Since the middle is the last area where the regrowth needs to occur (and from the sprouts it will), I add Toppik&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toppik-Hair-Building-Fibers-36oz-Medium-Brown/dp/B003OELYFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toppik Hair Building Fibers (.36oz) - Medium Brown</a>to it, a keratin fiber hair-filler powder.  The toppik should not affect hair growth but I still wash it out at night.

My doc said it will take about 2 years for full regrowth (once I started the meds and supplements).  It's been 6 months so far, and I'd say that's about right.",1
The color is very pale and was not complementary to my skin color. I feel I wasted my money on this particular color because I will never wear it. I wish there was a way to exchange these colors in instances where once we have recieved the color we realize it is not what it looked like over the internet.,0
"Love the smell and seems to clean very well without stripping hair, just started using and will update in a few weeks.",1
"It's good but I prefer the ""soy"" lotion over the black honey as the aroma may wear on your nerves after a while.",1
SMELLED LIKE A FUNERAL PARLOR UGH!,0
"I opened this hair brush and it had long, dark hair in the bristles! I have short blond hair. Obviously someone returned it and then they sent it out to me. Absolutely disgusting. This reaffirms my previous decision to NEVER buy personal care products through Amazon. I would have given it a 0 if possible.",0
"It works to smooth my nails out if there are any imperfections. It dries fast, too. I really haven't noticed much of a difference when it comes to them hardening or peeling or anything. When the manicure gets a little older, the whole nail polish peels up in one piece.",1
"Good razor I ordered the long handle one, but got the short with the guard still does the job so can't complain too much.",1
"I keep this in the shower, a little more of a traditional soap/thick lather product. Since I often will shave in the shower, using this helps make sure my disposable razor blades last longer.",1
"I would give it negative stars if there was such an option. The one sent to me was a fake one you can tell by the look, watery and smells horrible, and it won't dry! Stay away from this, read other negative reviews with pictures that show you the comparison of this fake one and a real OPI.",0
Lasts about a month. Very effective and smells great!,1
"This eye massager is a unique product, I have started incorporating it into my daily routine. I would suggest reading the instructions fully before using this product. To unlock the device, hold the + and - buttons down together for 3 seconds.  If you use eye serum, apply it before you use the massager. There is a detailed display in the quick start guide about how to apply the massager. The massager is made of a silicone like material that feels nice and soft against the skin. You can adjust the intensity of the pulsing to suit yourself. The massage itself feels great, you just move the massager along under the eye and along the brow bone for 30 seconds per eye. Be careful not to apply to the eye lid or eye ball. I can tell a reduction in under eye puffiness and dark circles after about a week of use.  Made in China.  If you do a search, youll find a video online as well, which may be helpful for you to get started.",1
I feel like this was only filled halfway because it was gone really quickly and I don't use much eyeliner. It did not go on easy as predicted and it smudged under my eyes on my concealer. Not happy with this product.,0
"bottle was not full and unfortunately it did not smell the same as in the store I first got to smell it.  Lesson learned, do not buy on internet.",0
"This product was not quite what I thought I was getting and not what i really wanted. The spray is 'okay' but left my hair feeling heavy and sticky. I prefer (and sincerely miss) the Control Twist liquid wax. I would return the spray, but I used some, so I do not think I can. I will just give it to a theater group I know for their backstage bucket.",0
Left my color damaged hair soft and smelling great!,1
love it makes my hair look shiny.  Have curly hair and works well with my hair down.,1
"Anti-aging? Dont think so, the main ingredient is ALCOHOL which ages your skin faster than the sun itself.  Then when it smells like alcohol and you notice its terrible for your skin they DONT ACCEPT RETURNS.  Really not happy.",0
"This definitely, definitely helps with keeping blonde highlights bright! I would give it five stars but  my hair feels rough if I don't use conditioner with it.",1
"I wouldn't say I noticed a HUGE difference after once use, but while the product was sitting in my hair is was really soft and silky looking. Just in once use, I have noticed a little more strength and not as much fizziness. I have a lot of hair so I basically used the whole bottle in one use... as much as I would like to continue to use it once a week to see if I notice more of a difference, I would probably have to pass on it because I can't afford paying 22.50 a week (90.00 a month) for a product for my hair.",1
Love this product! It makes washing your face fun! :),1
These work great and smell awesome!,1
"I had read good comments, I ordered it but it is so small, hada hard time grabbing my eyelashes. One I did it hurt & even lost some eyelashes. Had to do it few lashes at a time since rubber is not even an inch long. Pinched myself a couplemof times. Too much trouble so I had to request a refund. Amazon was very good on my return.",0
"I purchased this at another respectable discount store for a lot less and I like it. My pores are starting to shrink. I leave it a little bit longer than 5 mins. Probably 8 to 10. My face is red afterwards for a little bit and I feel it clean. I also seem to see it a little bit brighter but I can't say if it's because of this or a vitamin c serum I got from Kiehls. Either way, I will keep using this. If you have sensitive skin this might not be for you. My skin has big pores and it's not prone to acne. Good luck if you decide to try it.",1
"I have used and loved the L'occitane shea lip balm before.  I ordered 3 of these from BeautyBridge, via Amazon.

What a nightmare.  As soon as I opened the package I could tell something was wrong.  The product did NOT smell like the original L'occitane lip balm.  It had a heavy rancid petroleum smell to it.  Stupidly, I tried it on my lips and it was completely hardened like a crayon or candle wax.  I immediately got a headache from that petroleum smell.  I immediately washed the balm off only to discover the next day that it had actually burned my lip.

So far I have received several incoherent emails from the company.  They keep claiming that I want to keep the product AND receive a refund and I just can't get them to comprehend that I will more than happily mail this rancid caustic garbage back to them but they must send me a mailing label and refund my full purchase price. They say ""Your words are no good"".  Whatever that is supposed to mean.  And the last email had some kind of a warning that I was supposed to ""watch"" my language, even though my end of the correspondance with them has been professional and to the point.  No profanities or obscenities.  Really weird people.

A very strange and unreliable company with incompetent and paranoid ideas about customer service. Beware.",0
Way too expensive for only getting a third of the jar full.  It only last a few uses.  But overall if it's just for special occasions it might be what you're looking for.  Not something I'd want to pay for every day use.,0
"I don't think it makes your color last any longer, if anything it turns red hair pink...theres a way cheaper alternative at sallys. I don't like the smelleither . It smells like baby powder.",0
Good fash wash. I like the grainy texture.,1
"Essie nail polish usually impresses me, but this polish does not last more than a couple days. I would be very surprised if it was real Essie.",0
"Great moisturizer for dry, mature skin. No breakouts or feeling greasy. Goes a ling way.",1
"Doesn't blend well, and I've used way cheaper foundation that impressed me more.",0
Hairstylist suggested it. I have very short fine thin hair! I love this product. IT does make my hair fuller and keeps it in shape all day. LOVE IT!!!,1
"I've been using 4%, 8%, and 10% in different products and haven't lightenened discoloured areas. So thought I take it up a few notches to 20%. Haven't been using long enough to notice any changes so I don't have an opinion.",1
"This was an expensive pencil that breaks when applying, breaks when sharpening and is a devil to draw a straight line with.",0
"But after going through the two scrubbing heads that come with the product, I cannot purchase a replacement head, and thus cannot use this anymore. So keep in mind that for how much money you are paying for this, you will not be able to purchase a replacement head, and will only be able to use the wand until both heads are used up. For the love of god, don't drop one of the heads down a drainpipe or anything, because you just lost half the value of your purchase.

Such a rip off.",0
"i received one of them completely broken
however the other one was fine (useable)
but this wasn't as great as i thought it would be",0
This is by far the best dry shampoo I've ever used.,1
Smell very cheap. Don't recommend.,0
"But it's true. I have to admit that I haven't applied it consistently because it irritates my eyelids and eyes, but I try to apply it every night and I believe I'm seeing results. My man has naturally long lashes and I always give him a hard time for it, but now he's noticing that mine are getting longer. I also apply a little to my eyebrows, and they've filled in really nicely too. I am happy with the purchase, and results so far.",1
Dries the surface of the area but doesn't penetrate below the skin to prevent future break outs in the same area.,0
Love this scent for many years I have used it. Perfect blend of sweet notes and lasts most the day. How cute is the bottle too!!,1
"I am no perfume expert by any means and rarely purchase any.  There are some perfumes that you can smell and right away your head starts to throb a bit from the odor.  I was worried this might be one, but my first smell test of it showed that I didn't have to worry about that.  It was very light and airy smelling...at first.  I put some on my neck and wrists and forced my husband to sniff it and he approved.  I then got in my car to drive, with windows up, and soon it became a much stronger smell and a little thicker in scent.  I worried my workmates would get put off by it, but that proved not to be a problem.  I really didn't even smell it much later on during the day, and alas, no one commented on it.  I guess the lesson learned was to put on a bit less and do a more indirect spraying of the mist when putting it on.

To me this seems like a pretty safe bet of a perfume purchase.  It might not be someones favorite, but I don't think many people will hate it because it does come off as light and fresh smelling.  The bottle is by no means eye catching, but I for one am appreciative of its wide base.  Tall skinny bottles just get knocked over too easily, and don't get me started on cats and knocking stuff over.",1
"I only used it once and I am not quite sure I love it.  It dries fast, which is great! However, the smell is pretty strong for the first 5 -10 minutes. My nose is pretty sensitive; therefore, it might not be that obvious to everyone. All of my polishes are OPI and it seems to work well with them.",1
"I bought another GO that was blue for a bit more and it heated fine, still a bit too long. Not worth the price of return. will have to make due for now. I also bought the travel chi (I thought it was made by FHI  too?) from QVC but it was sold in a set and I did not want both. The new chi travel with new the plates and colors was great! Perfect size and heating with dual voltage. Please sell alone !!!",0
"Bought this from another store. Loved the smell of almond from the bottle and it reminded me of my all time favorite Garden Botanika almond lotion that was discontinued. Once you put it on, however, it changes to a soapy floral smell. The lotion seems almost watery instead of creamy like most lotions, so it didn't moisturize well on dry areas like elbows. Disappointed!",0
"The coverage  is very good, and it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily.",1
I bought this to replace Beautycounter tinted moisturizer. I was hoping it would have more coverage and leave the skin with less shine. No luck. It smelled awful: very minerally. It didn't absorb well and left my skin with a gross sheen. I returned it.,0
Delivered on time.  Great price for the size!,1
"Wonderful product! Goes on smoothly, and has a thin enough tip to draw hair-like lines... Which helps to keep the eyebrows looking natural (and not like you drew two caterpillars on your face).",1
"A little liquidy so it takes a bit more effort then regular mascara but is great stuff. No problems with my sensitive eyes, makes my blonde lashes look long and black. My lashes are healthier and longer from using this vs regular mascara.",1
This eyeliner is difficult to put on - it's like the brush drops down and drags in it wiping some off as it is applied. It is also hard to keep it out of your lashes. I would not buy this again and hate that I spent so much on it.,0
"I have used this product for years. But his bottle I received in March 2016 does not smell or work like true the Loma Curvy Creme I have purchased in the past. I love the smell of the real Loma product; this smells horrible and it does not work like I have come to expect from the Curvy Creme. I don't believe this is the ""real"" thing",0
This is not really neon. You have to put 3 coats since it's sort of clear the first coat and streaky the second coat.,0
"I dyed my hair platinum blonde several months ago and was looking for a go-to conditioner I could use for my very dry hair. I had heard rave reviews about this product and decided to go with it. Overall, it wasn't for me. I have very thick, natural and coily 4b/4c hair and this conditioner sort of just sat on my hair rather than condition it. I'm not dyeing my hair that blonde anytime soon, but when I do I think I'll stick to deep conditioning with oils and try out the Clairol Shimmerlights.",0
Love this mascara.,1
great and gentle for my skin,1
Love itGreat product for the price.,1
I loved the color & how smooth & easy it was 2 apply but after only a few minutes of wearing it started 2 run. Everyone does not have this problem so if u don't then u will love this!,0
Misleading product. Don't fall for the claims.,0
"Is concealer worked great cause coverage wise. However,  getting it off and applying it were both difficult.  It was like drawing on my face with a crayon.  I had to return this due to that.",0
"This is an okay tool. In comparison to other curling irons I own, It doesn't really create the effect I want. In order for it to do anything more than straighten my hair, I have to keep it on my hair way too long. I really wouldn't recommend it.",0
This stuff smells soooooo good but I only got to use it once because I dropped it and it literally shattered. Buyers beware not to drop it or else your money will shatter along with it :(,0
Great self tanner!  It absolutely lasts a full week! Love it!,1
Dried my hair out and killed my curls. Went back to my drugstore brand- way cheaper and much better results.,0
"I had never heard of this product until I saw it on Pinterest, gave it a try and if you follow directions, it does the job.",1
Can't see that it makes any difference.  Would not buy again and would not recommend,0
"Boyfriend likes this. Of course it doesn't grow hair back, but the hair looks somewhat nicer. The Rene Furterer Triphasic worked better for him.",1
"I have fine hair. This oil, no matter how little I use, just weighs down my hair and makes it look oily. I didn't notice any change in the actual health of my hair. Maybe people with dry, curly hair can use it.",0
"So I have been using LRP for the past 5 years and have been a loyal customer of this brand. it has a light weight texture which makes it easy to apply It spreads evenly and absorbs quickly.
Yet something in the formulation broke me out. Not sure because of any change in the formulation (?) or the quality of this specific tube that I got.",0
"I love OPI but not a huge fan of this color - I Eat Mainly Lobster. An odd orange color, it looks both dull with a a flourescent undertone. Will not buy again",0
This stuff would last forever if I could tolerate the incredible stickiness. It creates a goopy mess on your mouth - wish I wouldn't have bought it.,0
"Don't get it, it's horrible clumps, and take for ever to dry... Nothing special about it",0
"it gets all over your sink, under your nails, and doesn't work",0
"I love my Mia2, I never would have bought this thing for myself because I didn't fully understand why a washcloth and exfoliating cream couldn't do the exact same thing. My mom bought this for me as a Christmas present and after the first use I was in love. My face just feels so refreshed and rejuvenated, it's extreme cleaning that you can't get with anything else. It's much too harsh for everyday use, I'm not sure why people are using this daily that's not what it's made for. I use mine weekly to remove the weekly build up of dead skin, oil and makeup. Unfortunately, my mia2 broke last week and was still under warranty by 2 weeks. The company was so nice to me that I was baffled, I couldn't even be mad that my clarisonic broke because they had another one in the mail by the end of the phone call with complementary shipping. Wonderful product, wonderful company!",1
"Great Shampoo, my shoulder length color treated hair was very frizzy. This shampoo helped tame mostly all of that frizz",1
"I have this dryer in pink. It's still the Ceramic Xtreme Pro. I'm the only one that uses it. It's not used professionally. It was a more expensive model than this red one. Didn't last long at all. It's overheating. The handle gets super hot while I'm drying my hair. When my husband checked it out, he said the motor is overheating and drawing too much current. Guess I'm pitching it and looking for a different brand. A lot of money down the drain.",0
"Shipping wasn't bad, but the liquid eye primer came completely empty. Also the shadow came all clumped together. I haven't tried it yet, but for the money payed, I'm not a happy camper.",0
My under arms are very sensitive and this would not work for me. Burning and itching for three days after using it.,0
I love the feeling on my lips. And it's so easy to use. Wish it was a bit smaller to fit in my cosmetic bag.,1
"When curling Iron didn't work well first time I thought it was user error. I used it second time, same thing. Bummer is that by that point I couldn't return it so now I'm stuck with a curling iron that doesn't work on my hair .",0
"Alright, ignore the persiflage in the product description, ""a fresh, masculine scent that embodies an innate male Britishness. A sparkling and refreshing fragrance. The scent features vibrant top notes of artemisia, sun-drenched mandarin tree and aqueous violet leaves. Heart notes of nutmeg, comforting Virginia cedarwood and white pepper add warmth. The woody aroma of vetiver and the soft musk of tonka beans..."" Nonsense. It smells like a mix of baby powder with a hint of sandalwood, & is entirely too effeminate for a man's fragrance. That said, they clearly used quality sources of scent, because I have always been extremely sensitive/allergic to ""industrial grade"" scents found everywhere & incorporated into almost everything from anti-perspirant to shaving cream & everything in between, and even in expensive, supposedly ""high end"" perfumes. Unlike those other products, this at least doesn't send me into a tizzy of eye-watering, nose-itching, borderline asthmatic paroxysms of discomfort. I just wish it didn't make me smell like some hottie's best gay gal-pal: the last thing I want is automatic billeting in the ""friend zone!"" Another reviewer stated that the product has been reformulated repeatedly, and that the latest versions were unsatisfactory, so I imagine that's what I rec'd., instead of the early versions that led to the rave reviews that convinced me to take the plunge on buying this online w/o prior testing. C'est la vie. Just an object lesson to read the critical reviews as well as the most popular ones on Amazon!",0
"Spray doesn't work well and the product that does come out has NO hold. Would not recommend this product. Word of caution, not returnable. I am told I will receive a refund.",0
"Not Happy:(Received wrong item:(
I would not give this any stars but it won't let me submit unless I do so:(",0
Just arived and i can already see by the box one of the products has leaked. Upon opening the bottles to check both the shampoo and conditioner have leaked about an inch and a half of the product.,0
"This really works. I have tried many other products. I never write reviews, but this product deserves a great review. Highly recommend.",1
"I have used Zoyas Naked Manicure since it was first released. I love the look, but not long after beginning to use it, my nails started peeling like crazyand my nails don't normally peel. I thought it was the fault of the (cheap) crystal nail file Id recently begun using, so I changed back to my trusty old files and continued using Naked, assuming it would help heal my peeling nails. Wrong. My nails got much worse, peeling down to the middle of my nail bed, which Id NEVER experienced before. I stopped using the Naked system and discovered Nailtiques Formula 2, which worked wonders to strengthen my nails and eventually bring them back to full health.

For three years, I did not use Naked, and my nails remained strong and healthy. I decided recently to give the Naked system a second chance and bought a new starter kit. Two weeks of using Naked, and once again my nails are horribly thin and peeling.

Bye bye, Zoya. Im divorcing you forever. Im sure you're great for many (maybe most) people, but something in your chemical makeup is destructive to my nails.

For those whove had the same negative experience with Zoya Naked, I highly recommend Nailtiques Formula 2 to repair the damage. Just be sure to keep it off your surrounding skin and cuticles, because it will thicken those, too.",0
Love it! I think it's the real deal. Compared it with one I purchased 2 years ago on Amazon and they appear identical. Very nice price too!,1
My nails are stronger than they have been in years.,1
Great hair dryer! This is what my hairstylist uses.,1
"This stuff is a miracle spray. If I am running late I can spray it in my wet hair, give it a quick toss, and it dries with a non-frizzy wavy curl look rather than my normal frizzy mess. This is something that I will most certainly invest in again.",1
Doesn't last long but I love it!,1
"i love Stila eyeshadow, but when this arrived, it was completely broken and a mess. I had to throw it away. I won't order it online again.",0
"This clay mask is amazing. There is a little tingling when you first apply it to your face, I assume that is a part of the deep cleaning process. When you wash your off it leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh.",1
I have large pores and this sunscreen seems to be too heavy for me. I always get a clogged pore after using it.,0
Blah!,0
"very good concealer.  In comparison with other hair concealers, I must rate this product a five.",1
I have followed all the directions  and I did read the reviews prior to purchase but I am disappointed in the results. Will buy another product and see what happens,0
Bought this one for my boyfriend because he tried it out at a store and we both loved it! Delivered on time and with the box in perfect conditions:),1
"It's not perfect, but it's the best one I've tried so far that doesn't irritate my eyes much. After having irritated eyes from using a competing liquid eyelash glue, I researched products for sensitive eyes. This was one that came up, so I decided to try it. It works well, goes on well, and is very easy to remove the lashes from my eyes when I'm done. It holds fairly well, but I do sometimes need to reglue edges after 5 hours or so. It also *slightly* irritates my eyes so I don't use it every day.

One very, very good thing about t his glue, in particular, is that it stays a little gummy/tacky so the glue itself is easy to remove from the eyelash band before disinfecting and reusing. The other glue I used (that irritated my eyes a lot) dried to a hard glue and was difficult to remove from the eyelash band, even with tweezers.",1
"COUNTERFEIT!
L'Occitane bottle, but a cheap counterfeit product inside - didn't even smell like almonds. Returned and ordered directly from L'Occitane website - no problems there and price was the same.
Authorities should get involved in this.",0
This conditioner is great.  I love the smell and it really protects the vitality of my color.  Makes my hair so soft and shiny.  I will definitely continue using this line.,1
"Longtime user of nioxin, but found out (along with a lot of the reviewers here) that nioxin was bought out by proctor & gamble and the ingredients for the shampoo have now changed..

really dislike the fact that when a great small product gets bought out (ie. kind bars, honest tea) by a larger parent company, immediately the larger company changes the ingredients to make it more diluted, processed, and ultimately cheaper.

new nioxin formula is not as good as the old and does nothing to remove ""DHT,"" which was the whole unique marketing angle of the original product!

no longer will be using nioxin. 2 good alternatives are:

Pura Dor Organic Argan Oil Anti Hair Loss Shampoo
HairGenesis Anti DHT Shampoo",0
The cap is impossible to open and broke off when we finally got it- product was spilled everywhere,0
Always check the tube..make sure it say..eyebrow and eyelash just like the box...if not its fake....,0
Polish does not stick too well on my nails. I redo my nails once a week. My nails last up to 3 weeks when I get them done at the salon.,1
"I tried this product before and thought it was intailly just okay because I will still getting the ""red neck"" look. I was getting tired of e-shave products comming cracked or dried out so I tried this proudct again.  Now here is what I learned to give a great shave with this product:

1. Make sure you used very warm water to wet your face and splash it on  a few times to soften the beard. Or shave after getting out of the shower.

2. Spread it evenly the amount they recommend is pretty close
3. Keep a spary bottle filled with water near by.
4. Start shaving

I found the product was drying out and I needed to remoisten it; hence the spray bottle.
I have an extremly thick fast grown beard and now this product glides easily across my face with little redness. I liked the fact when you put it on you can still see your skin so easier to see what your doing. What every you have left washes off easily.
If you want to try something new or go for a change I highly recommend this product but save your money and do not buy the hot towel preshave. It adds nothing to your shave.",1
"Amazing shampoo for silver/gray hair. Both my husband and I use it. It leaves your hair shiny, bright, removes yellowing without being harsh and turning your hair purple. Plus, it smells like fresh flowers - not what people who put scents in bottles believe fresh flowers smell like, but what REAL flowers smell like in a flower shop!! Well worth the price!",1
"The product recommends two coats of nail polish and then the top coat, but I found out that after two coats you can still see your nail color. I think with three coats will look much better and will last longer. It lasted 5 days without any peeling but I was hoping for over  week, like I said maybe a third coat will help with that too.",1
"This has an intense scent to it that may bother people who have sensitivities to strong scents, or who have skin that reacts to scented products.

I have used this on my skin and it seems to float over the top rather than soak in like some quality moisturizers.  I found it hard to resist scratching.

I can not speak at all to long term use.",0
"The plastic ppm doesn't work, but other than that it is fine.  Seems like too big of a hassle to send it back.  So, I haven't given them a chance to fix it.",0
I love this product. It is the only blush that stays all day,1
"Suface Bliss is supposed to smooth your hair.  It only smooths mine for a few minutes and I have to keep using it for any result.  Its humid where I live, and I am still loking for a product that can really combat frizzy hair.  This works but only for a short  time.",0
Love the smell of this shampoo,1
"Did not enjoy this product. The pump dispenser is very hard to use and by the time you find the strength to use it, you get a small burst of product that may not be where  you intended it to go. I am not arthritic and found this bottle mechanism very hard to use. The pumps were tight and sparse. Also, only added a small amount of volume to a specific area. Wasn't able to use as a full head volumizer because of pump, therefore I would not recommend .",0
"I purchased this from Sephora based on a recommendation from one of the girls. I wanted a mascara that would stay put during work outs and not bleed at the end of the day. ( I have oily skin and tend to get raccoon eyes from some mascara's). Personally I am not a fan of the brush, it doesn't seem to help with length or volume..like I would expect from a tubing type of mascara.. and then i find that during the days I find specs of the mascara below my eye and on the eyelid. It also completely failed for my work outs.  I have tried other tubing mascara's (Clinique, DIY) which I had no issues with. My advice is try another brand, as their formula seems lame.",0
works as expected.,1
"Works well with my fine hair, doesn't weigh it down!",1
Don't waste your money - trust me,0
"I bought my 2 jar pack at Costco for about $90.00.  Each jar size was 1.1 oz.  I trust Costco and believed if they were selling it that it must be the real deal.  With daily, liberal use, the 2 jars lasted 2 months+ and after that time I saw no change whatsoever.  There were no directives that said that one had to use the product for a longer period of time to see results.  There were no directives that said that it only works on women (I'm a man). The jars are deceptively large for the amount of product they contain.  My conclusion is that it is a nice smelling, very expensive, ineffective cream.",0
"This product has not worked for me.
I used this product for about a month and did not get any of the results promised. I have been trying to keep a goatee and have suffered explosion in new razor bumps.",0
Absolutely loved my purchase!!!:)),1
"I've own this product for many years, but this one is lighter and the blades are not smooth when wrapping your hair through it? I think this is the cheaper quality of the one I have bought from ULTA many times...",0
I only give it a 4 because its new to me. But I'm very satisfied so far. I have thinning hair on top I guess because of Meds or I'm in my 60s or both but completely satisfied so far. Ordered the trial and then ordered the next bigger one.,1
"This is a pretty cool device.  I have this and I also have the Clarisonic alpha fit and there are some things I really like about the Luna in comparison.  For one, I like that the silicone brush does not have to be replaced every three months costing me $30.00 each time.  I also like the shape because it fits better around the nose.  I have not used this for long enough to tell if it makes a difference in my skin, but it if works as well as my clarisonic then I will be happy.",1
I bought this elsewhere but sad to say that after a year the device will not hold a charge.  Don't waste your money.,0
These fibers have a weird green tinge to them.,0
Color stays on very well and it's a safe choice!,1
Doesn't work good for me,0
I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  I did nothing but dry my skin out where ever I put it. It didn't help what so ever.,0
"Can't yet give an accurate rating.had surgery and had to stop exercising for awhile. Did tingle after rubbing in...whatever that is,don't know. Get back to me on this one.",0
love it,1
This is a red with blue undertones.  It is a rich color that compliments almost anything I wear.  I love it!,1
"Both of my daughters have pretty severe acne all over their face, shoulders and back. This product did appear to decrease the redness and swelling in just a night however after several weeks has not appeared to decrease the amount of acne that they both have.  For a spot treatment however, it does make a noticeable difference in just one treatment.",1
"Very little benefit, even with mate shampoo.  It's A 10 Miracle Hair Mask works much better, for me anyway. the",0
Excellent sun shield. It makes my skin smooth and protects it from sunburn.,1
works like magic...goes from jagged chewed to the quick to presentable inside of no time...in the short time from when I received this til now..I have Nails..,1
"I am 29 with a family history of thinning hair on the female side, and I am starting to get a front-and-center place where scalp is noticeable.  I purchased Toppik in advance of the holiday season, knowing that the cameras would be out in force.

It is easy enough to apply, and doesn't really move, though I give it a quick blast of hairspray just to be sure.  Some excess can get on your forehead or on hands/sink when applying, but cleans up easy enough with water.  I have never seen it come off on clothing or my pillow or anything.  Once applied, I can forget I'm wearing it unless I absentmindedly scratch my head and come away with dark brown gunk under my fingernails (whoops).  I've even been out in a light rain and been okay.

This isn't a miracle product or anything, and I scoff a bit at the idea that it's composed of ""tiny microfiber hairs"" or whatever the copy claims.  But the bottom line is that appearance-wise, it takes a large thinning spot where the scalp is very visible and noticeable, and makes it look the same as other, fuller areas of my hair.  And that's exactly what I was looking for.",1
"the buffering liquid was a bit hard to use, but I like the drying lotion and finish off with the drying cream. zits dramatically reduced in 2 days.",1
It is too overpowering a cologne for me.  If you are expecting this to smell like the original CK Euphoria it will disappoint you.,0
This is basically a bleaching cream.  I have used for 3 weeks and not noticing any change.,0
"As others mentioned, the applicator for this item is what's the downfall.  I enjoy the eye cream, but it is quite annoying to have the unit fall apart with regularity.",0
I prefer the hybrid version of this brush.  It does a much better job along the gum line and between teeth than the non hybrid version.,1
"Smells great, cleans well.  I don't know that it makes the gray look any brighter.",1
"This is a perfect match with the beard wash. easily style your beard after washing it, keeps all the scraggly ends tamed and makes my boyfriends beard super soft",1
Seems to have an odor.  Not what I wanted.,0
"Normally this gel is gel-like. This time it's very watery, disappointed.",0
This is a 2 chamber serum and one of the chambers does not work.  It's very frustrating considering I spent so much money.,0
This is a must have for my drying skin!  I use it every night on my face and can really feel the difference.,1
Best price from local stores... Wife loves the way it takes care of her hair.,1
watery,1
"Does not smear, but does not give me the fuller lashes I like.  Good for gym days, not so great for dramatic look",1
"stinky.....if you like very strong perfume smells you will like this, but I just wanted a clean outdoors smell. I literally just threw it out after one spray.",0
The lotion softens your beard and helps prevent nicks and irritatiion. I use very sharp blades in my safety razor and this product helps. It is kind of a luxury though.,1
Best eyeliner ever!,1
not worth the money,0
"This is definitely NOT waterproof, and not long wearing. My NYX blushes last longer. The color is nice, but it fades super quickly and I do not have oily skin. I tried swimming with it once and it disappeared completely. Quite disappointed because it was almost $30 when I purchased it.",0
love it,1
This is my most favorite lotion.  It is thick enough for a hand lotion but not greasy.,1
I have thin hair.  I had hoped for volume but what I got was flat hair!  I've used Oribe products before and have been very happy.  This one just didn't work for me.,0
useless,0
It works!,1
Tiny size for price. Very small bottle. Not impressed,0
love it - just what I was looking for,1
"This product has a very unpleasant smell (somewhat chemical).  Also, there is so little ""tint"" to it that it really just works as a moisturizer (if you can stand the smell).  I will not be purchasing this product again.",0
Threaded stud snapped off the razor head after only 3 uses when I went to put it back on after changing the blade. I didn't over tighten it either? It snapped off with hardly any pressure on it. Not impressed.,0
Clips are inadequate for holding rollers in my hair. :P,0
I don't like the smell at all and it didn't seem to work very well for me.  I have been using a dry shampoo that I buy in CVS that works better and is cheaper than this one.,0
"I have not used this long enough to be a good reviewer, but so far so good.  It goes on smoothly, is not greasy, and does not feel heavy.  It's part of the morning routine.  I would buy this again.",1
"Unfortunately, this product caused breakouts on my chin. I now use it on my arms which have slightly dry skin.  A half hour later I notice it had not yet sunk in.  It was still oily.  Maybe if you have very dry skin you would be more pleased with it.",0
"As few reviews showed, this item is a hazard when defective. When it was being plugged into the outlet, it started sparking. I was denied a return after 30 day period , which coincidently the issues happened AFTER 30 days. DO NOT BUY",0
You really must learn how to use this before purchasing.,0
This item was disappointing. It was thick and hard to spread on the face. I love their pressed powder though.,0
"Ewg.org has a definitive guide on sunscreens. It states categorically that you should avoid Sunscreens with Oxybenzone. L'Oreal invented Mexoryl SX and this does not list it in the ingredients. I have not used it, but will not, or other Anthelios products, for that reason.",0
"Con:
Smudges throughout day...
HARD to truly clean off. I use the Neutrogena Cleansing wipes. Every time I wipe, I keep wiping off more liner. It won't completely clean off.
Clogged a pore on my eyelid and caused a sty! Never had that problem with other eyeliners.

Pro: glides on easily.",0
LEAVES STUBBLE.,0
I wore this with a hat while gardening yesterday and got a sunburn!  This stuff is junk.,0
Really good product.,1
It does not fit my hair dryer so i have not had the chance to use it.,0
"wasted my money could have done something else with the money I spent, was hoping this would work after spending money on laser hair removal which does work but can be very costly over a period of time so I purchased this item with positive hopes for sure, but after using it for 3 months straight with no success I was done with this product buyers remorse for sure!",0
Still too expensive.  About six dollars or so would be reasonable.  Product gives a very clean and refreshing feeling.  More like a soap than a traditional American toothpaste.  May buy occasionally but too expensive to be my everyday product.,1
"I assumed this would smell like green apple, but it really doesn't. It smells like the generic hand lotion they leave for you in hotel room bathrooms. Not too strong, but not too fabulous either. I would have liked a more distinct smell, but then again, some other people might prefer the nondescript scent of this lotion.

As a lotion, it is pretty great. Not too oily, but a deep enough moisturizing effect for dry hands. My office is terribly dry, so I keep it with me there and it has been great. It is definitely a tiny tube, though.",1
"I've used this product for a couple years and have seen good results. It's thick enough to moisturize and thin enough to not get too clumpy if I don't overuse. The initial bottle I purchased from a dermatologist office seemed fresher and easier to dispense than the last couple of orders on Amazon have been. I had issues with the pump and called the customer service number and was advised to shake the bottle and bang it against my palm a bit to break up air pockets. That seemed to work, though it is a pain to have to do that all the time. I've also seen an increase in the pilling of the product if I use too much at times. For the cost it would be nice to have a product that was fool proof and didn't need much effort to apply.  The main reason I stick with this product is that is does not make me breakout and that is an issue for me with most products.",1
Not impressed at all. Paint chips as normal... sveche tite is still my favorite.,0
Smells amazing but holy cow the price is no joke.,1
Worked nicely for about 2 months and then the bristles started falling out in excess daily. This caused the brush to be very uneven and not work as well. Spent waaaaay too much money for a brush to last 2 months!,0
"Got this item the other day and it was not tinted at all. The color is that of the original sunscreen (pale yellow). Luckily, I love using the original sunscreen but had wanted to try the bronze tint for something different during the dreary winter time. It'd be nice, as a long time customer of Amazon, that MD Skin Solution try to make things right with the wrong item sent, but I don't know what they'll do....",0
I touched the wrong star. I was very pleased with the purchase. My wife loves the fragrance. The rating should be 5 stars.,0
"Here are our top ten reasons you should not use anything containing SLS.
1. It is a known skin irritant. When cosmetic companies need to test the healing properties of a lotion, they need toirritate the skin first. What do they use to do this? SLS, of course. If you have dandruff, dermatitis, canker sores, or other irritated tissues or skin, it could be due to SLS.
2. It pollutes our groundwater.  It is toxic to fish and other aquatic animals and has the potential for bioaccumulation (meaning it accumulates in the bodies of the fish.)  It also is undetected in many municipal water filters, getting into the tap water that you drink.
3. It is actually a pesticide and herbicide.  It is commonly used to kill plants and insects. Makers of SLS recently petitioned to have SLS listed as an approved pesticide for organic farming.  The application was denied because of its polluting properties and environmental damage.
4. It emits toxic fumes when heated. Toxic Sodium Oxides and Sulfur Oxides are released when SLS is heated.  Makes a hot shower with an SLS shampoo seem not quite as nice
5.  It has corrosive properties.  According to the American College of Toxicity,  this includes corrosion of the fats and protiens that make up skin and muscle.  SLS can be found in garage floor cleanrs, engine degreasers, and car wash soaps.

6.  Long-term permeation of the bodys tissues.  A study from the University of Georgia Medicine showed that SLS had the power to permeate the eyes, brain, heart, and liver.
7.  Its an eye irritant.  It was shown to cause cataracts in adults, and is proven to inhibit the proper formation of eyes in small children.
8.  Nitrate and other solvent contamination.  Toxic solvents, including carcinogenic nitrates are used in the manufacturing of SLS, traces of which can remain in the product.
9.  Manufacturing process is highly polluting, emitting cancer-causing volatile organic compounds, sulfur compounds, and air particulates.

10.  It helps other chemicals get into your body.  SLS is a penetration enhancer, meaning that its molecules are so small they're able to cross the membranes of your bodys cells.  Once cells are compromised, they become more vulnerable to other toxic chemicals that may be with the SLS.
Does it cause cancer?
SLS is not a recognized carcinogen itself, but there is some truth behind those internet rumors.  When SLS is mixed with triethanolamine (or T.E.A) carcinogenic substances called nitrosames can form and be released.

"I am very, very thin on top.  This does help take the shine off my head.  As far as making it look thicker, I would say not.  Be careful with clumping...then it looks funny.  I mix the light brown with the med blond.  Blond looks green on me, but mixed with a little lt brown, it looks better.  Works best for me with the pump.  Takes a little practice, but still I would recommend this product.  I feel better about my hair and that is what counts.",1
This shampoo makes my hair look oily.,0
Love this stuff! I get dark circles under my eyes which requires me to wear concealer- this means my mascara has to be waterproof of it will run with my concealer. With blinc I can wear regular mascara that looks great without anything running!,1
"The problem with this Nail File is that it is CLEAR colored. So if you drop it on the floor it disappears from sight and is difficult to locate. The file itself is fine, but this should be colored so it isn't so easily lost.",0
"Omg! Im an Esthetician and I have been using Elta MD spf Tinted for the past 2 year.
Today I received my regular order for the month and I cant believe how ugly and different from all the others Ive used this is.
It leaves a very flacky look and I cant apply it.
Is this a fake???? Very disappointing",0
"I have had very dark circles under my eyes since I was a child and they have become darker with age.  I have searched for years for a concealer and this is the best one I have tried.  I have read some reviews that state that is is difficult to apply and does not look right.  I think it is great.  I apply it to the dark circle area and let it sit for a moment or two.  It kind of melts and becomes very smooth and easy to spread.  At this point, I pat it in and blend it out a bit.  It is advertised as more of a bruise concealer but since my under eyes are so dark I decided to try it.  I have used so many under eye concealers and thought I would never find one I really like.  I was wrong, I have found one and this is it.",1
Mannn this stuff smells good,1
Great solid black. Buy the matte also by OPI for a great combo,1
A little pricey but I absolutely love the color.,1
lasts forever,1
nice color,1
"This is very drying so if you have sensitive skin, use as a spot treatment. I have very sensitive/dry skin and use a full regime of Glytone. This is the only product I have to be carful with.",1
"I always use Evian when I fly.  My face just drinks it in!  Even though you close your eyes when you spray your face, your eyes will feel better.
Perfect size for regulations.",1
"I have the Shade 06--purple-- shadow duo and I love how the two colors blend together. Neither purple is too bright, even though they have a bit of shimmer to them.  (Which is fine since I'm rather conservative when it comes to makeup).

The shadow duo comes in an attractive case with a small mirror.  You'll need to have your own applicator.  I found this eyeshadow to be easy to apply and blend.  It doesn't cake or crease, but it barely makes it through to the afternoon after applying it in the morning.",1
"Do not let a great double edge razor intimidate you. There is a technique involved using this solid and well constructed German razor. Angle it so that the top of the razor touches your skin and you'll shave better. Also, it'll take a few passes going with, across and against the grain. Prep your face well (right after a shower is best) and use a good shaving cream like Taylor of Bond Street (I prefer Sandlewood) to experience the best results. With time and experience, shaving becomes a relaxed ritual instead of a dreaded chore.",1
"Best product!! I use Bioderma water sensitive and stumbled across this for my son. As I wanted to have him start learning to wash his face on his own (he is 8 and special needs and has super sensitive skin). This is a little bit different formula than the bioderma water for adults but much better. When my son is having aversions to bath, I use it all over to help keep him clean. It is a large bottle with an easy to use pump. And the price is amazing!! I bought one for the upstairs and downstairs bathroom and the whole family uses this product. I love this product, have used it for years, it is gentle on our sensitive skin. So excited to purchase this trusted product again and again!!!",1
This is a great product. It smells great and lathers quite well. I would have given 5 stars if it were a bit cheaper.,1
"Lasts longer than other top coats I have tried, but doesn't last a week on me.",1
Bleached/stained my favorite blue bikini a white and lime green color. Ruined it! Not worth it if it ruins everything it touches!!,0
NOT a serum.  I should have read more reviews before buying.  It was definitely a lotion and slightly greasy.  I returned,0
"I purchased this in ""Cameron"" and while I tend to like light nude lipsticks but this was quite chalky.",0
"I have been a long time customer and have regarded Amazon as a trustworthy place where I can buy products with confidence. However, I am disappointed and frustrated because I have purchased this exact product before at a salon and it was a completely different smell. I took the bottle I received from Amazon to a salon that carries Abba and compared the two formulas. Just as I suspected, the shampoo has a different smell and color to it. I noticed they changed their packaging but the formula is still the same. Just an FYI to anyone that has purchased it through Amazon- the shampoo I received from them smells STRONGLY like cherry alomd (very similar to Jergens) and the actual, authentic Abba brand is much more settle and smells nothing like it.",0
"This stuff is amazing. I can't see that it does much to lighten spots, but it is the ONLY thing that controls my rosacea. Amazon has by far the best price on it. I would pay almost twice as much if I bought it from my aesthetician. I hope Image never stops making it!",1
first time I went to use this conditioner it slipped out of my hand and the top broke off. I think better design would eliminate that. I am not sure if it will help my old fried hair or not but will come back to report on that.,0
"The Wife is a doctor, so we're not allowed out in the sun without protection.  But I hate the greasy quality of many sunscreens and lotions.

This product is especially good then in terms of disappearing once you apply it.  It also has a more subtle odor than many rivals.

On the other hand, the price is simply absurd.  Who is realistically going to pay $6 an ounce when similar products market for about $2 an ounce?",1
"This has not only made my redness worse and increased, but has caused me to break out in the areas I applied. Would return it if I could, will definitely not be purchasing again.",0
Quit after only 3 days....normally LOVE this brand!,0
Great!,1
Works good. You just have to go through about the whole bottle to see results. and I stoped using for a week and it was like I have never used it before.,1
"It does have decent hold, but it smells like toxic waste. I'm usually not very sensitive to smells, but this stuff is just awful. It does have some fragrance, but it's as though it's just there to try to mask the foulness. Kind of the porta-potty concept, to be blunt. Steer clear.",0
Works very well for those pesky breakouts women get every month.,1
"it was free on the same day arrival, but it didn't arrive as expected.  I received it the next day.",1
Love this stuff!!!  I have a fear of 'flat hair'....,1
"We all can agree this lotion is super expensive!
but is it worth it?
In my opinion.. yes!
I have been looking for a good face lotion that wouldn't go on all greasy, wouldn't leave a residue and would keep my skin hydrated and smooth. This product delivers what it promises. It is one of the only products out there that has it all.. AHA/BHA/Hyaluronic Acid/Glycerin/Green Tea and your main antioxidant Vitamins A, C, E. The only thing i wish it had is an SPF.. that would make it complete.

Though its on the expensive side, a small amount of this lotion will go along way, literally under a dime size will take care of your whole face! I recommend you purchase the item from the actual Menscience website, since they offer a money back guarantee..",1
"ABSOLUTE CRAP!!!!
NO shine/worthless!!!!!!!!  Manufacturer should be ashamed to sell this JUNK!!",0
"Nice little brush head. Seems to be working as far as clearing my face up. Can't say that the brush is directly responsible, but it is part of the system.",1
"My wife and daughter both love this and I have to say that I definitely see a difference in their hair. They both have long, naturally wavy hair but it usually tangles....at least they used to. Not any more. It also smells great, very clean and fresh. They also both blow their hair dry and I think this helps a lot to keep their hair healthier. Their hair looks healthier and feels smoother. They also said they don't use much, so a little goes a long way.",1
"I ignored the bad reviews on this item and ordered it anyways. I have a Babyliss Pro Nano hairdryer, so I assumed that meant it would fit. Nope. Not even close. I cant even wedge it on there with force.",0
"I just received this today. It looks and smells like the right product, but the order description says 8.45 oz and I received 4.25. Waiting to hear back from seller and will adjust review accordingly.",0
This flat iron works well. I just used it and my hair glided right through. As I recall the delivery could have been faster.,1
"Been using this since December and it's fantastic. No more dry hands. Goes on easily, dries quickly with no greasy feeling.",1
Great scent. I love it so much I spray it on my freshly made bed. It's a nice little touch.,1
Excellent product within very good results,1
I purchased the mascara a few years back and thought it was really good. Which is why I thought I would try it out again but deft not what I remembered. Not a great mascara your lashed stay together stuck and no volumne,0
Product arrived on time and as described,1
"Freaking Awesome, i love this stuff. it really works well. it gets the dead skin off of your lips. You must use it daily and it lasts for a long time. Very good product",1
Love it so useful,1
"Goes on extremely lumpy, you would think it was an old polish.  It's a shame because I usually love Butter Polishes.  Both colors themselves are pretty, but once applied, that's another story.",0
"*update*
Not sure if this was a knock off (Im seeing others post comparison photos, and Ive never bought this brand before I did however go to Sallys and the bottle is different!) but this polish has destroyed my nails. They are peeling, brittle and just awful. Never have my nails received this amount of damage from any polish. Will never buy cosmetics through amazon again as there are too many fakes being sold, and too many fake reviews to back them up. Pretty sure this was right through amazon, not a third party seller.

Purchased dulce de leche for a wedding. I thought the color was pretty hideous, but the naipolish itself held up well. I took it to a salon and they gave me a manicure. If you're using base/top coats make sure you use Opi brand as others didn't work with it. Held up for the 3 days i needed it to, without any cracking or chipping. I doubt Ill ever use it again. Im just glad we didn't have open toe shoes. 10 nails exposing this color was enough. Lol. (It wasn't just me. Even the manicurist said it was awful!)",0
"I really like this product -- the blue algae makes you feel like you're at the spa.  My only gripe is the price of the product.  I ask for this on my gift lists, but if I'm buying something myself, I'll settle for a cheaper product.",1
"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SAVE YOUR MONEY,
I've always used the treseme heat protectant spray (which I love), but i purchased this CHI heat protectant because i wanted to try something new. Boy did i make a mistake. This makes my hair SUPER STICKY whether my hair is dry or wet. When I apply heat to my hair with this heat protectant my hair turns crunchy and hard. My hair becomes super tangled as well and no amount of hair oil or even coconut oil can make my hair soft after using this. BUYER BEWARE!",0
"Smells just like WD-40. I love Proraso products, but this is really bad. I really wanted to like this beard oil. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.",0
Solid quality item.  Wife loves it.,1
"I don't understand the hype of this item. The shampoo is more like a detergent, has great lather and stripped the color in my hair. I did not notice a tropical scent. The products packaging is cheap too. I am not happy i paid $22 dollars for this, won't happen again. I don't mind paying for luxury , this doesn't come close to luxury..",0
I did not like this sunscreen at all. Leaves my skin flaky and does not hold in the water at all. It literally comes off in flakes after 15minutes.. ridiculous. I really wanted to like this.,0
"This color is very deceiving. I got it in the mail and it was pink so pink and sparkly, I though oh yuck pink.  I still decided to put it on and see how it looked. I really really like it. It is actually a light orange pink. Not true pink, thank God. The sparkles make it more a orange. For 5 bucks this was a good buy. I tried to get a picture of the color and it just looked bright pink. So think of a sparkly pink orange and this is the color. A very summer color, I have gotten tons of compliments..",1
it is not doing what it is suppose to do1,0
"Totally agree with other customers - WTH??? The stuff is great, but not for the amount they've jacked up the price! No thank you! I'll find somthing else =o(",0
"Love it! The texture is very nice, it works great and the scent is amazing",1
"The red was color was not dark enough for me.
I would like a darker red.",0
I am so pissed off to spend good money on that piece of crap. It dries patchy. It does not consistently cover lips! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,0
This is a very good product.  I wear it without any foundation as it provides sufficient coverage and  protects my skin.,1
"This is amazing for contouring. It doesn't look muddy on your face, no matter your color or complexion. It's really good.
It's a bit dark for anything else, though.",1
"Best lotion for pregnancy ever. I used it with my first and am currently 22 weeks with my second and have been using it with this one. Zero stretch marks and makes the ""stretch"" feeling not as painful. Highly recommend!",1
"I've never had a problem with Jane Iredale products, before this one. I ordered b/c I had received sample of this new product in mail. Sample received was much higher pigmented and of a different, more vivid color. Also, the product consistency of the full tub I purchased on Amazon...and sadly, will be returning is not same as sample. Giving you a much lighter color, that creases easily. So if you're buying based on sample, know they are very different. Both my sample and the tub I purchased was champagne.",0
Like it and can only hope it truly works!,1
This is THE biggest waste of money ever. It is an  empty bottle. Do NOT waste your money. First time I got ripped off on amazon.,0
"HAD SINCE FEBRUARY. LITTLE VOICE IN ME SAID I SHOULD GET AN EXTRA NECK. It broke. Little voice was right.  Really needs to be made of metal, not plastic. I've read elsewhere it was an issue. Design flaw. Other than that I like it. alot. See how support goes. they were closed today, a Friday. I thought that was unusual, although it is Labor day weekend coming up.

I'd have thrown it out if i didn't buy extra filters.

I just read that they won't cover it if you buy it through amazon.........wow! So I called amazon. They are refunding me for the item and the filters. I bought it 6 months ago, so I'm surprised actually. changing rating to 1 star for it.",0
Great at protecting hair. Not so good at keeping style. Overall I like that it gives my hair manageability. I use it every time I do my hair and it doesn't weigh it down.,1
This product arrived in a timely fashion and was exactly as I expected. Seriously? There is a word number requirement?,1
My husband loves this product.,1
great product.  Goes on easily and has staying power.  Pigment is good and product is buildable should you care to layer.,1
Not sure this is a real Clarisonic item? I tried to register my warranty and the website said the number I have is not valid.,0
"My skin seems to be a lot  smoother and clearer.
I feel the tingling sensation when applying the lotion which makes me feel like it's doing some good.",1
Great product,1
"I have been using these for almost a year, not as expected, but I will continue to try.",1
cap broke and can't close the container.  overpriced and not impressive.,0
"I loved this Hot brush Iron, it straightened my hair out perfectly with a little flip, the only problem I had with it is that the bristles kept falling out!!! I had to throw it away! I will not buy again because it was like throwing money down the drain. These are suppose to last longer then a year, you think???
It does get super hot though so be careful not to burn yourself.",0
"As a daily user of glycolic acid treatment pads I was very delighted to see Glycolixs pads with 20% glycolic acid.
I was thinking of stopping pad usage as I was unsure how much they were really working to keep my dull,shallow complexion at bay.  Then I saw this product at 20% (the ones I had been using were 10%) and figured I would give it a try and have been really happy with it.
PROS:  What I really like is the pads are very saturated - not at all like some of the other brands you buy that almost feel dry and as if there is little glycolic acid mixture to them.
CONS: The pads are thin and it is hard to separate the pads and often I was using 2 at a time.  One pad is thin but strudy and never had one tear on me so maybe it is just me.
I have recommended this product to friends who have been unhappy with other brands.  The price can not be beat either - want a grea daily glycolic treatment?  Try this one and I am sure you won't be disappointed",1
"I have ordered the Ahava salts in the past, but htis is the first time that I ordered the Eucalyptus salts.  I have been training for a marathon and been logging some long miles.  I feel like the salt helps sooth tired muscles.  The only downside is that the salt goes fast!  Probably a better value to buy the larger tub of salt.  Great product and pleased with the results.",1
"So far, it seems to be doing a good job.",1
"I love this lotion and have used it for years. This package arrived and when I opened it, the lotion was all over the inside of the bag - very messy and I had to wash off the entire bottle which was covered in lotion. The pump to the lotion bottle wasn't locked which makes me questioned if this product was new or had been used.",0
"I love this product- it's easy to apply and the color is perfect, but the liner stick falls out of the plastic holder after only a few uses and I keep having to replace it.  There must be a default in the way it's manufactured because it doesn't seem to hold the stick correctly, even when it's only rolled up slightly it ends up falling out.  I've had to purchase a new one every few weeks!

Honestly, I think maybe they manufacture it this way on purpose.  I emailed the company directly and they said it was not a known issue.  (um maybe they don't read their amazon comments!)  They didn't offer any type of make-good.  I love this product but it's frustrating that i have to reorder it constantly.  They really need to fix the construction!!",0
Wasnt the same smell as the original I bought from Macys... I think its a  similar  smell but no the real thing.,0
This is a good hairspray IF you can get the spray nozzle to work. I have wasted several cans after finding out the spray nozzle won't work. Looking currently for another hairspray which is really a shame because it is a great hairspray. Recommendation: Dont buy it.,0
Great smell. I had to apply more of this cologne than usual because it's very light,1
Felt very oily and it doesn't rub into the skin very well,0
"The Hot Tools Prof. 800 Watt Ionic Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is too hot on high and too cool on low/cool.
It is uncomfortable to use it.  I am not sure what my next step is going to be, but I cannot recommend
this product.",0
"I think it works fine but it smells like toothpaste. Disappointed over similar products, especially for the money.",0
Lid is broken,0
I love it,0
Havent tried it on my nails yet but it was useless for the Acetone/Syrofoam Experiment. Didnt try the Dry ice one,0
"Let me be perfectly clear... the product IS very good at what it does. The color matching is also very good... no complaints in that regard.  However, the reason I am giving Toppik the lowest possible rating is because of the outrageous price they are now asking for this product.  Let me state for the record that I paid $80 last year for a 1.94 oz. container.  The same container is now being offered for $115.  Well, guess what?  Toppik just lost me as customer as I will NOT be buying another bottle from them.  Luckily, there are other adequate ""hair fiber"" products on the market that compete directly with Toppik at a much lower price point.",0
Like puddsing,0
"I have bought this product more times than I can count. I usually am a one time product user as I like to try many products. However, I can't live without this. When I feel a pimple or breakout coming on I use nightly before bed on the problem area for a few nights in a row. Often times my breakout doesn't even occur. Other times it reduces the inflammation and severeness.",1
"I tried this pomade after using Sauvecito. I think I prefer Sauvecito's original hold because it's a little better on the hold. This one is good, but it doesn't hold my hair quite as firmly.",1
"I'm pretty sure the nailpolish I receive is fake. It doesn't look like the OPI I usually buy in stores (Amazon bottle is on the left, store bottle is on the right).
I got the sparkly princess color. The picture looked like a baby pink with subtle sparkle color I had received in a salon and loved, but in reality it's a hot pink with brilliant sparkles that is more fitting for a 5 year old.",0
Purchased two and both do not work as advertised. Does not get hot on the highest setting. Need a refund.,0
"I usually buy this from my hair stylist but she wasn't in town so I opted for a quick Amazon buy. This product stained not only my hands and nails purple, but my hair!! I have used this bottle 3 times just because I kept telling myself it won't happen again. It's so expensive I hate to waste it but I am not walking around with purple hair. So I bought something different at Target. Very disappointed this has never happened. I love milkshake products.",0
This stuff really works! My eyelashes are getting super long and that includes the bottom lashes too! My mom and my mother in law have gotten amazing results too!,1
Great product at a good price.,1
Nothing special won't buy again,0
"Great product, very soft on the skin. Smell is a weird combination of lime and fruity but works well, the gf loves it.",1
Really liked the texture and coverage of this cream but it just didn't match my face. I got the light medium and normally that would be the perfect match but I felt like this was darker than normal. Overall I think it would be a great CC cream but can't give a thorough review because I only used it a few times.,1
Product was great price but shipping took way too long,1
"Not really it's too greasy, which made my face greasy.",0
Stop your shave burns with this great product.  I also really like the Zirh shave Cream. I actually switch between the two and haven't had a razor burn in the last 2 years. Skin is soft and looks great. Try it and you won't regret it!,1
"I am a fan. However, I dropped the old one in the shower after a year or so of use, and it broke in a way that was not fixable. Sad! I have since purchased a new one, but I do wish there were some kind of warranty on it. I thought it would last much longer.",1
"I don't yet have significant balding, but enough, and it did the trick.
Friends and family said it looked good, not noticeable.
No residue on clothing and pillows, although when applying, you do have to be concerned about getting it exactly where needed.
Will continue using.",1
"I love the color. It has a purple hue but still in the pink/red category... very nice. No complaints, arrived with packaging intact... nail polish in plenty of bubble wrap. I have used it already. No clumps, no bumps. So happy I can order O.P.I. from Amazon...saves a lot of money and so many discontinued colors to choose from. I also order some for my sister in Texas...she loves O.P.I. as well. I have been using O.P.I. for 10 years. I feel it's the best. Always a smooth pretty nail with this polish.",1
It's good will buy again,1
Stained my pillows and sheets :(,0
Not sure it was the real thing. Too loose for a compact and the smell was different.,0
"I personally did not care for this shampoo. I have very fine, thin blonde hair and did not think the color protection nor the volumizer did much. I especially disliked how oily it leaves my hair. I generally wash my hair every other day, but had to was every day with this one.  The ingredients list 2 diff kinds of ""oils"" in them so be mindful if you have oily hair already.",0
"Dry, did nothing. Threw it out. Complete waste.",0
This is a nice concealer although a little lighter than I expected. It is a little dry and works better on oily skin. A little goes a long way.,1
"I got this as a gift literally 5 years ago and, as with any flat iron, the plates have been worn down a bit. However even after 5 years it's still the best flat iron i've ever used. I'm currently in beauty school and we got the Paul Mitchell Express Flat Iron in our kits and it doesn't hold a candle to this. It gets close to the root, the waves/curls I get with it are so wonderful, and it works so much better on extra curly hair. If you're thinking of purchasing it I highly recommend it",1
Not worth the price. Hard to get out of the bottle without a pump and not hydrating. I love Davines but this is a dud.,0
"I've used it before and love it, and the price was great!",1
I recieved the product shaken. Im so very much dissappointed. Please send me another one.,0
This hand lotion (not cream) hardly has any fragrance.,0
I might start out with the smaller strength and build up to this strength just to make sure it is right for your skin.  It caused some peeling on me and I do not have very sensitive skin.  Start slowly and build up.,1
The stain portion works OK but the gloss side just seemed empty.,0
Bought some of this from my hairdresser and really liked how it worked on my hair. Did a little research to see if I could get it cheaper and found it here.,1
love this stuff!!,1
Did not notice any decrease in hair.,0
"This has a skin irritating chemical called cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) so it will cause skin irritations on the baby and is possibly carcinogenic with its impurities. If your child has eczema or dermatitis, do not use this product. It has sodium myreth sulfate which is similar to laureth sulfate and also has fragrance so I would never use this on my baby and am throwing it away. False advertising by Mustela when it says ""Priority given to ingredients of natural origin.""",0
caboki is waaaaaay better,0
"Product comes out as a rust-colored granular ointment--not what the .5 oz. of this product looks like. I inquired if they had changed the product and this was normal, but it is definitely weird to put on this ointment that turns your skin orange. And, I'm concerned that what this color is is the oxidation of the retinol, which is susceptible to oxidation by the sun.

I haven't received an answer regarding the product and I don't want to use it, especially if (a) it turns my skin orange and (b) it is causing more oxidative damage to my skin than it already has!

This is not what I paid for.",0
"Using TALIKA Eyelash lipocils for years....GREAT.

Something really wrong with their Paris Eyelash Conditioing Creme.",0
"WOW! These are amazing!
First things first....there is no reasonable point in paying $35 for nail clippers. You can get many different types for less than $5. That being said, I would buy these again in a heartbeat!

They are beautiful and are one of the best engineered products I have ever seen.

1. They cut fantastic and are very sharp.
2. The design prevents nails from flying different directions. Just inside of the blades the area is shaped like a C and it keeps nails in place after being cut until you turn it on its side.
3. When folded/closed they are AMAZINGLY thin. The designers also made it so when the product closes for storage the cutting blades don't touch. There is about a 1mm gap between the blades. This allows slightly less tension on the metal plate that provides resistance when squeezing to clip a nail. This -should- increase product life because it doesnt fully extend the metal plate at all times when closed (similar to spring tension.)
4. They have tight (but not perfect) tolerances. To get any closer you would need to hand file the individual pieces.
5. There is a place to file your nails if you flip the clippers inside-out. It is small and can be difficult to use but the pattern works extremely well and will file your nails quickly. Plus, bonus to the designers for hiding this inside the alreay miniscule clippers.

In short, if you have any love for engineering and have some extra cash laying around to invest in nail clippers.buy them now!",1
Doesnt clean face. Wayyyyyyy to soft,0
"I have been using this since my daughter was about 7 months old and it is great for her Eczema. I will not be switching anytime soon, it is worth the price.",1
"I like the look and feel of it.  After it's on for a short while, it does seem to have a scent I don't like..., almost like a self tanner but not quite.

For the shipper or manufacturer, about 3 days worth had leaked out in shipping, so the pump somehow needs to be plugged or sealed.",1
"I'm not sure how all these positive reviews can be real. It looks like you threw dirt on your scalp. Tinted dry shampoo works much better. I'm sorry, but I just can't believe any positive results after trying the product.",0
"Very nice scent, got it for my wife. However, when the package arrived the cardboard was soaked from all of the oil in the scrub that had leaked out. They do NOT package these properly. The lid just doesn't quite fit the jar properly. I have never had a problem like this buying sabon products from a store or purchasing other products on the internet. I have gotten her several products like this over the years. I would recommend any of them, except for this one. I would recommend purchasing directly from Sabon website rather than through amazon. The only reason I did was so that my wife wouldn't see a package that says Sabon on it and immediately give me away. I think she kind of got the idea when the room was filled with the scent of the spilled oil though.

If you read other reviews you will see that a lot of people have had this problem with this product. If you decide that you just have to have this product, make sure it is shipped separately, because oil will get on everything else in the package.",0
The color was the best but this product does not last with the color one to 2 days that is it don't waste your money!,0
"This works well, the only thing I would mention that gives it less stars is the tip is hot. It should be insulated like all the other curling irons. It is hard to curl my hair and not touch it",1
"I got a super sized sample from sephora with my rewards points of this Juice Beauty Stem Cellular CC Cream. (Enough that I have been using it as my foundation every day for the past 2 weeks.) I do think there are a few pros to this product, but I just didn't like it. And here is why:

Yes, it does give decent coverage for a CC cream. That is the best part about the product, but I can find another product that has good coverage and not as many negatives as this one did for me. I also liked the refreshing and light smell of the product.

Cons: I couldn't stand how thick and heavy this felt on my face. It was goopy and sticky for probably 25 minutes after I put it on. And then after that initial sticky feeling left my face, it still felt really heavy. I can't stand sticky and heavy feeling foundations and this was only a CC cream so it didn't even have as much coverage as a foundation. No thank you. I have been using the Lumene Age freeze CC cream and I have been loving that, so I would recommend giving that a try. It's cheaper too.",0
The worst curler I ever owned. My hair gets straight after an hour or two! I curl my hair with my flat iron and that lasts 4-5 hours!,0
This color is very beautiful.  I am so happy I found it since OPI does not carry it anymore at participating stores.,1
no use at all,0
I brought this product for a friend and apparently this is awesome and works great for short period of time may be for 3-4 hours,1
"I bought this thinking it would cause my husband less itching but it never did. It does itch less, but not completely.",1
"I was completely allergic to this product and my face broke out in hives a few hours after using it. The product texture, smell and color seemed off. The color was sheer, not bronze like I expected, and I suspect this was either an expired bottle past it's shelf life or a knock off. Second time having bad luck with this vendor. Next time I'm buying this in the store.",0
This is my second time!!! Same problem again!! The top heater doesnt work after I used for few times,0
Didn't like that it doesn't have heat setting options.  Loved the size though.,0
"I bought it really thinking this was the real Olaplex and THIS DID NOTHING TO MY HAIR. Then I decided to go to Sephora to buy the same product and compare, and the Olaplex from Sephora is almost a miracle to my hair.

"Of all the Lacoste Essential products, the deodorant holds it scent the longest.",1

"While I wanted to LOVE this stuff, as it smells amazing, and who doesn't want a hydrated face, I got a hive the first night I used it. My face also felt a bit sticky/tacky after it dried. When I checked the ingredients, propylene glycol was listed as second ingredient. PG is not to be used near eyes or as a mist, see info straight from wikipedia, bummer, I really wanted this to work!

""Undiluted propylene glycol is minimally irritating to the eye, producing slight transient conjunctivitis; the eye recovers after the exposure is removed. Exposure to mists may cause eye irritation, as well as upper respiratory tract irritation. Inhalation of propylene glycol vapors appears to present no significant hazard in ordinary applications.[33] However, limited human experience indicates that inhalation of propylene glycol mists could be irritating to some individuals.[34] It is therefore recommended that propylene glycol not be used in applications where inhalation exposure or human eye contact with the spray mists of these materials is likely, such as simulated fogs for theatrical productions, or antifreeze solutions for emergency eye wash stations.[35]""",0
Don't waste your money. Any concealer from any simple drug store would work just as well and not cost you 20 bucks. There are tons of concealer products on the market. I expected better from DermaBlend.,0
Excelent products,1
I know everyone's computer screen is different but this is a RED color. Now i love red but I like blue/red burgandy side. On my screen it looks like a dark pink/raspberry color. Gave it to my daughter.,0
"Purchased for my elderly mother who constantly laments her thinning hairline. Although this is obviously a superficial solution, it does make her feel like she has more hair in front. A little tricky to apply (it is a fine powder, afterall), and tends to get all over the place. But used judiciously, desired results can be achieved with some practice. Not sure if she will repurchase, but at least for now it offers an easy solution for bald spots. It basically just colors your scalp like shoe polish, doesn't really thicken fine hair as claims.",1
"It's really runny and has a greasy film.  I'm usually happy with all of their products, this one is a miss.",0
This didn't work very well,0
"This has talc in it. Why put talc in it?  I found it to be messy, and I personally do not want talc in my products. As far as it's performance, I didn't really notice anything. The price was right so I bought it. I won't again though. I'm surprised I didn't catch the fact it has talc in it. I usually look up everything. Honestly all ingredients should be displayed on the product page.",0

I thought it would be their regular size bottle but it was a tiny sample bottle,0
There is NO smell to this. I received it in my Birchbox originally. I ordered it from Amazon and it's basically water. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,0
"This is a body splash, not a perfume. Unless you have tried this fragrance, you might not find it pleasing. It reminds me of an old-fashioned Avon perfume.

"I've used a full catalogue of Elemis products for over a month and am leaving reviews on each one:

The Camellia Oil is one of the few Elemis products I'd actually recommend. It has little to no added fragrance and is absorbed well by my hair and skin.

Additionally, the price for this product is much more reasonable than other elemis products.",1
Didn't help,0
"Does not work well on thick , color treated hair",0
Did not work very well for me at all.  So many good reviews too.  I think even hair conditioner worked better than using this.,0
"I bought this product directly thru Supergoop website.  I thought the concept was great for the purpose of refreshing your sunscreen throughout the day.  I bought it before a trip to Palm Springs.  I am so disappointed.  I have tried it on three different occasions.  First of all, it is extremely oily.  If you get any on your hair it is sticky and hardens like hair spray.  Also, I experienced a burning feeling and after two days of use, and my skin felt chapped, skin was very dry.  As one other reviewer said, this is my regret purchase.  I have decided to bring it to the breach and use is as a spray sunscreen for my legs just to use it up.",0
"I loved this hairdryer while it worked. The first month it started to make a strange sound. It seems like some sort of belt. I shrugged because it still functioned. Five months later, I'm drying my hair, and the noise gets scary loud. I unplug the dryer and can feel that something is sliding around inside the unit. It sounds gravelly. It seems as though something came apart. Five months of usage at this price point is depressing.",0

"These pore cleaning strips are comparable to the Biore product, with one major difference.  These smell really bad.  Another reviewer described it as ""chemical smell"", but it is a heavy perfume scent.  It scent might not matter with a product that was used elsewhere on your body, but it was too much be bear having it taped on my nose.  The humidity was really low the day I tried them, so they dried quickly.  I could not have tolerated the smell if they had taken a minute longer to dry.

 Even worse I couldn't get the smell to wash off my nose afterwards, so I had to put up with the smell for the remainder of the day.  This is not a pleasant scent either.  It smells like the worst cheap perfume you can imagine.  My best guess as to why the product's designers decided to add the scent is because black heads are black because the oil in the clogged pore has oxidized, which can cause the gunk removed to smell rancid.  The stupidity of this is that you throw the strip in the trash afterwards, so what it smells like is of no consequence.  Perhaps they thought some customers might want to start a collection saving their old strips as a hobby, so they added the heavy scent for that purpose. ;-)

I decided to try them because I had read a review that said they were more effective than the Biore strips.  I can't say that I noticed any difference in the gunk removed, and they cost about the same as the Biore strips.  I'm going to trash the remainder of the ones I bought and go back to Biore strips.",0

"My curls don't last as long as they have with other curling irons I have used. It does heat up fast and the swivel cord is a great feature. But, there is no automatic shut off on this. I think it's crazy that is not a built in feature on all curling and flat irons. At this point it's such a a simple safety feature that can prevent a lot of  potential problems. That is my biggest complaint.",1
"Packaging is eye catching and upscale looking. Bottle design is very pretty for display on vanity top - star design is plastic rather than metal. Spray application disperses over a 2-3"" area with even coverage. Scent is lively and fun, changing over time before fading to very light 8 hours later.",1
Wasn't impressed with what it promises.  My polish did not stay on any longer by using this product.,0
"I have used GHD flat irons for a few years now because I needed the universal voltage option as they used to be one of the best brand out there.
 Unfortunately, the GHD keep breaking  down after the warranty expired and I wanted something new more reliable.
My hairdresser started carrying the Cloud 9 flat irons and because it's has an universal voltage option I decided to get one and see whatit  is all about.
I  tried to do some research before buying it but there was not much available on the market at that time...
I like the plastic protector  and the temperature control  but I completely dislike the plates. Their ""secret ingredient "" doesn't work at all as the plates don't glide through the hair smoothly as the GHD ones and it doesn't flip my hair as easily as the GHD(I tried 2  flat irons as one broke down and I received another one under warranty).It gets stuck at the end of my hair and if I am not careful I could easily burn my hair. On top of this after a week of using it my hair got dryer and looked frizzy... The style doesn't last as long over the day as with my GHD either. I have no issues like that with the GHD.
I had high hopes as it was created by former GHD people but I would not recommend spending the money for this flat iron.
I liked the warranty procedure as I got an exchange on the spot for the broken one(it broke down 3 months after purchase) but it feels like a cheap drug store model not like a $300 one(this is how much it costs in Canada...),
 It also doesn't come with a travelling case that protects the flat iron(it has just a cloth bag :-)) so I had to use my GHD one for travelling. It comes in one colour only too......

I am considering buying an Sultra Seductress as a back up flat iron for traveling now as even if I have the Cloud 9 as a backup I find myself avoiding it and using the GHD most of the time.",0
"My husband hates oils, lotions, conditioners, chapstick... Anything that feels like that on his skin (has since he was a baby).
This is WAY better then most sunscreens for him.  He doesn't love it, but compared to all the others this is the best we have found.  He even forgets its there after about 1/2 hour which is a huge improvement.

Works great to as he is a ginger and burns easily.  Lasts a few hours usually in strait sun and lots of heat.",1
This item did not work for a month before it lost ability to charge.  Total waste of over $200.,0
"This ""Paste"" smells a lot like sweet pipe tobacco so it's on the manly side.  It holds a woman's short hair in place too but you will smell the tobacco scent everywhere you go.  I just got my hair cut nice and short and since hubs is at work right now I thought I'd give it a try.  It definitely will hold your hair in place with a minimal amount, but I sure can smell it.  I like the scent of pipe tobacco but after a while I may have to wash it out.  Hubs tried out the 18.21 Pomade yesterday and it smells a lot like this paste.  So, either one will hold your hair pretty much all day but the scents are rather strong.",1
My most using curling wand,1
The result is not natural looking. Not sure what it does other than make my polish thicker.,0
Loved how it made my hair feel but the scent is awful.,0
"This is a great foundation that was really lightweight and easily blendable.  It went right into my wife's skin, and she loved the fact that it felt silky.  It combined excellently with the VINCENT LONGO Water Canvas Blush, and came in a small & convenient compact that was easy to throw into my wife's bag.

The line has a lot of colors, but the bisque seems to be one of those colors that could work for a lot of different women.

The only downside to this was that when applied with a foundation brush (as recommended) but without using Vincent Longo Water Canvas primer (recommended for longevity) it evaporated.  My wife is going to try using this with the primer to see if it really does last longer, but without it, by the end of the day it had evaporated to the point where she had no makeup to take off (which could be a bad thing).

It's such a lightweight coverage, it's easy to see this being someone's goto everyday makeup.

Oh, and it's a bit chinsy for this to come without an application sponge and make users order that separately.",1

"My daughter had severe razor bumps. She was on a steroid cream for 6 months & couldn't tolerate products like Nair. So we decided to give the Tria 4x a try to get her off of the steroid cream. My daughter has a medium skin tone (she's half Italian & Scottish, Welsh, Dutch mix on my side) & dark hair so she was the ideal customer. We've done a weekly session on the #5 setting for 6 weeks now on her upper legs only. We used Greencaine at first to numb the legs but it's VERY expensive! We tried Alocane & it worked just as well & at much more reasonable price. Both numbing gels worked for her. After 6 sessions (once a week) we have seen great results! Her hair is not growing back as much or as fast. What does grow back is now blonde. This is to be expected according to the literature.

My only complaint is that the head of this instrument is entirely too small for anything other than the face or underarm. We do the back of her legs (20-25 minutes) then have to recharge the Tria (1 hr) &... Read more",1

"The item, though from a very respectful company, is rather below the average quality: cheap can, no foaming, etc. Very disappointing, wish I could return the item, but Amazon policies prohibit the return.",0
"I was skeptical at first, even in light of the good reviews, that I should buy this product.  It was quite expensive compared to many other products claiming to remove razor bumps.

The thing is, this is the first product I've actually used that works really well.  Lots of cheaper products only work partially, and if you stop using them, the bumps come right back.

I've spent twice the price of a bottle of this on numerous $5-10 dollar products that didn't work as advertised.  This is worth your money.  Use it twice daily for a week and you will see what I mean!

Obviously, you have to shave carefully or, as soon as you stop using this, the razor bumps will come right back.  But this product will really help keep them away!

Additionally, the stuff lasts forever!  You only need to apply a very small amount so 2.5 ounces will last several months.",1
"I am super unimpressed by this product.  It hasn't affected my skin at all, positively or negatively.  I guess it feels good.  It holds a charge well.  But I haven't noticed any difference.

"Hard to understand the rave reviews for this product.  I have thick, curly, rather frizzy hair.  This cream does help with the frizz but it's quite drying.  It isn't greasy but I didn't find it alt all moisturizing, either.  After using the cream with the Love conditioner for two weeks my hair was like straw.  It is dry anyway but the Davine products made the dryness worse.  Both products have an unnatural scent and are full of weird chemicals.  The label reads: ""With almond extract from Mr. Assenza's farm, Syracusa, Italy.""  That doesn't make the Davine line natural. Many hair care products contain some almond oil, and it doesn't matter where the almonds are grown.  Nearly every other ingredient listed on the curl enhancer cream is some five-syllable chemical.  The Love conditioner irritates my eyes badly after I rinse it, which cannot be good for me.  i bought the Davine products during a moment of weakness on a bad hair day and regret the $65.00 I dropped on them.  I might use them once in a while or just throw them both out.  It's back to John Masters--which really is a natural line.",0

Doesn't look so great. I thought that my lashes should be all long by now. I'm worried that some have broken off too! Should I give it more time?

EDIT: I was wrong. This stuff is great! You just need to give it more time. Its been 3 months and all I could say is wow I have long lashes and a little fuller but. They do look fake. My friend gets extensions and she's like you lashes look unbelievable now she just ordered some. My lashes are still blonde though. So they didn't get darker but with mascara they really really stand out. Sometimes its a little too much. My bottom lashes are sooooo long too. I highly recommend.

I have coarse, dry, wavy hair, and I love to use this on the first day I shampoo because it tames the fuzziness and adds some nice body and control.  However, by the 2nd or 3rd day post-wash I can't use it because it is pretty weighty and doesn't do anything for my hair.  Then I switch back to the old texture cream/conditioner/oi oil combo.  But for what it is, it works great.",1
"This product is very watery (thin) and doesn't moisturize very well. Because of this, fortunately, it's not very greasy, but still, I expected a richer lotion. Another problem is it stinks like cologne. If I want to stink like cologne I'll spray some on. They should tone that down.",0
This is the best dry shampoo on the market. My blonde hair is sensitive to product and it always works like a charm. Other dry shampoos leave my hair feeling oilier and weighed down but this is the BEST by far. Dont waste your money on ten different cheap dry shampoos.,1
"First Impression...
I have found out that the LORAC brand, as a whole, is all very high quality and well-made cosmetics. The LORAC Multiplex 3-D Lip Gloss es are no exception! And their packaging is awesome! I really enjoyed the sleek and polished look they give their products. And, considering how small lip glosses normally are, LORAC really gives you a lot in this tube. Which is something I appreciate -- as when I splurge on a high-end product, I want it to last for a while. :-)

The Product...
LORAC Multiplex 3-D Lip Gloss is incredibly thick, creamy, and pigmented. The color I received was 'Intermixed', and it's a beautiful peachy/rose-gold kind of color that would really compliment those with fair skin. Since I have rather olive-toned skin, this lip gloss really didn't enhance or brighten my lips, since they are naturally almost this exact shade. But when I watch it apply, it's easy to see that the color is really rich and thick. So if you have really pale lips, this will enhance them beautifully and give you a gorgeous shine! There isn't too big a smell to these glosses. It definitely has one, but it's very subtle -- you have to get right next to the gloss to smell it. It's a very pleasant, floral kind of scent.

The Application...
The applicator on the LORAC Multiplex 3-D Lip Gloss is really pointed, as you can see in the picture, which gives you amazing accuracy when applying this to your lips. The bristles are pretty firm, too, which keeps you from making a mess. For me, personally, when I apply lip gloss I like to, at first, put it on with the applicator, but then blend it out with my finger. I feel it just gives it a really natural, smooth look that I personally prefer. And LORAC Multiplex 3-D Lip Gloss works great for that. There isn't a taste to the gloss, that I noticed. I have a habit of licking my lips, and I never noticed a particular taste, besides it feeling thick and stick. ;-As for how long this gloss lasts...not really long. I apply it in the morning, before going to school, and it'll wear a bit as I drink water or lick my lips (habit!). By lunch time -- after I eat -- pretty much all traces of the gloss are gone and I'd have to reapply. So the longevity of the product isn't that great. For for a gloss, I'm really not expecting it to last for hours, so that didn't bother me.

Major Likes...
The pigmentation is awesome and I really liked the applicator on this one! I almost forgot to mention, but the gloss container almost has a spring action to it, when you twist it open. I don't know how it works, but as soon as you twist it open, it'll rise up out of the bottle by itself, all ready for your lips with a full applicator tip. Great perk, in my opinion!

 Major Dislikes...
Probably the biggest thing that I noticed with the LORAC Multiplex 3-D Lip Gloss is the 'sticky' feeling of the product. After I apply it on my lips, whenever I would press them together, I would get that really tacky/sticky feel. And for me, personally, I really don't like the feeling. If this isn't an issue with you -- or it's something you look for in a lip gloss -- than you don't have to worry about any cons with this product! :-)

Final Thoughts...
While I really liked this product and thought the quality and pigmentation was awesome, I don't think I would personally purchase the LORAC Multiplex 3-D Lip Gloss for myself -- solely because I have the odd quirk of not liking tacky/sticky stuff on my lips. But, honestly, if that wasn't an issue, I'd be all over this lip gloss!! I'm really thinking of giving another of their lip glosses a try -- in a different color -- and maybe it won't have that tackiness to it. I loved how pigmented the gloss was. If I got a darker shade, I don't think I'd really need a color underneath -- if I was going for just a day time look. It'd give enough color with just the gloss itself!

So, all in all, if you don't mind the sticky feeling in a lip gloss, I'd highly recommend you give LORAC Multiplex 3-D Lip Gloss a try! You won't be disappointed in the packaging, consistency, application, or pigmentation. A wonderful, high-quality lip gloss, that's for sure!

"The Merkur safety razor is well balanced in one's hand while shaving and provides a close, comfortable shave. In summary it performs exactly as one expects from a razor.",1
I saw no change..lip gloss is very shiny. Over rated,0
"Are you kidding me? This expensive item made my hands and fingers turn rough, and the smell is terrible.",0
I've been using this brand and shade for about a year.  It works well over my foundation but I can't wear it solo due to my skin needing a base or just looks flaky.  One of these lasts quite a long time.  I wouldn't have had to order this one so soon but I dropped my other and 'oops' it cracked to pieces.  I would definitely recommend any Jane Iredale products.,1
"It's gentle on the hands and smells fabulous.  It would be a five star, but for the cost. . . . .",1
"Be sure to check if this product is tinted or not, I thought it was.",0
This nail polish is wonderful since it doesn't contain the harmful chemicals many American polishes do. Thee packaging was a little crushed thus why I took one star off but the product itself was great! I had intended to hive this as a gift but I kept it for myself great buy!,1
"I'm not quite sure if it's doing what it's supposed to (this is my first time trying this, but I find it unusually watery), but this stuff stinks up to high heaven!!! Lol. With this size, you'll never have to buy it again, and honestly, I probably wouldn't because of the smell haha",0
OMG this is the best one that i have ever gotten.  love the feel of the handle. I'm not afraid it's going to slip out of my hands into the sink. It dries very nicely also. I would have to thank my sister-in-law for telling me about this air dryer. She has it and loves it too.,1
"I've been using the Stila liquid eye liner for more than 2 years now and it's still my favorite. The tip makes it super easy to apply straight and sharp lines. I use it everyday and one pen usually lasts around 6 months. If you properly cap the pen, you should have no issues with the pen drying out. Make sure you apply the eyeliner to a clean skin with no lotion or else the line you drew will become flaky and uneven. Definitely one of the most reliable eye liner in the market.",1
Item was great...works perfect for what I needed very satisfied.,1
Bought the dryer in may 2017 and LOVED it. MY hair came out fluffy and smooth.  Sadly like some others in less than a year (April 2017) the hot air stopped working and no warrenty.  Not worth what I paid if it only lasts a year. #Disapointed,0
Nice color but patchy. It feels good on the lips thou,0
"pros:  smells great, cleans great

cons:  Fells like sand paper, way too much mint, makes eyes water.",0
Lasted only one week. Not enough product to justify the cost.,0
Love to use this alone on my hair when I'm on vacation and let it air dry.  It smells like heaven and leaves it with nice texture without any stiffness or crunchiness.  My hair is straight but when I twist it and leave it to air dry it leaves nice waves.,1
Soooo expensive for just 1 packet!,0
"Juicy Couture Viva La Noir Eau de Partum is marketed for evening & special occasion wear.  It boasts that it will embody the woman who is dangerous - but in a good way.  While I'm not quite sure what that means, I can say that a little spray of this Juicy partum will grab you by your senses and will continue to provide a strong scent for quite a long time - even if the skin area gets wet.

Scent-wise, this partum is suppose to have floral top notes and vanilla & candlewood lower notes.  I expected to smell more mandarin (dangerous, right?), but my nose says gardenia & vanilla come through the most.

If you are a Juicy fan, then you know what scent you are purchasing and how the scent interacts with your body. For those buying without smelling, this Juicy scent is a very sweet, floral/vanilla scent more than a musky mandarin scent.",1
"I bought myself a M-P brush 32 years ago.  I still have it, and use it every day.  The brush is just as good as the day I bought it.  If you take care of it, I have no doubt it could last a lifetime.  Yes, they are costly, but I figure it has cost me $2-$3 a year based on what I paid for it.  You would spend far more on a cheaper brush every year or so.

This product feels so good and works so well.  It really improves the appearance and shine of the hair.

So if you are debating whether a brush is worth this much money, the answer is YES!",1
"Within 36 hours of using this product, I had a very bad reaction. My skin started to get dry and scaly with lots of raised bumps. It actually looks like my skin is thicker. My skin looked about 10 years older. It was very dry and itchy. It's been about 6 days since I used it and things are starting to get better. I tried moisturizing and that didn't seem to help. Yesterday, I put neosporin on it and that finally seemed to help. No idea what could cause this but I'm so glad I didn't try to continue to use this product. The symptoms have persisted for so long!

UPDATE: It's been 9 days since I last used the product (used it for 3 applications total) and my eyes still burn and are red. I just tried to take make-up off and I felt like I was rubbing my skin raw. I can not wear make-up again until this is resolved. Aside from the itching and swelling, it burns as if I've gotten a bad sunburn on my eyelids. Ugh. I called the dermatologist and they recommended hydrocortisone cream until this resolves. I hope it will!",0
Gives lots of body and bounce and does not leave a sticky feeling.  Have used a gel for years and really like the change it's made in  my hair.,1
Good,1
"Effective, but very thick and the shade options are limited and don't suit my skin tone.",0
The quantity is not exactly as stated.,0
"I've been using it for 2 months and don't really notice any changes in eyelash length and volume. I try to be consistent by using it every night or every morning... I probably skipped a few days but never more than 2 days, so always 6/7 days out of the week.

What I noticed is my eyelid area and under eye circles are getting darker? Not absolutely sure if it has to do with the Grand Lashe or not, but it's quite noticeable and I have to put powder on my eyelids now. Before I never had to do that. Just wanted to see if anyone else experienced that.

I'm still using it and waiting, will update again.",0
"Product smells old and is slimy. I have been using this stuff for years, and it should not have this smell or consistency:(",0
"Sometimes my hair is such a pain in the tuckus, what with frizz and going into wonky directions, that I couldn't resist trying out LumaBella's hair straightener with its cool mist feature. The packaging is nicer than most straighteners I've gotten in the past, and has a magnetic close box, for cardboard! So, yeah, that's a dorky, unnecessary thing to be excited about, but so be it. Anywho, it comes with two of their macadamia conditioning oils to fill the reservoir (you only need less than one at a time), plus I like that distilled water can be used if I'm low on funds. I used it on its lowest setting, which are just lit up circles, and only one pass and it was straight as I needed. While it's a little bulkier than I'm used to, it wasn't as hard to wield as I thought it might be. I did worry a little about the sizzle I heard the first time and then a sizzle when I used the cool mist, so that does give me pause. Does that mean it'll eventually dry my hair out? Or am I just paranoid? Only time will tell. But, ohmygerdz, was it soft after that! Holy heck, it was probably about 60% softer. So I am overall happy with the Lumabelle and will keep using it as my main straightening iron for the time being.",1
There is no shampoo better than this shampoo and conditioner.  I am a swimmer and put my long hair through the mill with my daily swim of 2 1/2 hours.  My hair was feeling like straw (really) and pureology saved my hair.  I will always be 'totally devoted' to this stuff!  My hair is soft and strong once more.  It is better than the stuff specifically made for swimmers... it is the best.  The smell is great and it is really worth the money if you want the best (besides you use very little anyway).,1
"I thought I was getting a great deal, but it turns out there is NO perfume in the bottle, only alcohol.  Amazon's return policy prevents me from returning this item. So, now I have a $35 bottle of alcohol, and I can't even drink it.",0
great product fast delivery,1
Used this shampoo for many years really like it,1
"This product was just ok as well.  I use both, the lotion and toilette spray, every morning and the scent is gone in an hour or two at the most.  I won't order this again.",0
"The color is good on my skin, although a bit tan. I'm half Asian and half Armenian and would say my skin is beige/tan. The coverage seems fine but I still prefer Burnout because of the high zinc content (doesn't leave me with a strong white cast either). I don't think La Roche-Posay blocked the sun enough as my hyper pigmentation spots appeared darker after using this for a couple of weeks.",1
"MAKE SURE you look at the product size before you order. It's a great product, but I paid what is fair for the 3.5 oz size and received the 0.35 oz size.  It's tiny, and overpriced. Ridiculous, whoever priced it ought to be ashamed!",0
2nd time ordering.  It does smooth out my hair.  if you use too much your hair can get greasy so use very little,1
"love the smell, and helps to prevent my hair from drying out from the sun and ocean",1

AVERAGE Product,1
"I got this color during a pedicure recently and was so sad when it was time to change the polish, so I had to get a bottle for myself! It's a perfect shade right between pink and red, and OPI always holds up well.",1
"The glycolic facial cleanser does what it says in leaving a squeaky clean face. Most notably, I noticed shaving after washing my face with this cleanser felt smoother, less irritating and the hairs were softer.

I've been using the cleanser for over a year and the two reasons for not giving it 5 stars are:
1. There does not seem to be an appreciable lather. While this does not affect it's effectiveness, it takes some getting used to if you're accustomed to rich lathering cleansers or heavy shave creams.
2. I've found the cleanser changes texture over the course of using a bottle unless you remember to gently shake before each use.

Overall, I highly recommend this cleanser. I continue to use it and I'm upset when I run out and haven't remembered to order a new bottle before the old one runs out.",1
"I seem to see an improvement after only a week of use in the furrows between my brows and the corners of my mouth. I'll keep using this because nothing else I've tried has made such a change so quickly.

edited: I took a star off because the change was limited. You can probably get the same effect with an alpha glycolic acid cream for much less money.",1
"After two years of use, the tightening screw separated from the top plate. My razor is now unusable! I'll update this review to 5 stars if Amazon/Merkur makes an adjustment on a new one as I love the shave.",0
I actually use this as bath oil.  It foams a bit and makes my bath and body smell great and moisturizes as well.,1
We love it!!!  Great price!!  Thanks!!,1
I love the Replenix cream but I didn't realize this was the serum / gel.  I gave it a try and it just leaves my skin sticky and stiff.  Yuck.,0
0 STARS for the seller and 1 star for the FHI flat iron. Does not heat evenly. Results similar to $15 flat iron. Disaster of a transaction,0
"I loved the product it replaced.  This is less expensive, so I'm sure the ingredients are not as good.  Did nothing for my hair and the container is very difficult to use in the shower. A Tube  would be much better. Although I like other Onesta products, I won't buy this again.",0
"I don't have a lot of experience with cuticle removers, so I would say this is pretty good,, based on my expectations of what a cuticle remover should do.  It makes removing all the extra skin off of your nail bed pretty easy, and makes your cuticles soft.  One thing I have noticed is that it dries out after a short period of time.  By the time I am done working on my left hand and am ready to move on to my right, I feel like I need to re-apply to keep my cuticles on the right hand soft enough to do anything with them.  That's why this is 4 instead of 5 starts.

Other than that (and it may be just me), I would say this is a decent product.  I still have a ton left, so even though it is slightly expensive, over time the price will even out, since you really don't use all that much.",1
Ok but too strong of a smell for me.  And didn't feel any lasting effects.  Would not recommend.,0
"I didn't realize I was ordering a traveling size when I ordered this.  Its price compared to the 10.5 oz.  When I am shopping I didn't even think a travel size would be this price.  I did fail to read the size, but I am sure I am not the first to read 10.5 instead of 1.5.  I only kept it because I can use a travel size and didn't want to go to the trouble of shipping it back.l.",0
"After using Indie Lee rosehip cleanser for about 2 years.. I wanted to try something a little more gentile. Well I bought this incredibly expensive face wash with the hopes that it would be a nice substitute, but unfortunately it has made me break out around my temples and forehead. So bummed and can't return a 55.00 bottle of face wash. If you are prone to breakouts I would suggest you try something different.",0
I can stop wondering about lash extensions. This mascara really does what it says and stays put.,1
"I am disappointed with the seller of this great product. They have tripled the price and the quality of the product seems to be altered. It is either old or watered down. I bought this from a Salon, and it was wonderful for my thick hair. Soften my hair and the conditioner really help with dry ends. Now I don't know what I am putting on my hair.",1
This color is so much darker and not near as sparkly as it appears online.,0
"I was expecting this product to rival or exceed my Clarisonic.  It does not. It has a very slight vibration, even at the highest.  I don't feel that it does the job intended.",0
Brightens red hair and adds copper highlights,1

"I wanted a good mid-blue and this is so dark it is almost black therefore I am not using it, it is just sitting in my make-up drawer.",0
"Great soap for oily skin, you can wear it twice a day and soon you will notice that your skin its less oily.",1
"These are the best tan towels ever.  They have a great color on my white skin.  They are not orange at all.  It's actually a really good ""tan"" color.  Very very natural and you use them a couple of days in a row to get your desired color.  I put mine on at night and wake up in the morning and you can see a couple shades darker there.  To maintain, you use them about every two or three days.  Super easy.  You wash your hands after you put it on and there's no color stain.  I put them on in a circular motion and it's always gone on very even and smooth.",1
"My husband got this for me, when I said I wish there was a Crabtree & Evelyn store near us. I loved this cream. It felt great on my constantly-washed hands. And smells wonderful.

Once I was in China, getting checked in and going through security. I only had 1/3 of this handcream left. But it was more than the allowed limit. So I took a good amount out. Put it on my arms, legs. And passed it down the line, behind me! Quite a few women said 'thanks!' and they tried it and passed it down.  Just a fun incident to remember-- which makes me smile!",1
This really isn't a lotion like the title says but I was surprised nonetheless.  Burns going on put keeps razor burn and bumps to a minimum throughout the day.  Youll smell like an 80s Lounge lizard but the relief is well worth it.  Its my new go-to from here on out.,1
Stays tacky even after 9-12 minutes under the light,0
"I never used facial soaps until I was introduced to the Ahava mud soap. I have used it now for 3 years and my skin has never felt so soft. This is a small grey bar that doesn't look pretty. But... wait until you try it. It lasts for months. Every time I have a visitor and they try it, thry ask where to buy it.i have been using all of the Ahava products and love th3m all.",1
"The color is more matte purple then pink like I thought. It's thicker nail polish which is good, but the brush is very skinny so applying it can be a challenge.  It doesn't chip as easy as other nail polish I've bought. I might buy it again, but it is pricey & I don't care for the brush.",0
"I really like the Coola sunscreens. I don't have sensitive skin, but I have very sensitive eyes and when sunscreens run into my eyes they'll be red and burny for hours. Coola sunscreens do not hurt my eyes ever. Also they are light weight and non greasy and make a great base for makeup. And I've never gotten sunburnt while wearing them.

That being said, 2 stars only for this version. I HATE the tint. I have pretty fair skin...on any makeup brand, I am the lightest color with pink undertones. I've used other tinted sunscreens and they were fine. This one is too orange. If I'm wearing it under makeup it seems fine and just gets blended in, but I don't wear makeup every day and putting this on make me look like I've rubbed bronzer all over my face.",0
Thought I was buying tommy bahama st barts set sail. This seems to be another product very weak and rubbing alcohol smelling.  .Appears to be made by another company licensed to sell under the TB name.,0
"I have mixed feelings about this curling iron, because it has some really great features and hasn't royally screwed anything up yet... it just doesn't work very well for my hair.

Here are some awesome things:
-the swivel cord... keeps it out of the way when it needs to be
-the temperature adjust... allows you to choose exactly how hot you want the iron
-it heats up VERY quickly
-it has a little stand so you can prop it up when you need to put it down on the counter

But for some reason, my curls just won't stay. I'm still giving this 4 stars, however, because I don't doubt that this is because of the length and thickness of my hair, and not necessarily the curling iron itself. I have not tried it on its hottest setting yet (because I'm scared of the burn horror stories I see in reviews) but may just have to try it if nothing else works.

So overall, it's a very cool looking curling iron with a lot of really fantastic features, but it hasn't quite lived up to my expectations yet.",1
Didn't do much except tingle.,0
Way smaller than you think,0
It was great the few times i used it... after that it dried out fast and I cannot use it any longer.,0
"Product arrived early and well packaged. Absolutely LOVE matte finish. I want natural nails and this products makes my nails look great. I much prefer this to shiny clear base coat. Four stars because I have only used product for two weeks. I don't know whether or not it will help strengthen nails and allow them to grow out without splitting which is my hope. In the mean time, it makes even my short nails look the best they have in months.",1
"Functions well and doesn't expose too much blade. However, I don't think a piece of metal is really worth $22 plus shipping.",1
"This shatter polish is a nice, hot pink color.  It looks great over white or light pink polish.  Unfortunately, it seems to disappear when used over darker colors.  But this product is still very usable and great to have in your nail polish collection.",1
"This makeup feels weird.  If I were rich I might buy it just to poke it with my finger.  It's kind of fun that way.  It reminds me of a cold gel shoe insert- it is VERY different.
It actually is a seaweed based product so it is mostly water with the pigment suspended in it.  This is the most natural looking makeup I've ever worn.
  The color is great.  I used Bisque # 5 on my fair skin.  Usually I would go for an ivory but the bisque is what was offered.  It works great - I suspect it will indeed work well over a variety of skin tones in the light to medium range because it is so very translucent.
  I am aging and have some fine lines when I first wake up, and this does not do a thing for them.  IN fact, it maybe makes them look a bit worse.  I think this product would be better on younger women.  It is non-comeodogenic, and hypoallergenic, fragrance free and - I like this one - CRUELTY FREE.
  It is made in Japan.

  The product comes in a container that looks a bit inexpensive at first glance, but when I consider it carefully, it is a container that is designed to keep the product very moist.  The container locks to a seal and has a pad at the top to help keep the moisture IN the container.

  STUPID ME did not know how to go about using it.  I did not read the ample instructions that came with it.  That's just my style.  So I sat there poking this weird feeling makeup, giggling, until I poked a hole right in the top of it.  I later found out that was a no-no, but other than making it look ugly sitting in the container, the makeup is still working fine.

  I've put this on with my fingers, a Bobbi Brown stippling brush, and a sponge.  Of all the methods I've used, I like putting this particular one on with my fingers best.  Besides the strange poking addiction I have with it, I actually found that using my fingers give me a very, very nice finish with this product.  There's never a line of demarcation - it just blends right in.  I don't need powder either.  It's just very natural, with great coverage that is really amazing considering how little pigment is actually going on your face.  It's very unusual makeup.  It covers REDNESS like a dream!

I developed some shine but only after about 4 hours.  This makeup lasts on me as long as the Vincent Longo blush does - about 14 hours in cold weather.  That's all I've got to test it in, it will be interesting to see how it will do in Georgia's hot, humid summers.

I'm only giving it 4 stars though because it doesn't do much to hide fine lines.  My face is fairly smooth but I do have those lines, and this product seems to settle in to them a bit and does nothing.  It might be better with primer but I did not test this with it, so I can't say.  I did use moisturizer under the product.  If your skin looks smooth and young, this foundation should even up your skin tone and make you look fabulous.  If discoloration and making your tone more even aren't your only concerns, you might want to try something else.",1
"I used different darknesses of the XenTan products when I tried them.  I pretty much knew by time I tried the second one though, that there was no way I was going to be able to stand somewhere for 4 hours.  Thats just not working.  It was probably for the best because the light tan that I ended up with was much more reasonable anyway.

This product went on really smoothly  using the mitt.  You really need the mitt to get it to go on correctly.

I had no orange issues.  That was amazing.",1
"I really like this! The texture is like butter, but not greasy. It only takes a little, so the sample size for $2 is a bargain! Have I seen any groundbreaking results??? No, but I don't expect to see such results after only a couple of tries. This product is not heavily scented and I didn't experience any stinging from use.",1
I would have returned this item if I was able to. The shadows were practically invisible. Forget this palate and buy Lorac's PRO palate. It's night and day better. I gave this one away.,0
It was delivered in time and the product is authentic.,1
Disappointed in the bottle. Will not spray. Not worth sending it back.,0
Color different than online color!,0
These make my skin worse not better.,0
"Great product, but way, way too dark for me. There is no way of knowing until you buy it and apply it. Maybe they offer lighter colors...hmmmm....anyhow, this looks super natural, I mean that is not orange at all. No streaks. But, for me, it's not natural to be that tan. I used it twice, and felt the glove was very much an integral part of proper application. Wash glove in sink after use. Don't wash glove with your clothes.",1
"I have very course & thick asian hair, normal scalp, and wash every 2-3 days.

Stila Hair Refresher does a great job keeping my hair and scalp smelling/feeling fresh and non-oily.  I have dark hair, but the powder blends in well and doesn't make my hair look chalky or weird.  I like how the product dispenses and wish the nodule where the powder comes out were longer to allow me better target and control.  My only complaint is that my scalp breaks out afterward whenever I use this dry shampoo; this does not happen when using my other dry shampoos. But it's possibly an allergic reaction due to an ingredient(s) in this product. The Jade Blossom scent smells better than the Creme Bouquet scent (which smells way too 'old lady' for me).  It would be nice if this product were available in a unscented option as I generally don't like smells in hair products.

**12/30/12 UPDATE: Still a really good dry shampoo. My scalp doesn't breakout nearly as much if the product is applied 1-2 inches away from my scalp and massaged through the roots with my fingers. Also, applying the product by shaking lightly (kinda like a salt shaker) without causing a layer to sit on top of the scalp prevents breakouts on my scalp. I still don't love the smell, but delivers as a great dry shampoo. It takes a little practice to dispense and apply the proper amount for your hair--but in the end it's worth it.  Especially if you don't like to use aerosol products like me.**",1
A little light in color. Great coverage,1
I expected to love this as much as the same brand & flavor bath oil that I had purchased in a sampler box. I was disappointed.,0
Doesn't work for thick hair that stands up.  Stays kind of sticky too.  Would not purchase again.,0
"Fake Product, buyer beware do not buy!

You can find better product on NYC street",0
Was excited to get these until package arrived with product leaking and looking used. Cleaned off the container and tried anyway for the hope of copper colored hair. Instead not much change to my hair except for a weird smell and a headache. Save your money. I am returning.,0
"I had been using the Klorane spray dry shampoo, but I changed to this because of its non-toxic ingredients.  I use it often, at least once a week.  This goes on pretty white, but I can brush it in fairly easily, but I have blonde hair.  Not sure it would work as well on a brunette.  Has a strong lemony scent, but it dissipates for the most part by the time I get to work.  I plan on buying again once I run out of this bottle.",1
"Saw this at my Derm office and picked this up.  Ever since i had laser done on my sunspots, i've been religious about applying SPF daily.  I am still trying to find one that is thin enough to be applied under makeup without buildup, patchiness,  tackiness, or balling up. First day, applied a toner, then a light water-based lotion, then the  Elta SPF. the feel was a tackiness that never goes away...after hours my hair would still stick to my face and the SHINE was incredible, the same shine as  if i slathered coconut oil on my face ( i know because i slather coconut oil every night to remove makeup). I thought perhaps i put too much product on my face. So started all over...washed my face, light swipe of toner then the Elta SP; Result was same tackiness and shine.  Thankfully my derm office will take this back. i",0

"The 3 x .25 oz. sampler works very well with NuFace's microcurrent devices. I know this because my wife has been using one for the past almost one year and she continues to be very pleased with it.

If you are going to use them 'as directed' you will be making quite a commitment because you are expected to apply the Nourisher and the Smoother twice daily and the Lifter once a day. I have to admit that Ms. Cthulhu is only using them before the microcurrent treatment and she's only doing it twice a week because she's in 'maintenance mode' at this time. And she's very happy with the results. Her skin is above-average sensitive but, so far, she is tolerating these quite well.

I am not a specialist and there are lots of ingredients in each of the three samples but the makers claim that the Nourisher contains apple, grape and alpine rose stem cell extracts, the Smoother has a long list of multi-syllable and difficult to pronounce ingredients and the Lifter features Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid.

To conclude, these are good skin treatments. They seem to enhance the effects of the microcurrent NuFace devices, don't know if they should be tried without it. Also, 'for best results', the makers recommend that you use them together. Like most skin potions, the don't work the same of different persons so, given the price, trying the sampler before making a more substantial commitment is probably the right thing to do.",1
"Smells nothing like the hair product. Sharp smelling, could see this as a true unisex sent. Strong sandalwood notes and citrus sent.",0
I haven't used much of it yet but I hate the container.  You never know what you have left.  It's a pump with a tiny hole in the middle that the cream comes out of,0
very good,1
This is one of the very best scents of all time but it requires alot of resprays as the scent dissapears in 30 minutes . However it is still so good i highly recomend it . Just respray as needed . This is a scent so good you will wish your entire house smelled like it all year around. This is Thanksgiving in a bottle.  Sweet cinnamon buns in the fall woods with the smell of baking thanksgiving treats wofting through the air.,1
Tried all products no improvement will stick to buying over the counter products as the price for this trio wasn't worth it! Berta Boone,0

"The curling iron is faulty.  It keeps turning itself off and I have to keep on turning it back on which makes it a very lengthy and not very satisfactory way to curl my hair.

Nice product but too expansive.,1
Love it!!! Skin feels wonderful.,1
I LOVE this product. Such an amazing product.,1
"nice for the face. Smells good and doesn't linger.  Kinda spendy, I think other SPF face tan lotions do just as well for less money.",1

Still saw very dark wrinkles under my eyes after weeks of use.,0
"I have very dry hands and wanted a lotion that was moisturizing and could fit in my bag. The size is good, but other than that I don't like it. It smells a bit like an old lady, the tube is plastic (thought it was metal based on the design) and feels cheap, but worst of all it is not ""ultra-moisturizing.""",0
"It does curl my hair, but it's not ceramic, I used low heat but it still fries my hair...",0
"I have purologies conditioner which I absolutely love, so I was expecting a similar type of feel.  This leave in condition falls up short.  I have hair that is about 4 inches below the shoulder.  I've tried this product several times.  It feels very sticky in my hands and when dried can leave my hair feeling stiff and I never put on more than 1 pump.  My hair is no easier to comb out than if I didn't use the product at all.

My advice to people is to buy their regular conditioners and don't waste your money on this product!  They need to go back to the drawing board on this one.",0
"This is junk - wish I could return.  I have used many Jan Marini products through the years and this is not typical Jan Marini quality, feels like your face is slimed after using.  Wish I could return, total waste of money.",0
"When I first started using this product, I thought I had found a miracle.  The bags under my eyes were noticeably smaller and the skin around my eyes seemed smoother and moisturized.  After about a week, I noticed swelling around my eyes, but chalked it up to a hayride, although I've never had that reaction in years past.  After continuing to use the product, my eyes continued to be more and more swollen.  I still didn't make the connection that this cream was causing the swelling, and, by this time, flaky, dry patches, because the initial results were so good.  Anyway, in the end, I had to take a round of prednisone and discontinue using the cream.  After a week, my eyes were finally back to normal.

I'm sure not everyone would have the extreme reaction that I had, but I thought I should give people a heads-up that this product has the potential to build-up in your eye tissue and cause a delayed allergic reaction.",0
"I only have two perfumes/body sprays total. Im not a huge spray person! But I got a sample of this from Sephora a while back and it spelled awesome. So I had to find it and the only place I could find it was on amazon, for some reason. It smells a little different than the sample I had, not sure why. But its still a pleasant smell.",1
"While this moisturizer has some good ingredients and an acceptable aroma, it feels sticky on the skin well after applying and doesn't really absorb as well as it should - which is saying something in my case because my dry skin tends to suck up all moisture that even comes close.  I also have sensitive skin, and it kinda burns just a little.  I really WANTED to like this product after looking at the list of organic ingredients, but I just don't.",0
"I have dark brown hair that is oily the day after it's washed. Although the tint of this product is more of a light brown color (lighter than cinnamon) it does blend pretty well with a boar bristle brush. I could go without washing for up to 3 days with this product since my hair looks noticeably clean after I use. There is no sticky residue and it does not stain my scalp like other products I used. I have a sensitive scalp and this product does not irritate by any means. The big downside for me for this product is the amount of product. I used it about twice a week just on my roots and the can only last about 2 weeks and a half. For $18 a can, I would hope it would last the whole month. It ends up being more expensive extending my blow dried hair than washing my hair with shampoo that costs over $60 per jumbo container. I've tried many other dry shampoos and this one is on my top three, but it just lasts about 30% less than those (such as CHII, Bed Head, Tresemme, and other brands). Would recommend if you have the budget for it or don't plan to use it frequently.",1
"After reading several reviews I bought two of these for my wife for each home, hers and mine.  After occasional usage, twice in the past 5 months, one of two broke-down.

Hope it can be resolved quickly with amazon or will get credit card involved to use extended warranty service.",0
"This product doesn't do anything the box says it'll do aside from adding a little shine to my hair. It definitely doesn't tame fly aways. It seems to just add some extra tackiness to my hair that makes it snarly faster. Bummer. Won't buy this again. Oh and it smells like you're spraying straight perfume on your hair....like sweet, musky, strong, strong perfume. No bueno.",0
Really love this scent! A little goes a long way.,1
"It's a little heavy, other than that I really like it.",1
Would not buy twice.,0

"I'll have to update my review once I've used this product for longer, but so far I LOVE IT.  It's a bigger container than I expected, an a dab goes a long way. It will last me quite a while. I absolutely love the smell, and it feels great once on. Doesn't affect my make up at all.",1

"Love the quality, but find that it's unbalanced and a little heavy.  Not portable but not too big either.  I recommend this though it dries my long hair quick and leaves it healthier than a regular blow dryer!

"It's not that I dislike or hate it.  It didn't work as advertised.  For the first time ever, I'm disappointed with a Blinc product.  This did NOTHING for me and to spend several minutes and get zero curl is a major fail in my book.  I'll stick with my Tweezerman manual curler that takes 20 seconds and gets the job done.  It's not so much the wasted money, it's that Blinc let me down with this in a big way.  The new primer that came out makes up for this great- in- theory, bad- in- execution,  product.  Buy the primer, pass on this curler.  Take it back to the drawing board, Blinc.",0

Excellent product with anti aging benefits. The only product line I use for my anti aging regimine. Neocutis Bio Serum,1

"I liked the idea of this wand so bought it, however returned it because I found that the shaft is not great for hair on the medium to fine side,  I think the upgraded version of this wand with the coated wand is probably worth twice money they are asking.  If you have corse hair that can take a lot of heat then it is probably OK for you.  It works like they say it does.  The waves didn't last as long however, I found myself doing touch ups mid day.  I guess it just depends on your hair structure.",0
Highly recommend for the price. The bottle and scent seem real. Some fading from the Original I typically buy at the mall for over $75 but value for the price. Clean transaction.,1
Love this color. As another reviewer mentioned the polish is a bit thin and watery. I used a white coat prior to applying and then 3 coats to get the desired full color. It looks great. Just make sure to use a white base coat and multiple coats to acheive the full color.,1
Extremely disappointed with this lipstick. On initial application the colour is vibrant and gives a matte finish. Although after about an hour and a half it starts to settle into the fine lines and looses it's vibrant colour. Going over the first application once you start seeing it settle doesn't help! I found myself having to completely remove the first application and apply it again. I expected better quality from this product since LORAC is a highly raved brand.,0
Works great,1
Nice hair dryer but a little heavy for a mid sized dryer.,1
"I bought it to cover my wrist tattoo since it can't be visible while I am at clinical (for nursing school).  It didn't really stay on.  My tattoo was visible within the hour and since my uniform is white I couldn't risk it rubbing off on it.  I even used the setting powder, but no luck.  Maybe if it was in an area that was not as often touched or moved it would have worked better.",0
very good,1
"My wife tried this cream for a week and was disappointed. She says it was moisturizing and she didn't have to use much to smooth lines, but even when she used a lot it didn't help the shadows.  She was happy that it didn't have any fragrance and didn't make her eyes water or itch.  She doesnt plan to buy more though.",0
My favorite and the scent does not offend anyone.,1
"The product works fine for shaving. No problems there. Definitely felt/smelled the Menthol. Kind of an interesting ""cool"", yet burning effect on the face.

But it smells like a retirement home bathroom. One that hasn't been cleaned in awhile. I also didn't appreciate there was no English text on the product, so I can't read the ingredients. What's ""caked-on urine"" in Italian?

It makes you smell like a 90 year old man. Since using this, I've found myself hiking my pants up over my navel. Also eyebrows have sprouted, creating little ""horns"" that I can braid into my new gray ear hair.

Do not recommend. Unless you can remember what you were doing the day we invaded Normandy.",0
"Initially wasn't convinced it was doing anything, but after a couple of uses, this leaves your hair feeling a lot cleaner, and looking a lot healthier.",1
"I saw this from a beauty blogger and thought the results would be more dramatic. It's fine, but I do find the mascara is a bit dry. Works fine, but probably would not repurchase.",1
"Shockingly strong. I just flip my head over & blow dry it & it makes my hair get tangled, which is annoying. But if you blow it out properly with a brush, it's amazing.",1
This product does exactly what it says it does.  I was not disappointed at all.  Great Find!! Received my product on time in perfect condition. Have tried others but they don't hold up to my expectations.,1
This cream made my skin very irritated. It was burning pretty bad and I had to stop after 2 days.,0
Kind of works but you get like nothing for the price..... I would not buy again and do not recommend.,0
Maybe it's cause my eyebrows are already thick... but my lil scarce hairs aren't growing back....,0
The rubber piece on the eyelash curler quickly fell off and I was not able to use it.  The extra rubber piece they offer did not fit.,0
Purchased because my stylist uses this on me and the price was so much less than what my salon sells it for but I don't get the same results as my stylist,1
"Big fan of many of the R+Co products I have tried.  This cleaning foam feels like shaving cream and spreads evenly throughout your hair.  Overall it seems to clean your hair well and is highly moisturizing, imparts shine, and controls frizz.
It smells WONDERFUL and the smell sticks around.  I get compliments regularly when I use this product.  My only complaints about analog is that there isn't as much as one would hope in the can and that without daily usage it leaves my thin straight(ish) hair limp.  My hair looks fantastic the day I use it but I can look pretty greasy the following day.  I use this and will continue to do so but need to intermittently use a more clarifying shampoo.",1
"It does cover the grey, but it does make you scalp/skin brown, too.",1
"Loved it until I took time to research the ingredients. After discovering I have hashimoto's hypothyroid auto immune disease, which can be caused by toxins like chemicals in beauty product, I have decided to quit using this product due to it containing Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Polyquaternium 5. It's not as bad as many of the others -- so kudos for Paul Mitchell for trying -- but they're not quite there. For more info on unsafe ingredients, see: http://www.ewg.org/

So going to find a less risky product. **SIGH**",0

"This is the only curling Iron I've ever used.. the very first one I bought was 8 years ago and lasted me about 4 years.. before the inside hinge broke off.. I bought another and I suppose they had by then been updated with the 360* rotating cord so no it doesn't twist and tangle.. ever since they have easily broken within months..twice the little black thumb grip broke off.. then the rotating cord stopped working (like it somehow disconnects the actual cord from the rest of the wand so there's no power.. this was the last one I bought (bringing me to a total of 4 AFTER my first one) and from day #2 of using it the rotating cord once again was causing the power to go out.. it turns on for the most part.. but as soon as the bottom turns with the movement the light goes out.. and if I'm not watching it consistently to make sure the light is still on.. I end up losing the heat and having to wait.. I have more hair than Mofasa, curlier than a cabbage patch kid and with the very first one I got (without the rotating cord) it would take me about 10 minutes to do my hair, it was amazing.. ever since they changed the model, besides breaking as easily as I just stated, they don't heat the same either.. it takes me longer to get to the highest setting and it takes about 3-5 slides through my hair to set the curl properly instead of just 1 (with the old model).. I don't know if they changed the actual metal piece, but they must have for a cheaper version because like I said, it used to heat in about 40 seconds and flatten my hair with one slide.. not I'm lucky if I'm done with my hair in under 30 minutes..",0
"Love the color, even great for subtle blush, but wish it lasted longer...  and was organic",1
"Won't use anything else now. I went to a salon who had just changed all of their polish to vinlux. I fell in love with it there and actually bought my color and this top coat off of them. Since then I have bought every color possible. If done correctly this polish will last forever. It stays and looks like a gel polish. If I do use a different brand of polish I still ALWAYS use this top coat. It's thick and smooth. Only problem with all of their polishes is that when you get towards the bottom the polish kinda gets gooey. But I still buy it. That says something.
UPDATE
I still love this polish. It works very well. But as I said before.... it gets kinda gooey towards the bottom. I've bought several of these bottles now and I've noticed that I'm only able to use half to 3/4 of the bottle due to the consistency. I'm not storing it wrong or differently than any other polish I have or have had. I've tried several ways to soften it back up to be able to use it but I can't seem to find a possible solution. I've demoted it to 4 stars.",1
"I received a sample of this product in the mail and was excited to try it. I put it on after I showered at night and went to bed. The next morning I woke up with a rash of red bumps that itched on and off anywhere I applied StriVectin and also on areas immediately surrounding it too. It took about a week for the rash to go away.

My sample did not have directions to test the product on a small area before first use, so I suffered a week of my hips, thighs, and breasts being covered in an awful rash. I'm just glad I never put this stuff on my face!!

It may work for some, but definitely test it in a inconspicuous small area first. I do not normally have sensitive skin so I am not sure what is in this product that made me (and other reviewers I have seen) have such a bad reaction. Due to this I would strongly recommend that anyone with any degree of sensitive skin or allergies AVOID this product unless you wish to suffer some possible side effects.",0
His made me super greasy! He old formula was so much better for my oily skin and now I've been trying every other moisturizer under the sun and nothing works the way Daily Defense did. So upset about this!,0
Love it. It actually does help keep makeup in place!,1
good product,1
"The Noodle and Boo baby wash exploded everywhere in the bag it was in! I am furious! For an 18 dollar bottle of baby wash you would think someone would protect the contents a little better. Half the bottle is gone! They thought it was cute to wrap the pump in tape, which now won't come off, and didn't think of screwing the whole cap on! Not impressed at all.",0
"Until today, I'd have given this product five stars.  It's a great dryer, and I agree with the other reviews that say it's powerful and cuts drying time down significantly.  The only minor complaint I had was that it's HEAVY.  But I assume that indicates better quality.  Unfortunately, today, like many others have reported, the dryer started to smell like it was burning and made a pretty terrible screeching noise.  Iv'e only had it for four months.  I let it cool down and tried again.  Still the terrible noise.  I'm still giving the product four stars, though, because I called the manufacturer, and they are going to send me a replacement.  So I'll give it another shot and cross my fingers that this was just a fluke.",1
"Bottles came unscrewed and leaked inside the box.
It looks like someone opened them and added product and one bottle was fuller than the other.

It is tricky advertising to describe a product as shellac (thinking I am getting the type that requires UV light) but what is shipped to me is Vinalux.  And it cannot be returned.  Grrrrrr.,0
I don't like this product at all. It was very visible as an applied powder when I applied it to my friend and hard to contain. Not a fan.,0
I love this product but it didn't arrive in good condition. There was product in the lid so was extremely difficult to open plus wasn't a full bottle. Normally this would be five stars.,0
"I'm not one to care too much about ""fragrant"" products, especially ones that rinse right off. This is the exception of all exceptions. The smell is positively the most amazing, intoxicating scent I've ever smelled for a men's body product. Oh, and they didn't even have to put the irritant, ""fragrance"" in as an ingredient. Therefore, I now my head to you, Jack Black for creating such a tremendous scent without synthetic fragrant products. Also, it is sulfate free! You wouldn't know it by using it, as it lathers perfectly. One full pump is enough for your upper body.

I never bought into the notion of a product being able to ""wake you up"" in the morning. Again, this is the absolute exception. Not only does the scent smell amazing and permeate throughout the shower, it truly does wake your senses up. I attribute that to the use of Menthol, Rosemary Essential Oil and Lavender Essential Oil -- two of the all around great multi-purpose oils.

If you are on the fence to shell out the amount of money required for such a premium body wash, don't think twice. It's that good. Oh, and it's sulfate free, fragrance free and paraben free! So, even the most sensitive skins can use it -- believe me, I have extremely sensitive skin. While those harsh preservatives are left out and it seems to be an ""all natural"" cleanser, there is one major drawback.

It also has hydrating features that are highlighted with the presences of both Shea Butter and Sunflower Seed Oil! So what's the catch?
Unfortunately, I am a realist and have to be a critic of JB even though I love most of their products. That catch/drawback is the presence of Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate. Sounds relatively harmless right? Wrong. For starters, it comes BEFORE Shea Butter & Sunflower Oil, but that's not too big of a deal. The big deal is that it is a FORMALDEHYDE RELEASER!

It slowly releases formaldehyde into the product to kill any microbes to keep the product fresh and have the 6 month shelf life as advertised. Now, the actual formaldehyde is more than likely very, very trace amounts. But, since it's such a cult favorite, over a period of time, who knows? Formaldehyde is one of the few known carcinogens. Why take the chance when you already have Phenoxyethanol as a preservative?

Dear Jack Black, I highly doubt the formaldehyde releaser contributes to the greatness (smell and general usage) of the product, so why risk it? Please replace it with a more sensitive and/or natural preservative. Heck, you already have Phenoxyethanol in the product. Why not just use slightly more of that? There is tons of evidence to show that is a very mild preservative. Just a thought.

Overall, though, I cannot resist the temptation of the premium price and Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate. I love, love, love it and will continue to use it with a hopefully substitute for the Sodium Hydroxy. Another gem from the Jack Black Turbo line. Highly recommended.",1
"This is a 8.4 oz jar. It has green tea and honey bits in it. A little goes a long way. The scent is fresh and clean. I only use a  little bit ,because the scent stays well. The cream is in a non -greasy  consistency and it absorbs in the skin well. Pleased with purchase! :)",1

"Awesome product, until like several other reviewers experienced, my hairdryer began cutting off in the middle of use. This appears to be a known defect, and the fact that it hasn't been fixed in the entire life of this product line is unacceptable.  I've never had this issue with many ""cheaper"" brands. Buying it would be a gamble, and in my case, a huge waste of money.",0
"It was too fat, and I didn't care for it.  I thought I would like the 2"" curl, but I went back to using my 1.5"" or my flat iron to get a large curl.",0

I bought 2 of them so it lasted but since it is only 0.5 oz...didn't last 2 days...I didn't see any changes o improvements on my hair or my split ends, so I cant say this works...I really don't think this product is worth that much...I put 20 dollars on my hair one day and it looks exactly the same. what a rip off!",0
"I don't have to spend so much time blow-drying anymore, blow-drying makes my hair fall out more anyway. This gives you the same blow-dried look in less time.

I love it.",1
The description of the product says it is a 3.4 oz and what I got is a 1.7 oz bottle. I feel cheated.,0

"I love the colors of Butter London polishes and have six that I bought on a BOGO sale to try them out.  The colors I tried were Come to Bed Red, Rosie Lee, Dahling, The Black Knight, The Old Bill, and Yummy Mummy.

I paint my nails several times a week and use many different brands, from drugstore to even higher priced than Butter London.

As much as I love the colors and hate to admit that I wasted my money on these polishes even with the BOGO deal, but I did waste my money.  The wear of these polishes is AWFUL.  Probably one of the worst wear times in the industry in my opinion (and yes I always use a good top and base coat).  To give you an idea of the numerous other brand I've compared this to: Orly, Nails Inc., Chanel, OPI, Essie, China Glaze, Deborah Lippman, Wet n Wild, Revlon, L'Oreal, Sally Hansen, Sinful Colors, Spoiled, among others.  I think that this is probably the worst wear of the brands that I've tried, the other brands have hit or miss poor wear time for a shade, but all 6 of the Butter London polishes I tried wear horribly.  The colors that I tried also have different finishes (cream, glitter, and shimmer) and they all chipped within about a day.

I further suckered myself into spending money on the brand by thinking that maybe the same brand of top/base coats would make a difference (and this is the case with some other brands).  So I got the base coat (Nail Foundation Flawless Base Coat) and top coat (Hardwear P.D. Top Coat) and it made no difference.

I'd love to love these polishes, but the value for the price is not there!  There are loads of other ""3 free"" polish brands that have great colors and are cheaper, so if you're interested in these polishes from the ""3 free"" aspect do some shopping around.  If you're in love with a specific color, there are not a lot duplicates in other brands, so it may be worth it to you.",0
I guess there is really no substitution for real hair on your head!,0
"I have thick long hair and this is the only curling iron that holds my curls without applying any styling products. It does leave a burnt smell on my hair, but I prefer that to the smell of hairsprays.",1
"To encourage the seller doing better in the future.
Would like to express my great impressive of this product.
And I would highly recommend this product to who needs it.",1
"After using product for 2 months , I see no difference.",0
"I really wanted to love this product
But after trying it I am very disappointed
2 stars only because I do like the applicator
But the stain itself doesnt hold long and it leaves lots of patches.. it will stay on the very middle of my lips but not my full lips
I tried and tried so many times because I wanted to love it but it just didn't work
I do like the color but I wish it will actually stay on my lips",0
"Very expensive, but recommended by my dermatologist... so I'm giving it a try for a while.

NOTE:  in regards to yellow color of the creme portion.  It is true with this product that the white cream portion was a little more yellow in color than the one I had originally purchased directly from my dermatologist.  However, I called up SkinMedica and verified this bottle has a good expiration date (expires in june of 2015).....  so that's really good.  The lady on the phone verified it was a genuine product.  Also she said the color can vary a little just depending on the formulation, or possibly how the product was stored.

I plan to keep buying these on Amazon.  Saves a ton of money vs buying at full price.",1
"The product has separated.  The expiration date was 2020, so I have to believe the product was not stored correctly or was exposed to weather conditions that ruined it.  Cicalfate was recommended by a skin care specialist, so I believe it is a good product.  In the future, I would try to find it in a store.  Shake the tube and if you hear liquid sloshing, do not buy it!
Cicalfate was recommended by a skin care specialist, so I believe it to be a good product.",0
"Why put up a picture of the wrong color?  I have almost the exact color that came, so thanks for that.  The name is right but the color is wrong - so now I have a useless item.",0
"Still trying different ""styling products"" but haven't got consistent and lasting curls yet.",0
I love this color! Unfortunately is chips pretty quickly requiring me to constantly fix new pedis and manis. However I love the glitter so much I don't care! If you want to do something different or add a little spice then this is the color to do so!,1
"I purchased a similar razor from the Art of Shaving a few years back and really loved it. It broke while I was traveling, so I purchased this one as a replacement. I noticed that it's a bit lighter which wasn't too big of a deal. It does make a difference in how you hold the razor though. My biggest issue is that the gap where the hair is supposed to slide in/catch is a quite a bit narrower than my previous razor. Because of that it takes much longer to get a clean shave.",0
"Not really a fan.
For ref: my beard is about 6"" long at the chin and naturally a bit curly.
This just doesn't do anything for me. Have to apply to wet beard, it's painful to put on dry because it gets kinda sticky and makes the beard tangle bad. It doesn't really have much hold, doesn't really straighten, doesn't have much of a smell, doesn't tame wild hairs at all. It's pretty pointless.",0
"I have dry eyes and appreciated that this mascara does not irritate them.  It was easy to apply and I liked the shape of the brush as I could easily reach the outer and inner lashes.  It also didn't smudge.  I needed a couple coats of it and still wasn't quite getting the fullness I wanted so I applied another waterproof mascara over it that was less expensive.

For $25,, it would be optimal to apply one coat and get full coverage which is why I deducted a star.  I am able to use relatively inexpensive hypoallergenic waterproof mascaras with no problems and would not purchase this due to the cost as well as not getting the volume I wanted.",1
falls off of window.,0
Love the product but instead of 1 nice 6.7 oz bottle ....I received 7 of the 1 oz bottles....really? Geesh,0
"Thank you, great product fast service will purchase again.",1
Works,1
"Don't do it. It may seem wonderful and nice but if you have any problem they don't help you.  The woman on the phone told me ""obviously there's nothing i can do to help you.""  Really? WOW?!!?!? I then asked can she send me a sample of a different product that I might like better and she flat out said ""No. Since you don't want to invest any more money in the company then there's nothing  I can do for you.""
VERY EXPENSIVE LESSON!  Try another brand!",0
Sorry this product did not help my nail problem. Others find it helpful.,0
"I ordered the ""Limited Edition Bonus Gift Set""  which was supposed to included an extra sensitve brush head and refreshing gel cleanser 6oz which were NOT included.  Of course Amazon gets 5 stars for its flawless return process but Clarisonic gets an F for not packaging the product correctly.",0
"It's very heavy, leaves the skin oily looking, and doesn't blend into skin tones. I bought the medium and it was far too light (like I was wearing 90's foundation 2 skin tones too light).  My knee jerk response was to buy the dark and that was obscenely dark (like I was in black-face too dark).  Wanting this product to work, I blended the two together to the perfect shade for me, and I still don't like it.",0
"I have a short pixie that I love to faux hawk and I have that likes to do its own thing.
With the powder play I can shake it on and spike it up... Half way in the day I can change my mind and push it down. It's so moldible and amazing.",1
"Prior to the Mia FIT I was using the Mia 2.

To be honest, they are both basically the same thing.  They have very similar features - both have two speeds, both charge with a magnet style cord, both have a timer on the cleansing.  The main feature change is the style of the device, which now fits in your palm like an egg vs a paddle style design.  It's really an ergonomics thing and I do seem to prefer cleansing with the FIT - I feel like I get a better gauge of things and it's more comfortable.

If you have the Mia 2 and aren't looking to splurge there really honestly isn't anything that I honestly feel is worth upgrading over to the new device.  However if you don't have either one and are looking to get a new one, I highly recommend the FIT.  If possible, the best idea is to go to someplace like Ulta and see which feels best in your hand before giving it a go and then going from there.

I do really enjoy the cleanser that comes with the MIA and already purchased a full sized version.",1
I love Blinc products.,1
Wonderful product!,1
"(From my wife:) This stuff is worthless. I might be willing to stand in the shower doing nothing for 3 minutes IF it worked, but it doesn't do anything--I didn't see any difference in the color of my skin. Don't waste your money.",0
Smells great but didn't last the full day. Not even close. Went to a department store to compare products and the department store's product was much stronger.,0
MOST beautiful color! I love this nail polish. Goes on smoothly and makes keeping my manicure looking great very easy. Worth the cost. Best nail color.,1
"I wish I could say the same as all the other ladies but I guess I'm part of the small percentage. I'm 39 weeks with my first pregnancy and I have used this cream twice daily for the entire time and although I have gained 50 pounds, is not all on my belly. I got stretch marks around belly button and downwards. I wish this wasn't the outcome. Although they are hardly noticeable, they are there and that's the whole point.",0
"I bought this dual voltage curling iron to use while visiting Israel. It worked perfectly, and I like it so much that I am using it at home as my go-to hair tool.",1
This polish streaks. I have it away,0
"I like it, is very good.",1
"Works great, gets the job done",1
This is absolutely great for my fine hair...gives body that lasts.,1
"I loved this curling iron. Used it once and it worked perfect. Went to use it the next day and it wouldn't heat up. Now I have to wait a month for them to replace it. Not happy, because I have multiple events this month I wanted to use it for.",0
I bought this brush years ago and I wanted to replace it as it was getting old. I never write reviews but I had to on this product. It's much smaller than the real one I have and the quality is much different. Don't waste your money. This is going back.,0
"I have been looking for a facial sunscreen that isn't too greasy, too thick and makes me look like a ghost and make me break out. I found it with this product. I will be reordering this product as soon as I need more.",1
I only put it on top of the eyelid and yet it smudges down and make it look like I have dark circle.  I am very disappointed with the product.,0
learned about this brand at my pedicure salon and loved it. smell is light but perfect and the thickness you don't have to use as much either..,1
"This conditioner has become my favorite.  Just a little goes a long way but my highlighted hair, which can easily become dry and straw-like, has quickly become soft and shiny.  The smell is light and reminds me a conditioner when I was a little girl - super light and won't compete with your perfume.  It may seem a little pricey but I will bet the bottle will last a while.",1
"Does not work so well...I like the little pocket sized curler from this brand but it cracked after about 6 months. It worked great while it lasted so I ordered another one, that one didn't crack but just didn't curl after a bit. So I thought I'd give this one a go and maybe have better luck, nope! This one I just can't seem to get to do much of anything. I went for a cheap metal one instead and have had much better luck. I wish this one worked as good as the first little pocket sized one from this brand because that one worked amazingly while it lasted!",0
Tried this to just soften the curls not necessarily get rid of them. I had my friend apply it who is a hairdresser. My hair looks exactly the same after.,0
Wife likes it.  It's shampoo. How excited can one get?,1
not for me,0
"After using it one time it stopped working at the start of my second use.  Thank goodness I still had my old faith Vidal Sassoon Ionizer hair dryer to finish drying my hair.  Unfortunately the bonnet replacement has been discontinued therefore I'm forced to buy a new product.  I returned the Hot Tools Professional for a refund. to put it kindly, it was a waste of my time and money!",0
"It didn't work for, just leaves my skin with a burn sensation. Wish I could return it!",0
"I spoke to my aesthetician and I'm told that only certified retailers are allowed to sell Osmosis.  I found this out after I purchased this, so it would be good to know if this is legit.",0
I understand that everyone's skin is different but there are way too many reviews about folks getting breakouts on their face after using this product. I would not recommend this product. It was used just once and is sitting in the box - unfortunately its too late to return it to Amazon :(,0
"it pills, waste of money.",0
"Color is very pink , lighter pink than the picture. A high quality blush but I wasn't expecting it to be so pink. I thought it would be more rose but it's almost bubble gum pink.",1
I ordered the 7% and received the 5%....it would have cost more than it was worth to return but I am very disappointed ... difference in price and performance.,0
Very low quality of its battery life. And it seems like hurt my face sometimes.,0
"My all time favorite hand lotion!  It's deeply moisturizing, but without the greasy feeling. Moisture lasts a long time, so I don't have to re-apply too often.",1
"I dislike most hair products, but pomade is an exception. Its waxy texture helps keep hair manageable without making it stiff. It leaves it with a nice shine without looking artificial.

After a recent haircut that left me a little disappointed, I opened the glass jar of Baxter of California Soft Water Pomade, dipped my fingertip into the contents then applied it to my hair. Suddenly, my waves could be easily manipulated into place, and the disappointing haircut was a disappointment no longer.

This is good stuff. I recommend it.",1
My former hair dresser used this for added hair shine. I bought a tube and used it until it was all gone. So happy to find it on Amazon.com. Adds luster to hair without making it greasy. Feels so good I almost want to use it on my face!,1
"It works very good.  I meant to order the leave on conditioner, but goofed.  Both products makes my hair, when I had hair, undergoing medication treatments that have made me lose my hair, feel silky smooth and adds moisture to my scalp.

Fair price.  Doesn't take much of the product even on long and thick hair.  I received a bottle of it free from beauty brands and have been using it ever since.",1
Great shaving product... You don't need a lot of this cream to have a great shave.,1
"Did not like this, takes way to long to dry.  Dazzle Dry Top Coat is a much superior product - dries rock hard in 5 minutes always.  Tried on 1 finger and disappointed I am unable to return the product.",0
"Great stuff. Reccomended by a stylist 3 years ago and have used it ever since, along with Morrocan Oil Curl Control Cream. I've got solid white, funky, old guy hair and the combination of these two after I shower makes my hair look much more in control, softer, and thicker. No in shower conditioner needed.",1
It was delivered in time and the product is authentic.,1
love it,1
"Good product.  Hair salon use to use it, but doesn't now so am glad I found it on amazon.  Great.  Smooth and shiny as advertised.",1
Not sure these small samples are effective or produce noticeable results.,0
My favorite!! I will purchase again when I run out!!,1
I was really excited to try something that would lengthen my lashes but it really didn't do much for my tiny Asian lashes. It is not very thickening so my lashes looks very unnoticeable. I would not purchase this again.,0
"I did not find this hairspray to be a strong hold, wasn't impressed.  Have bought Rusk in a atominizer spray and found it held alot stronger, I do not think they make the atominizer bottle anymore.  thought I would try this, but not impressed",0
Helped with cradle cap.,1
This is the best product I ever used.  If keeps my skin so much more clear than anything I ever used before.,1
Doesn't seem to get quite hot enough and is time consuming.,1
Very strong only need very little!,1
"Best product I have ever use. Leaves my curls soft and shiny, no frizz.",1
"This hairdryer was good while it lasted. Unfortunately, it stopped working this morning. It just slowly stopped blowing and then completely quit. I only used it about 3 times a week for 7 months.",0
"This is a great, effective sunscreen.  It is hard to find a good sunscreen that contains titanium dioxide.  It also comes in a tinted version which doesn't turn your face white at all.",1
does the job/ I like ti.,1
I know everyone's computer screen is different but this is a RED color. Now i love red but I like blue/red burgandy side. On my screen it looks like a dark pink/raspberry color. Gave it to my daughter.,0
Very good item. As it was described. I use cnd shellac nail polish at home and i have proffesional result,1
One of the plate doesn't work after 1 week's usage. I bought 4pcs with my friend. I don't think this is okay at this price. Super disappointed!,0
Love this lipglosss! wish it wasn't being discontinued Jane Iradale :-),1

"Lasts longer than other top coats I have tried, but doesn't last a week on me.",1
"This is a very well weighted razor, it is my first DE and I am very pleased with it! I've used it multiple times and have yet to nick myself, it sits well in my hand, and works great",1
"I have this exact brush, and do NOT believe all the celebrity hype this is getting.  I bought this because of a celebrity testimonial stating that she tried so many brushes and this made all the difference, and how it's a quality brush that'll last forever...yeah right.
It has made no difference in my hair.  It is no better than any other brush.  I also bought the brush they recommend to clean it, and it seems to destroy it.  It bends the bristles, so it's extremely difficult to clean, even though I followed their directions to the letter and was very, very gentle.
It's simply not worth it.  I believe in paying more for quality and if this was better than an average brush, I wouldn't mind paying so much for it.  But it's not.",0
Wish you couldn't see through to the fibers at times.  Wish there was an identical hair touch up.,1
"You have to sharpen it every single time.  I have used it 4 times, its already half length.",0
"Always have great results with this product. Literally dries out any pimples trying to come out, overnight.",1
This item arrived broken inside thebox,0
"I wanted big wavy curls...I knew this big iron wouldnt make tight curls, but I have long hair and it didn't even wave my hair...it took me like 5 min on one section to get a semi wave that fell flat minutes later. :(",0
Its okay. I prefer a setting spray over a powder.,0
"For years I've used this product through all of its evolutions and different names.  I swear by it even though
the quantity in the containers has decreased while the cost has gone up.  But with my new order I'm peeved.
After removing the clear sealing wrapper, I discovered my new Oxygenetix was NOT the Opal I'd
ordered, but a different shade, one I can't wear..  $66 is too much money for this mistake.",0
I love AHAVA body lotions and went looking for more of there products.  This had amazing reviews but did absolutely nothing for my face.  I did not like the feeling of it on my skin. I didn't see any difference after using for a few weeks and it made me break out constantly.  I should have read the ingredients and did more research before I purchased such an expensive item.  I recently purchased 'First aid beauty' lotion and saw a difference in my skin after 1 use!!  I returned the AHAVA serum and got a full refund.  Great customer service.,0
"My husband bought me a Chi Rocket dryer in August 2007 for $135, which to me was a fortune for a dryer. It was absolutely wonderful for a little over two years, when it just up and quit on me. When I called Farouk about getting it fixed, I was told they would only fix them for two years after the purchase, and I was about 90 days over that. I can't see ever spending that much for a dryer again, I definitely didn't get $135 use out of it. I guess it's back to Walmart dryers again. The one my husband's using is about four years old and cost $40!",0
"I have thick coarse hair, this product did not work on my hair.",0
My wife liked it,1
I don't like the product. Don't do much/,0
"I wanted to like this product however, the colors were too muddy. Plus as the day goes on my lids get oily so that is not a look I want from the start.",0
"I've had cystic chin acne for 10+ years. I've been on antibiotics and every topical cream that is available. This cleanser is the ONLY product that has worked for me. Every time I've gone cheap and tried a less costly product, my acne inevitably comes back. You might experience some peeling, but keep using the product and it will go away.

Also, chin acne is linked to hormones and when I eat a diet high in dairy, my chin will break out. Cut out dairy completely for a month and your acne will clear up!!",1
no effect,0
Orange,0
"It just wasn't the product for me.  Yet, I am super picky.  Nothing wrong with the description or product yet simply a case of personal preference.",0
i love this face wash. I have acne prone dry sensitive skin..this works amazing.i have not broken out much since using it almost a year now,1
"This doesn't work at all for me and honestly just gets all over the place.  If you need any real exfoliating, just use a toothbrush.",0
"this is wonderful product and very competitive price. we bought small bottle one from local department store, but it's very expensive. this time we bought big bottle and can last longer time. we will definitely shop again. thanks.",1
just did not care for it,0
I did not like the scent at all. Strongly prefer their signature lotion which has a soft and fresh scent.,0
"I love pureolgy, but this smells horrible and dryed my hair out so bad. I would stick with the smoothing pureology instead.",0
the wife uses the shower gel every time she showers,1
"I had been a loyal Batiste dry shampoo-er for a long time before I read a review that said this dry shampoo was the BEST EVER and well worth the cost. Was it a promotional trick? I don't know. This dry shampoo smells great but that's about all it has going for it. No, it doesn't leave white residue, but that's because it doesn't do anything at all. In fact, it leaves my hair oilier. Please, please, stick with Batiste, or if you haven't tried it yet, give it a try!",0
"This cologne is counterfeit. It is made of synthetic ingredients and gives me a headache. Natural Eau de parfumer does not do this. For 10$ less than full retail price, I would expect it to be genuine. Don't buy from these people",0
I'm fairly light complected- sometimes makes my face look 'muddy'.  I expect it to be way better once I get some color this summer!  Seriously really nice application though- easy to use.,1
I used this product twice a day as instructed. After 2 weeks so absolutely no change. I have gone back to using AVON  Ulimate which works so much better SuzyL,0
"This product arrived broken and lost part of the liquid. The number 1 had the seal broken. new so it should be sealed very well.
I want this product but I do not know if I would buy this product now do to the fact that it came with the seal open and that doubt will now be there always.",0
I got the right product but wrong color it should be bb7,0
Was cracked when arrived at my home gave as a gift I felt horrible,0
"but returned it as it was an error on my part as the barrel was too large so I went back on line to order the 1.5"" by the same maker. It's a nice iron and comes with extra springs which I am happy about. My hair is only med length so the 1.5"" better suits me for waves.",1
Terrible waste of money.,0
I really like this shampoo. It leaves my hair shiny and glossy after I blow dry it. I also put some on my bath sponge and I feel fresh and squeeky clean after I rinse. and towel dry. So yes it is two in one. Nice light scent.,1
Been using this product for years.  You can order direct from manufacturer but I use prime account and cost is a wash.,1
"Terrible product. Not a gloss wax at all. More like s gloopy, drippy, Vaseline.",0
"I love Clarisonic. It's pricey but not compared to regular aesthetician visits. I felt the brushes were too gentle to be called ""deep"" poor cleansing. The brushes all felt like they were the same. With that being said, I use this tool on a regular basis and would recommend it if you can shell out the dough.",1
Really great for humidity and is so light on the hair. Recommend 10/10,1
I really like the Dermablend brand. This is my fourth product that I have ordered and I have been pleased with each one. The concealer covers skin blemishes and smooths uneven skin tones. It is also good for under the eye circles.,1
Best for keeping nails strong.,1
"I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.

Overall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",1
"I love this nail polish so much, it does what it says it is going to do. And the best part is that it is safe, not like other nail polishes on the market.",1
Broke 60 days after purchased and they would not replace!!!!!!,0
"I like it a lot, I don't use it as much because it is a little bit too shiny to wear at day light.",1
This makes everyday a perfect hair day! The scent is amazing and it has worked wonders on my hair! It not only has made my hair look better it has made my hair healthier!,1
"The Clarifying and Anti-Oxidant ones are good; the rest are junk. Such a cool box set but a lot of packaging waste. The look is compensating for a sub-par product.
Clarifying -- Super saturated, kind of a peppery smell, soft skin, well penetrated
Anti-oxidant -- Oversaturated with liquid and bubbly like a face wash. This didn't leave too much behind. Does have a slight stickiness to it.
Age Defy -- Super saturated, light old popcorn smell, soft skin, a bit softer
Exfoliating -- If dust was a cologne, this would be it. Very soapy, started stinging my skin quickly. Overly saturated, I don't think anything happened here as far as exfoliation. Skin is slightly moisturized. Not great.
Brightening -- Very soft fabric, slightly sweet clean scent, nice. Sticky Not much else.
Hydrating -- I like the weird scent of this, its sweet but strange, ironically dried my skin.",0
"Fast delivery, scent doesn't last long",0
Wouldnt buy this again. Made my eyes water pretty badly.,0
"I really wanted to love this stuff with all the hype and the decent price for the amount, however it made me break out into a ton of little bumps and now I have overall uneven skin texture.  I  did small experiments with going a few days without it - my skin got better.  As soon as I reintroduced it for a day I had new bumps again.",0
Love it,1
"This product does not do what it says.  I wasn't expecting miracles, but I was expecting the product to be what it says.  Very disappointed.  Would not recommend anyone to purchase products from this company.",0
Ive been DE shaving for years. This product is poor quality for a high price. After using this cream I got my first razor burn in years! It lathers nice but does nothing to protect your skin. I really was hoping for something special after paying 25$. The only reason not one star is it smells nice. I will stick to my shave soaps.,0
"Well, I didn't do the due dilligence I should've.  Found out, after the fact, that this contains: spearmint, wintergreen, and eucalyptus oils.  Imagine my surprise the first time I used this.

I imagine this is probably what caused the burning sensation for so many reviewers.  It's incredibly strong and made my eyes water.  I tried it a few times, to see if maybe it was just the initial shock and I might acclimate after a few washes, but no.  It still stung far too much for me to tolerate leaving it on the suggested amount of time.

My skin certainly felt clean afterwards, and there's no red coloration left afterwards... but that mix of oils was just far too much for my personal taste.  Maybe if they scaled back a bit, I might consider trying it again.",0
"This just isn't the right color for me. I thought it would be darker. It stays on good and has a pretty shine, but just too light.",0
The end of the applicator has a piece that controls the amount of lip gloss released. This piece broke off and then lip gloss leaks everywhere and can no longer be applied. This has happened with 2 different lip gloss applicators and at $ 28.00 it's to costly of a lose so I will never order this product again.,0
Well Worth the Money!,1
I like the gloss but not the color I thought it would be clear and not a tan color on the lips,0
"Brunette; oily hair day after wash (sometimes, day of!). This doesn't really take care of the oiliness and makes my hair feel heavy and sticky. I used up a whole bottle to give it a chance, but no changes. Wouldn't recommend.",0
"I read and reread the pamphlet, watched the provided disc and today have a dark brown discolored area on my left cheek. I started slowing etc but the machine was to fast and abrasive from the get go.  So disappointed....",0
"It works well as a makeup setting spray, but it made the skin on my body feel dry and sticky and break out. Acne on the body is beautiful because it is rare, but I did not expect this product to give me acne all over my body.",0
I absolutely love this cleanser!  I know some people have mentioned the smell is terrible but I love the way it smells!  My hair is super soft and has so much body now.  I used to struggle with limp fine hair and now my hair is full of volume and feels lighter!  This stuff is absolutely amazing!!!,1
Great price versus paying full retail.,1
"Unlike others have said, it does NOT wash out easily. It smells of black licorice which is an awful smell to me. Loaded with a bunch of crap that's unnecessary in a hair product. I wonder how many of the rave reviews actually paid for their write up...

I'm returning it because it doesn't fit my needs.

Anyhow, it does have a decent hold.",0
Not useful at all. Both my pre-teen child and I tried but none of us found it helpful. It is too sticky also. If this is not fake one then this product doesn't fit us at all.,0
Leaves my hair crispy. Would not repurchase,0
Flat iron is fake! I was so disappointed. Not only was it fake but it was badly bent up. I will not be ordering from Amazon again.,0
"I have short spiked hair and use this product to give me good separation with a slight moist look. The product works great but if you wear glasses or shades on your head, the product WILL transfer to the lens. If I am going out at night and do not expect to wear shades, then I use this. It holds well and lasts all night. For daytime use, when I may wear shades, I use Bumble and Bumble Grooming Cream as it doesn't leave a residue.",1
"It pains me so much to rate a BLISS SPA product so poorly.  But this product was AWFUL.  I sprayed it on after my makeup.  First I noticed that it made my mascara run and then it locked in the mess.  I had to use baby wipes to get this cleaned up.  Next, rush to the car to get to work.  I looked in the rearview mirror and much to my horror my face was absolutely shiny.  OH NO.  Like mirror gloss shiny.  NOT A GOOD LOOK.  And it stayed like that all day.  Sigh.  I give this product a pass.  Not sure what happened, usually you can totally rely on this company for a kick-a$$ product.  Not this time.  :-(",0
"No es Original, y llego con fecha vencida.",0
"Heats fast.  Extra long cord makes it easy to use, you don't feel tethered to the electrical outlet.  Makes styling easy and quick.",1
"This is a decent non-greasy creme, with a mild but persistant fragrance.  It is reminiscent of baby powder.  But what surprised me was that when I first tested it on the back of a hand, the aroma ended up surviving a shower.",1
"My skin has cleared up a bit but I still have a bit of acne. It's less harsh than a lot of other face washes. It's nicer on the skin, smells nice, and doesn't dry out my face. I'm probably going to buy again.",1
The only part of this product that is not as good at the plug in one that I previously bought is that the brush seems to be a little softer than my old one.,1
lengthens and separates lashes better than any mascara I've used!,1
"I have a bad habit of rubbing my eyes when I'm tired, so a friend got this for me as a gift. I quite like it as a midday pick-me-up-- the vibrations loosen the tension in my temples and over my sinuses, and the gentle eye-tapping does help me feel more alert. I know most people use this as a tool to help apply their eye cream, but I prefer it as a de-stressing massager. I keep it at my desk at work.",1
"Maybe I'm not the market for this product. I feel like you have to be some very particular evolution from Axe man to Silicon Valley millionaire to want to use a product like this (or to even care to spend more than a couple of bucks on hair stuff).  I'd call this more of a clay than a paste, and the consistency made it difficult to make it not show in my thick, dark hair.  I actually enjoyed the scent, but at the same time it felt very...artificial.  I have no idea what ""sweet tobacco"" smells like (but I really envy the guys that get to make this nonsense up for a living), but the closest approximation is probably sandalwood.  I'll be sticking to the $2/jar Garnier paste I buy at CVS, anything else is probably more thought than I care to expend on my hair...",0
"I have been buying this from my dermatologist for some time so when I saw this being sold on Amazo by ShopXperts for
$20 less I thought I was getting a good buy. When I received it I noticed it smelled and looked different and felt different on my skin as well. The color was off and there was no tingling when I put it on my face. I looked very closely at the container it came in and it looked the same until I looked at the bottom. The real product says Taral Plastics on the bottom and it also says 2oz 58mm. The copy from this company does not say any of this and has a funny horseshoe like thing on it. Just to be sure that it wasn't because Image Skincare changed the container they used and the formula of the cream I went to my dermatologist today and bought a new container of it. It still says Taral Plastics and 2oz 58mm and the cream is still the same as it always was. DO NOT BUY from this company. You are getting fake Junk!!! Makes me so angry that they are getting away with this!!!!!  I called Image skin care directly to see if they sell to this company and they do not! They said they don't sell to any online retailers and Shopxperts is not an authorized retailer. Learned my lesson- you get what you pay for.",0
Best remover!  Doesnt leave my face feeling oily but nice and clean,1
"The brush itself is nice and Im very happy that its Animal Cruelty free, that is one of the major reasons why I bought this one. However, they should not advertise that it comes with a stand because the ""stand"" is really just the plastic box it came in with a small hook to hang the brush off of but it doesn't really hold very well. I expected to get a nice stand considering the brush was so expensive.",1
I bought this product off of the picture and when I received the bottle it has a white pump instead of the brown. I called Neuma and they said this was not their shampoo. When I notified the company they wanted me to pay shipping to return the shampoo. Bad Business!!!!!,0
"I own the double sided smaller version of this strop. The material is great for getting a very sharp edge on your razor (russian) But, this strop has a 1""x1/2"" blemish in the upper third of the strop. actually it is more like a scuff mark, as it is rougher than the rest of the strop. This is in the working area, I may return this item due to this defect, or mishandling, or previous return, or whatever
**edit** its curious that this was the last one in stock. It also just dropped in price by 7 bucks. For sure it is going back now. Too many things are fishy here to me, and loss of another star.",0
"I like the unique natural handle, it is a series of concentric circles piled on top of each other.  This provides a comfortable and effective grip.  The weight is also just right.  Soft, but not as soft as my favorite facial brush.  It is also less dense. Still, it feels great on your face.",1
Great on my daughter's SUPER curly hair!  Cut the time in half that it takes for her to straighten it.,1
"Another brand was recommended but I chose this one based on size and price.  I am pleased with it, though I have to have someone else apply it due to ails of my own.  It does the job in my thinning areas and have gotten compliments on how my hair is ""growing"" back now.",1
I have been shaving my face and head for years. I have used every razor and cream out there trying to find the one. I use other Jack Black products and love them. But this cream sucks. When shaving my head I gouge my hair twice. I have never cut my head like this with any cream. When you put the cream on it dries to fast and becomes tacky and you cut yourself. I will stick to foaming creams they work fine for me. I can put it on my face and head at the same time and shave my face and head all the way through without worrying about it drying out and getting tacky. Jack black you must do better,0
"A very wearable, natural pink that gives a beautiful flush without looking artificial. Love it!",1
I love this lotion! It smells great and feels silky smooth. I use it all the time.,1
"This eye cream is very very thick, it doesn't absorb well at all. It cause my eye area small white dots. I really wish I didn't buy this .",0
"It sprays well and evenly. It doesn't gunk up and my hair is not left too stiff. It holds relatively well.
But, the scent is strong and persistent, especially right after you sprays it. It goes away after some time but you still get a whiff of it once in awhile through out the day. Then, when you are just about to forget about it, you get another strong whiff while you are trying to wash your hair in the shower. And it's strong enough for me to cringe a bit.
It could be that my tolerance for fragrance has gone down considerable since I've started using products with less or no fragrance and stop using cologne since having babies in the house for past few years... but I have used other hairspray with some fragrance in them and it didn't cause me to such adverse reaction to it.",0
"Oily and shiny, looks bad.  Does not cause redness though, so that is good.",0
Lovely curls for long hair!,1
Barely write reviews but I'm very disappointed and angry and mad at this product. I should've know better but I've learned my mistake. It broke the hell out of me. This product don't even deserve one star,0
"I've bought this product many times but this time it looks and feels different.
It used to be translucent, this time I noticed the product is much whiter.
It never used to irritate my skin, which is why I've always come back to buy more
But this latest purchase makes my skin itchy and sore.
I suspect I might have purchased a fake Avene this time.",0
Too dry for me,0
Been wearing it for a month without touching it up!,1
Best razors I've had,1
Not as good as the medium one I had.,0
Not crazy about the spray dry wax. I don't feel like it really helps my style at all.,0
"Perfect foundation, will buy again!",1
"The taste is too pungent, the thick creamy essence",0
Bad smell. This product is a mediocre cleanser.,0
I like it.  It comes out very silky.,1
"It doesn't slide easily through the hair. It even hurts and cut my hair. On the other hand, it doesn't heat as it should be.",0
"This thing burned my face. my skin sensitive. Maybe for a person has a skin more "" strong "" will be good.",0
"Originally, I loved this iron. However, after a couple of months, it stopped working properly. The light flashes and doesn't heat continually, so it was definitely faulty. I contacted the seller and they said they could do nothing about it. So, it was a waste of money.",0
I can not work this thing,0
I dropped this once soon after getting it and the entire end broke off. Leaves creases in my hair too. I'd get one without a clip!,0
I've only been using this product for a few days but I can say my skin looks and feels better.  Skin feels smooth and so clean.  Would have given 5 stars but the loose packaging allowed the two bottles to move around and broke the lid on one of them.  Luckily no product leaked but the lid is destroyed meaning I have to transfer it to another bottle.  Disappointed in that but love the product.,1
This stick was a little dry.  I have used the little container and like it's consistency better but would like the stick better if it was more moist.,1
"I thought this product would be a nice burgandy color for winter, but it was WAY too dark. I have longer nails and it looked almost goth on me. It might look better on someone with shorter nails. A few of my friends saw it and commented on how dark, almost black it looked after 2 coats. So far I haven't been able to give this bottle of polish away!",0
We purchased this flat iron a year ago. I thought it would last longer but we are having issues with it now. The light never stops flashing to indicate it is completed heated up. Doesnt seem as hot as it used to be. For the price hoped it would last longer.,0
"I was excited to get the box, but it was a waste of money. The box is very random with Men's items. I regret the purchase, but at least I'll use it for stocking stuffers.",0
It's good  Nice foam thick and good. And you bet it will last for a long long time I'm glad to got proraso,1
This is the 3rd bottle of bought!  It's really strengthened my hair and made it much more shiny and smooth.  1 bottle lasts me about 6 months.,1
Great for very dry skin. In winter I have on my face very dry skin. This cream really helps a lot and it feels like a natural product.,1
"Delivery on time. The pomade is quite good, a bit greasy and hard to take off.",1
Very good,1
I love this OPI brand Infinite Shine. I bought the primer and top coat from Walmart and had been hunting for the right color. I chose the wrong one. This looks like Pepto Bismol on your fingers. It is thick and not natural looking at all. The Beige Is the Reason is a MUCH more natural look.,0
Way too watery,0
"has almost no color, wears off easily. not worth the $2 I spent on the sample.",0
"Fake, I've been buying this for three years, this gave me rashes. Very fake",0
"The reason I don't give this a five-star rating is because I can't get the product to dry very easily. I've used it as a base coat and a topcoat and either work ok, as well as a base coat and top coat together. (Don't do that--it will never dry.) I believe it's a good product, but I actually wait to apply it on top of a manicure the next day so it will dry.",1
"It appears to work. Tip: open the tube immediately. I left mine in the bag in sun while I used up another brand's lip sunscreen. Weeks later when I was ready for this one, the product was completely stuck inside the cap-unusable. Somehow it settled back down where it belongs but I'm not sure how long that will last.",1
Paid of 2 oz.  Got 1.7 oz .  Really disappointed.  Have used this product for a couple years but won't be buying it anymore.,0
dont like it makes my hair feel oiley,0
This did not do much for my pimples. It did not make the pimples smaller or anything. Quite disappointed.,0
"Giant  chunk of hair burned off just now.  Temperature is not properly regulated.  This was on a medium setting.  Like right in the middle.  I've been curling my hair for ages. Also, after this, I thought it was a user error so I tried to curl another section and my hair immediately sizzled upon contact with the barrel.  Waste of money.  I for real want a refund and will never buy this janky brand again.",0
"Made my hair messy thats all, waste of money",0
It lasted for 6 months and it just doesn't get hot anymore,0
"I've used natural/organic cosmetics for 20 years and have tried many brands both large and boutique.  Baxter of California Clay Pomade is the highest quality, most effective hold, easy to use, virtually scentless, natural ingredient matte finish hair wax I've ever used and I've tried several, including chemical brands.  I was using Alterna's Hemp Concrete, but it discontinued, so I tried this.  I wish I had found B.O.C's Clay Pomade first.  It's much better!  A little goes a long way, it holds wonderfully with no shine or crunchiness, it's easy to apply, it has virtually no scent beyond a very subtle herbal smell that you can't smell on you and of course safe and natural ingredients.

Some people had a difficult time understanding this type of hair wax and gave it 1-star because they thought it was dried up.  This is comparable to American Crew Fiber, only better, stickier and dryer.  This is NOT pomade at all and the name may be misleading.  It's similar to Play-Doh and you have to rub it firmly and rapidly into your palms to get a residue on them and then apply it to your hair by rubbing it in like towel drying your hair.  It give a messy to natural look, not a sleek pomade look.",1
Dried out my hair and took away its shine. This really is a terrible shampoo. I was thinking my hair was so damaged I needed to cut off inches! Until I switched back to my drugstore shampoo!,0
"For the price you are MUCH better off buying Crest 3D White or other drugstore whitening products. This didn't work for me at all. It did leave my teeth feeling very slippery and clean, but didn't do much for the whiteness. If anything my teeth dulled after a month because it was a month without using my Crest 3D white toothpaste!",0
Good product but not as soothing as one would expect for the price. I usually slap this on after the neutrogena shave balm for the smell.,1
"Maybe it's the style of a clay based pomade, but even after applying alot it didn't hold too well for me. The smell was pretty neutral. I only gave it 2 stars instead of one because the container is nice",0
"I ordered this from an infomercial, they said 14.95 for 30days, I was charged an additional 17.84 for shipping even though I didn't know if I was keeping or not, after using it I saw no difference, I called to get return policy, was told they would return shipping cost and cancel order. That is not what happened, I was charged the first payment of 79.95 a weekand a half after I returned, it is a Saturday and you can not reach anyone.  Not only was the product no good but there service was terrible, I now have to wait till Monday to talk to someone.  Buying from amazon is so much better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Shipper was great.
Product is too strong. I broke into a rash and was rushed to emergency room.

I would not recommend this product to anyone.",0
When you put on it is not defining.....,0
I have a hairline!!! :) My advised is learn how to properly apply it. This way you don't look silly like I did on my first use.,1
"I just don't find this to be good at all, not blendable; I actually like my Walmart makeup better. And now that guy on the front just gets on my nerves. Too expensive and not good.",0
"This is my first butter polish and I'm just not that impressed. I LOVE the effect of this polish (the blue iridescence is so cool!) but the polish starts chipping around the sides of my nails after a couple of days. I'd expect longer wear, and the same thing happens with or without a top coat. It's just not worth the price!",0
Love it,1
Does the job beautifully and smells nicely. I've tried a 9$ purple shampoo and the difference between the two is noticeable. The milk_shake shampoo cleanses my hair well and doesn't leave it all tangled. I'd definitely recommend it and I'll buy it again.,1
AWESOME FACIAL WASH FOR ACNE,1
"The wick is immense. When trimmed to 1/16th-1/8th of an inch, I get a 2-inch flame that smokes. The flame at that size is so hot that it melts a large reservoir that quickly burns off (goes up in smoke). If the wick were of the proper size, I'd love this brand. If they can't get this right, though, I hesitate to buy this brand even though I really enjoy the scent.",0
Arrived leaky and too coagulated to use. Such a waste of money.,0
"Received it in October 2015, expires December 2015.  Not nice for a 50 dollar product.",0
"I like Jimmy Choo, do not get me wrong, if fact this is one of my favorite!!! I did not like this particular purchase! Even though, it says Eau De Parfume, presumably it should last long, right? Guess what??? It does not!!! The scent disssapearing within 2 hours. This is whatever you call it, but not Eau De Parfume!!!",0
greatest smelling lipstick ever. Its super moussy with the texture and the color is beautiful.,1
A complete disappointment. It almost burned and I threw it out.,0
Have not used being that the bottle was leaking to point of it's less than 1/4 left !,0
"Small 6 oz. bottle with more than 1"" of product missing below cap line...but no matter, it made my scalp itch.",0
"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this product, because I wasn't really clear on what it is.

It's much darker than I thought it would be, for a start (the color is named ""Latte""). It's not a self-tanner, but more like the bronzing gels that were popular in the 1970s (product is a cream, though). It goes on bit streaky and muddy if your skin is dry, and has a slightly glittery sheen. It washes off easily, so I wouldn't count on it at the beach or in the rain. Or to ""tan"" your hands. Also, it will get all over your clothes, sheets and towels. It's not waterproof.

While it's recommended for the whole body, it's probably best used to give your face, neck and cleavage--and maybe your shoulders--a ""sun-kissed"" glow for a night out.",1
"Supergoop is the best, this is the only sunscreen I use. It goes on SO SMOOTH and leaves no white residue like other mineral sunscreens.",1
"I was hesitant to purchase this product online before knowing what shade I needed so I decided to purchase it from a local retailer first. The only retailer in my area that was listed as carrying the product was Nordstroms but after searching for the product I found that Nordstroms only carries it in select stores and the one in my area wasn't one of them. After going to Sephora and Ulta stores for it with no luck I found out that it is primarily carried in medi-spa's because it is designed to be used on skin post-procedures. To save anyone else the trouble of searching for it I will let you know that the shades run a little light. I have fair skin and would have purchased the light medium , but I actually needed the medium. The product does have a nice sheer color and does make your skin look slightly firmer but I think the area that it is lacking in is the moisturizing. When you put it on it has a rather dry, powdery feel and is probably fine for someone with somewhat oily skin.",1
"This product works really well on breakouts, however, I question how safe it is for one's skin. Case in point: I accidently spilled a little on my dresser and when I went to clean it up the dresser's finish was lifted off and it left a pink stain on the original wood (since the finish was completely removed during the spill).  If this product is that potent to eat the finish off a dresser, is it safe for one to use on their face?",1
"This gel is too watery. It's not thick and will not hold thick, Asian hair types.",0
"Powerful and priced right, I purchased this hair dryer to replace an aging Conair 1800 watt dryer.  I was impressed with the numerous positive reviews for this product, so I thought I'd give it a try.

My first impression, as was the case for many reviewers, is how much heavier this dryer is than others I've used.  Its 9' power cord is substantial and the Professional Super Turbo 2800 (as it is named on the box...) is hefty , but not oversized.  The grip is comfortable, so the added weight doesn't seem that noticeable to me.

The selling points to this dryer are the following:

+ 2000 watts
+ 'Ionic' - negative ions eliminate static, and reduce drying time.
+ 'Ceramic' - emits the negative ions and generates far-infrared heat, which is less harmful to your hair.
+ (6) heat/speed setting combinations; cool to hot, all work well.
+ Extended life AC motor with limited 3-Year Warranty from time of purchase (with receipt) or time it was manufactured without a receipt, per the included instruction/styling guide.
+ Cold shot button.
+ Removable, easy to clean rear filter; twist and remove.
+ Concentrator nozzle - removable.

Unlike many of the reviewers, I noted no 5-10 minute improvement in terms of shortened drying time of my thick, wavy, medium length hair.  I also noted no great change in the texture of my hair after using this product.

I use the following styling products which tend to keep my hair soft, smooth and frizz free other than in the harshest humid conditions:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suave-Professionals-4-Piece-Keratin-Gift-Set/dp/B00ESYBV6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suave Professionals 4 Piece Keratin Gift Set</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suave-Professionals-Moroccan-Infusion-Moroccan-Argan-Styling-Oil-3-Ounce/dp/B00A0IWSIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Moroccan Argan Styling Oil, 3 Ounce</a>.

WORLDWIDE DUAL VOLTAGE 110v-220v</a>.

I paid about forty for it, which is on par with lesser dryers at my local store with shorter warranties.  The increased air pressure is salon-like, and the build quality seems on par with its warranty.  It's a very good product if you can get it at the right price, but it isn't a miracle worker.  If your hair is damaged and/or you need a haircut to get rid of split ends, this hair dryer won't fix 'fuzzy' results.  As long as you know this prior to buying it, you should be happy with your purchase.",1
Ok,0
"This shampoo helped clear the cradle cap right up after just a couple washes. I'll echo the review I read saying it does have a perfumey smell to it. I bought it knowing that, but I do prefer fragrance free products and wish there was an unscented version.

I'm not sure exactly sure how the shampoo clears up the cradle cap, but I've noticed since using it that there are tiny little scabby areas here and there on the baby's head. I can't be sure that the shampoo is causing it, but I'm also not sure that it isn't. I try to use this every other bath and a different shampoo in between in case this is somehow burning her and causing the scabs.",1
"Best Buy ever! Had it for years and I still use it. When it's new the temperatures were better to control, nowadays I have to set the dial to 4 and pass it though my hair about 2-3 times but it still comes out very nice",1
"I'm very pleased with the CND shellac. It wears well, usually 8-12 days. Happy bright green color- this photo is an accurate depiction. I'm sold.",1
"I found these last year.  Although they are a little spendy, they really work great.  Much better than the lotion which does come off on clothes, this doesn't go on clothing as much and everyone thinks I've been in the sun.  What a fabulous tan, they say.  Thanks.",1
Terrible! Not the real product!!!!!! Dont buys,0
"work great, but almost finished it in one day. My brushes feel softer, but you dong get a lot of product for the price.",1
This product is perfect for a tattoo full coverage. It's thick and has the high pigmentation needed. The only difficulty is to find the right colour to match my skin tone. Would recommend the usage of the tattoo primer concealer first.,1
"Love love love!! Smells great and feels wonderful! Although, I wish the sprayer was a little wider/mistier.
I got it as a lightning deal though, it's a little expensive for full price.",1
Bought it in May 2017 and just stopped working by January 2018,0
Very thin pads. Hard to separate. So so.,0
Goood,1
I am using still:)),1
the product didn't fit my NuBrillance there was no suction. I returned the tip and use a normal one without abrasion.,0
"We both use this, despite its ""for men"" label.  It has had a dramatic effect on my skin's clarity and has helped fine lines.  I have used this for several years now, love it.",1
"First off, I really like the Ahava product line - and this eye cream does actually work in terms of firming, etc.  The only downside is that it is quite thick and is hard to apply.  It also irritated my eyes and my eyes ended up red and teary during the day.  Just a heads up on that.",0
Bottle will last you forever!,1
"My friend recommended this brand and I took a chance ordering the ""mini"" ... I love it ! No regrets.... This straightener is AMAZING! Portable and lightweight ... I have super thin, shoulder length curly hair and it works fantastic. My hair looks healthier compared to what it looks like when I use my old straightener.... very happy I bought this product! It basically just turns on and off, no dial to change the temp...",1
"Have to use it a for few nights for those ""naughtier"" blemishes to disappear, but it doesn't dry out the skin, or leave it damaged like some acne products. You have to use it when it's settled, and then place a q-tip in the solute, which was somewhat difficult for me, because I keep my products in a drawer and so its not always easy to keep the bottle standing straight up",1
This is a great daily lotion!  It makes my skin softer & reduces the brown spots & fine lines on my face.  I will continue to buy Glytone!,1
This is a very moisturizing eye cream and I feel it helps to make the skin around my eyes appear firmer and brighter.  I have reordered it and that is something I don't do unless I am very satisfied with a skin care product.,1
"I was on my last drops of my 6 years old bottle so I decided to get new one. I think the one from amazon is definitely smell lighter  and doesn't last long. The one I bought from Macy's sometimes I could smell it after long day at work and I didn't spay much; one 3.4oz bottle lasted more than 6 years. The new one doesn't last  more than 3 hours. I spayed on my arm to see how long would it last and it vanished after 3 hours.
Update 10/22/14: after wearing it for two weeks i think the cologne seems to be real. it does last longer than my previous estimate, the smell is good, raised to 4 stars.",1

"I realize these are men's products but I am a woman. I have waist length very fine hair that is completely flat. A stylist told me to use men's hair pomades near the crown. It works very well at giving my hair some loft. I also have an annoying cowlick that this product can defeat.

I've tried this brand's pomade and that works great. I was looking for a slightly firmer hold. This clay product works better for me than anything I have tried. A finger full, warmed up in my hands and raked through my crown, gives my hair lift all day. I don't characterize the scent as tobacco but rather ( to my nose) a very grounded vetiver, ylang ylang type fragrance. I like it a lot and find it very distinctive and warm. If you need control, I've not tried anything better than this clay treatment.",1
It didn't work for me but I have super dark circles so I wasn't really expecting it too. Haven't found one yet that can conceal my dark circles.,0
My 95 year old mother has been wearing this makeup for fifty years and is happy with the ease of having it shipped to her.,1
Color is beautiful and even. I left it on for the full 3 hours (beginning with very fair skin) and I had nice color for a week. Only downside is that it definitely smells like self tanner.,1
"It did smooth out the face, but it all came back within 20 minutes.",0
"No more frizzies when blow drying your hair.  This brush produces a smooth style with the added bonus of shine.  I like it so much, I have ordered it in the Large version as well.",1
Good price. Skin feels very soft after cleansing.,1
It was okay but really didn't give my face much color  at all. I have blonde hair and light skin and it didn't really make much difference to my face. No I would not buy it again,0
"Great topical analgesic, doesn't smell too badly either. Long lasting pain relief from simple muscle aches. I use after the gym on a semi-regular basis. Goes on white but rubbed in it disappears without a greasy feel. Unlike Ben-Gay or many of the plethora of topicals on the market, it washes out of my nightshirts after a single washing. Really good stuff!",1
"This stuff is a watery mess.  I cannot believe that I was too lazy to send it back.  If you are interested in good self tanner, Vite Libra, also sold on Amazon.",0
"First, I meant to order the 1"" curling iron so I'm going to give you the approximate circumference of the 3/4"" one which is 2 7/8"".  When I hold the measuring tape up next to the barrel it measures 3/4"".  My hairdresser cut my layers a tad too short last time so my mistake worked in my favor. I'd be burning myself quite often if I was using the 1"" size.

I have a 1"" Hot Tool curing iron, just like this one, that I've been using for over 6 years. My husband replaced the plug once because I had to keep wiggling the cord & plug to get everything in the proper place for the curling iron to stay on. Recently I began having problems with the cord again, but this time it's where the cord attaches to the handle & that is why I was ordering another curling iron. This new design is supposed to prevent that problem...only time will tell. I will update my review if necessary.

These irons come with two extra springs...I didn't have to use the extra springs with my old one, but I'm very happy the extras are included. (We've had to replace the springs in other curling irons I've owned through the years. It was never easy to find a replacement spring). The temperature settings/numbers eventually wore off of my old one & I'm expecting this one to do the same because they're applied in the same manner. I have a favorite setting.  I marked my old one with a silver permanent marker so I'd know which setting to use. Although these curling irons get very, very hot I do not & will not use the higher settings. For goodness sakes, my hair isn't made from asbestos. FYI: My hairdresser recently burned a section of my hair off when her curling iron was set too hot. Thankfully, it was in a hidden spot, I don't have long layers, and I was able to cover the burned off hair until it grew back. Anyway, let that be a warning to you...it can happen. I've used curling irons for years & years & years & that was a first for me & my hairdresser.  I use the #7 temperature. It's the first setting on the 'Extra Hot' category. My baby fine hair is extremely hard to curl. If this curling iron lives up to its predecessor, I can expect many more useful years out of it.  And, soon, I will be placing an order for the 1"" size.

Great curling iron!",1
Very good product,1
"This works well and getting the make up off, without drying out the skin.  I definitely like the way it feels when I use it.",1
Your skin looks and feels better but does nothing for dark spots or wrinkles.,1
"Works as stated and requires very little to cover the face, maybe a pea size amount.  Will  purchase again.",1
It didn't do anything and I followed the directions.,0
"I have processed normal/fine textured hair that is on the dry side. Due to blow drying and using a curling or flat iron, my hair needed help. This is an ok product. Nothing great. My hair seemed a bit poofed when I used this product.",0
"Great scent. It goes on very well and initially smells amazing. Unfortunately, it does not last long at all. Maybe 10-20 minutes at most. I am highly disappointed. Would suggest buying elsewhere because this item may be a fake.",0
Don't waste your money. It didn't do a thing. You can buy the Rembrandt whitening kit for about 1/2 the cost & actually have whiter teeth in a couple hours.,0
"The product is fantastic but the shipping from this particular seller took over a week.
I've been using Toppik for over 3 years now and it's my life saver. I'm a female in her 30s with thinning hair at the top of the head. The key to this product looking natural is not simply shake it on top of your hair but to lift a strand at a time and add a small amount of Toppik at the root line, then lift the next strand and so on. I finish it off with a light coat of hair spray and it lasts until my next wash (3-4 days)",1
"I purchased the NuFace device through QVC.  It came with a small tube of this product.  I did a lot of reading about whether this primer was really necessary, or if other, cheaper, alternatives work  better.  I decided to continue with the NuFace Gel Primer since I feel it works perfectly with the device and I really don't find the cost exorbitant.",1
It stopped working after few months only,0
"I was so excited!  My favorite brand discontinued ""my"" color.  This was beautiful!  Went on smoothly, a crisp deep plum color. My eyes looked great!  Fast forward an hour - itchy watery eyes.  I was at work and looked like hell. I washed my face, cold compresses on my red rimmed eyelids, and took an antihistamine.  I never knew a person could be allergic to eyeliner.  Sensitive skin?  Be wary of this one.",0
Rivals my favorite CND Vinylux. I don't use the OPI top coat. I do use the vinylux top coat and a CND sticky base with this polish and it lasts well over 7 days. I'm a nurse and I'm always using my hands and still no chips and super shiny.,1
I just can't believe this product has gone up 33%.  That will prevent me from using it and moving on.  Other then that I would buy it over and over!  But not now!,0
"Made me break out, greasy and my makeup fell off after 2 hours.  Foundation primer is something I've been trying to skimp money on for years and have been failing hard...  ELF, Revlon, NYX and now this brand.  The best so far has been Hourglass Veil, pricey but worth every penny.",0
"A decent cologne..just met my expectations.. Mild, not overpowering yet good. A must try.  Was worth the bucks it cost",1
"Toppik melts and drips if you perspire, and turns blue. The 2 times I used it, a blue line dripped down onto my face. It is very hard to remove with soap from one's skin. And unless you constantly look in the mirror, how do you know if your face has turned blue?  For this reason, the product is just awful.",0
"I wanted to love this but I just don't. I love OPI but this makes your freshly painted nails peel off. It does dry super fast which is great but it's not always an even application & within 24 hrs my color peels off. This doesn't seem to happen with my toenails but it always happens with my finger nails. I've tried different polishes, no polish, waiting longer before applying this & nothing has changed the outcome.",0
"Maybe the reason is that I wash my hair everyday, maybe because I run my fingers through it a lot... Not sure. All I know is this feels absolutely horrible in my hair.  Wish I could get my money back.",0
"I bought this product because a friend of mine swore by it, and it had decent reviews. For me, it just didn't work out. I found that using one full size towel was pushing it, barley enough. I cut the towel in half and tried to do my lower body with one half and then my upper body with the other. The color developed by the next day (did this before bed) but it was pretty streaky and very orange in color. Not for me. It looks awesome on my friend but I guess my skin type just doesn't work with this formula. I gave it 2 stars because it is a convenient idea, and I have seen it look great on other people. Also, there is no color guard..so you cant see where you are putting it. For me, that is a must!",0
It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be but it helped me apply my self-tanner evenly.,1
"5 stars for the scent and versatility, 2 stars overall for value and performance. Maybe I just have the worst skin on the planet, but I used this for about a week hoping it would improve my dry skin problem and it did not. It made it more dry and itchy than before I started using it. I also purchased the cool moisture body lotion and that did not help either after applying right after a shower. Not the miracle worker I had hoped it would be.",0
Good polish,1
"A little tough to get the top off the Toppik jar off but, once done the applicator works well.",1
"I have dehydrated skin, and I found this product to be too rich for me. I started breaking out a little after using it for the first two weeks so I immediately stopped. It felt heavy while I was putting it on, and still heavy after I washed it off. My pores felt a little clogged, despite the product leaving my skin soft.

It might be better suited for people with dry (not dehydrated) or mature skin. For people with dehydrated, combination skin (or even normal/dry skin), I would recommend using a Shu Uemura cleansing oil.",0
Go for the Professional 12,0
It was highly-rated by a consumer report publication......it's clearly a quality product and I'm very happy with it.,1
"Bought this product for my kid. It has been used about one year. But no significant improvement. Just waste mony, I guess.",0
"I also received a bottle with 08/19 expiration date, and as other reviewers have noted, the oil and cream have separated, and it has a very thin oily texture. My last bottle from my dermatologists office did not do this!",0
I am new to self tanning but I got interested because I do not want to lay in the tanning bed anymore. I done research about he best self tanners for weeks prior to buying this. All research and YouTube videos suggested this brand as the best. I really like that it is a tinted mousse because you can see where you put it. The tan is not orange and I got so many compliments. The tans lasts for about 3 days. The one fault I have found is as the tan wears off it gets spotty and makes me look dirty. I am sure this is probably will all tanners but it is aggravating as well as it does not wash off easily.,1
Amazing!,1
Does what it is suppose to do,1
"I thought it was me. I finally read some of the reviews, and others had the same complaint! The spray nozzle or the mechanism stops working. This last bottle started sputtering after a few days of use!  The first time I blamed it on my son, thinking he damaged it by dropping it or something; but now this is the third bottle I have encountered with the SAME PROBLEM!  I didn't bother to read the reviews before because I had bought the product at a salon and also a beauty supply, but now I know that it is not worth the money.
That being said, I do love the product--just not the faulty spray bottles.",0
This oil did a so so job on helping my course hair be more soft...this oil did NOT have a great smell that really stays with your hair...I will not buy this again. I could buy coconut oil for 1/5th the cost and get the same effect.,0
"I The Art of Shaving products. I most love the Unscented line because the others are highly scented, which is fine for most but
My skin is sensitive to fragrance song love this set",1
This product is amazing for thining hair. If you just put a dot and massage to the scalp it actually works.,1
Love it,1
"I had bought this scent in reed diffusers, and absolutely loved it. So when I saw a room spray - visions of vanilla & bourbon danced in my head. Sadly to say the scent lasts for a whole whopping minute :(
What a huge waste of money.",0
"Very cute and interesting product, definitely worked for my skin to minimize blemishes",1
"The ceramic file itself is good and strong, I like it. But the plastic handle is so cheaply made I'm scared it'll snap everytime I use it.
---------------------
Update: I've had this for a few weeks now and used it twice, and the red ""hinge"" thing in the middle keeps falling out! I like the ceramic part, but the rest of it is very cheaply made, and I'm suprised Zwilling put their name of such junk. They used to be linked to such good quality, such a shame. Worth about $2, I'd guess.",0
Unfortunately there was nothing special about this product - defibitley not worth the money. I didn't have unrealistic expectations but I did thibk of see results after 30 days.,0
"I am posting this to hopefully help anyone reading tons of reviews on flat irons. I saw so many glowing reviews on the Babyliss pro nano titanium and was super excited to try it on my coarse, thick, color treated and relaxed hair. I had used the HAI  (black and blue one) for 10 years and wanted to try a new one out. This straightened really well, but after a few weeks I noticed the ends of my hair (especially in the front) was so dry, frazzled and damaged looking :( Then you need to flat iron it to make it look better, which damages it worse. I am now shelling out another $100 for a new flat iron and getting the ends of my hair trimmed. I would not recommend this, not worth the damage to the ends, that doesnt look good.",0
"After reading the reviews i looked forward to trying this lip butter.  I have to say I was surprised at how little you got for twelve dollars.
The quality was nothing special. I will get something else next time.",0
Bought this product to help with splitting and brittle nails.  But now my nails are worse than before.  Very disappointed.,0
This product did not really do much expect it did give me break outs.. I would never buy this cream again. Not worth it,0
"I have short thin hair it worked well. However, I need more small and medium size roller and the company hasn't acknowledged my email to address my preference. It seems they only provide additional large rollers.",1
"I really cant understand the price for this, but my wife loves it so whatever. She's only had it for 9 months so I can't really speak for the longevity of it.",1
"I love this dryer! Fabulous for all hair types. As a stylist who uses this thing every day, I highly recommend this dryer. Also, all the attachments have really come in handy.

My only complaint: it's a little on the loud side. Not intolerable, but it is sometimes tough to hear what my clients are saying while it's running.",1
"Roberto Cavalli &eacute; erfeito, adorei o perfume! &Oacute;tima fixao. Chegou no prazo prometido. Loja de confiana. Comprarei mais vezes. Ab",1
"Definitely nothing dramatic. I think more so than not this product works psychologically. If putting it on makes you feel better after or the next day, making you think you look darker so you walk with more confidence, then by all means, this may be the product for you. It's not like Bondi Sands or anything that really gives you color. I used this with my summer tan so I couldn't tell a difference. May try again when I'm super white. I think a drop got on my foot accidentally and the next day I saw a spot so I guess it does do something to some degree. -shrugs-",0
recommended by the hair stylist,1
The first one I received didn't fit my Clarisonic...neither did the second one. Ended up purchasing at a brick and mortar store.,0
"Had seen so much marketing around Art Of Shaving, that I thought I'd try it. I had used it once couple of years back, when my brother had it and i really liked it then. That was the older version. I have been using Taylor Bond St and Body shop shaving creams for years now. When I go this few weeks back and used it for the first time, other than the smell this cream is pretty useless. Lather is fine, but the skin does not moisture up. Keep lathering for longer times does not help either. The quantity also required to user per shave is huge, compared to bond or body shop. I am so disappointed with the product. In fact just to compare, I used over the counter Gillette shaving gel, and to my surprise that is better than this. So disappointed",0
This dryer dries my hair very quickly so there's less exposure to intense heat.  It's more quiet than other dryers too.,1
"heavenly smell. Not for very dry skin but works amazing on medium dry skin. No added parabens, phthalates or mineral oil is an added bonus.",1
"I bought this product from my dermatologist and was very disappointed. I used the product twice a day for a week and had a really bad reaction. The skin under my eyes became very red, dry, scaly, and itchy. I stopped using the product and waited for my skin to heal and then tried the product again. I had the same reaction the second time after only using the product for two days.

I understand that some products will cause an allergic reaction in some people. But I expect that for a product that claims a money back guarantee and costs $50 that I could return the product if I had a problem. Neither my dermatologist or the company would give me my money back. I wrote to the company several times describing the problem and offerig to return the unused portion of the product, but the company never responded.

Don't waste your money on this product, the company's money back guarantee doesn't mean a thing.",0
Love this facial spray. It is very refreshing especially during the summer. Wish they sold this by the gallon!,1
"I'm in LOVE with this color, especially as someone who needs to wear neutral colors a lot for professional reasons. The color looks good on any skin tone and can be worn in any season. Buy before they sell out!",1
Incredible make-up brush cleaner.  It doesn't take much and does a great job.  I haven't found another product to match it.,1
Made my face super red and highly allergic to it,0
not worth the money it has poor suction.,0
"I discovered this eye shadow many years ago and I've continued to purchase it to this day.  It has the perfect amount of shine and shimmer to it without an extravagant use of glitter.  Since this color is perfect for work, casual, or going out, this is my go-to eye shadow that I wear for every occasion.",1
Not as expected,0
I received this. It's a for men. I really disappointed for this,0
"I bought my friend the AoS sample size kit for Christmas and he really enjoyed it. Having used the balm sample up, he bought this bottle. Phew---stinky. The sample had a lovely sandalwood scent that wasn't heavy but rich. This is weakly sandalwood fragrance, with more chemical overtone and plastic smell than sandalwood. Not worth the money for sure.",0
Love these lip patches. Only reason I didn't do 4 stars is they don't quite fit/stay on my lips while Im using them. I think it might be that they're geared towards womens lips. So if there was a male alternative Id love to try,1
"This is a powerful blowdryer. works great. price is good. feels a little heavy, especially if you have long hair, but overall its a great product! just get someone else to do your hair. (its more fun that way anyway :)  )",1
"I love that this cleanser comes out of the container as a soft fluffy foam. Washing your face has never been easier.

My skin is weather-damaged from years spent in the sun. The cleanser does slightly soften out the finer lines, as far as wrinkles go, but it is temporary. I don't expect any product to perform miracles, even over time, so I really am happy with what the cleanser actually can do.

Because the product is oil-free, it does not moisturize my skin, but it does make my face feel soft and clean.
I follow cleansing with my regular face cream, and I'm happy with the results, which are as good as I can hope for at my age. (Mid-sixties.)",1
"Item stopped working after 5 mos
Wont hold a charge
Yes, I did troubleshoot item",0
useless,0
Not at all happy with this as the size of the product is only sample size and way too much money for it.,0
burns/irritates my face..i have issues with rosacea and this product definitely worsens things,0
I am very disappointed in this product. I received it about 2 weeks after I ordered it. I tried to polish my nails with the product a few days later and the polish was very sticky. I had to remove it and haven't used it since.  I have had this brand before and have never had this problem.,0
"This came without the flipper part, the box only contained the remover.",0
"I've been happy with other Pur Minerals products, but this was a real disappointment.  No matter how little I brushed on, it made my skin appear dirty instead of giving me a healthy tanned look.",0
"Very gentle, soothing to skin, smells great, lasts forever! Won't let skin feeling dry and yet cleanses well. Very good product",1
Really like this product made my hair a lot Fuller than it usually is I will dye it again,1
Excellent,1
Makes a good gift.,1
I have tried almost every gel / wax and this is amazing!!! A tub wil last a long time as you only need a little bit. Only negative about this size is that the pump cloggs up and broke when i tried to clean it.,1
"AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL! NO NO NO!!! I did not purchase this product on Amazon, I purchased it at ""Ricky's"" in New York City, a store similar to Ulta, which supposedly sells authentic beauty products. I don't doubt the authenticity of the product I purchased. I do believe many of the straighteners sold on Amazon as high-end products are actually imitation products from China. However, just as one would but something from Sephora and believe it to be authentic, I believe my purchase from Rick's NYC was an authentic Babyliss product, and my opinion is that this hair product was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. It is no different than $20 Conair or Remington flat irons. My photos speak for themselves--the plates on the iron do not touch, and therefore the hair will not straighten evenly. What a waste of $140! I left the box at my workplace, so I'm not sure I will even be able to return it. I'm so annoyed that I was duped by the hype, and may have lost all that money. How hard is it to manufacture an iron with plates that lay flat against one another??? What is the solution? I don't know. I will continue to search for a decent flat iron.",0
I used to use this cleanser daily for years. But then DDF shrunk the packaging by 29% and kept the price the same. I can't continue to purchase it feeling like they're duping customers.,0
"Very gentle on my sensitive, acne-prone, aging skin.  It is expensive, so, I can't give it five stars.",1
I've used this product for years.  I didn't reailze it came in a larger size so was excited to find this.,1
"i love this polish, great color & lonevity!",1
"Texture, smell, quality all are excellent and we don't use another since we tried this one. We used this since my boy is born in his first bath and till now he is 8months old. Together with this products, cleansing,foam shampoo, lotion are highly recommended for every mom...This facial one is perfect for my little son face from dryness of winter...",1
Great feel/balance = great shave. Second Merkur razor I have purchased (I wanted a 3 piece construction).,1
watered down of the original.,0
Not happy!,0
Deep cleaning without drying...love it!,1
Does not cure well at all.  Left under UV light 4 times as long as my other shellac polishes and it still comes out tacky.  Disappointed.,0
"BE WARNED THEY DID NOT SEND ME THE RIGHT KIT.  THEY SENT ME THE RETAIL PACKAGE VERSION NOT DESIGND FOR CARRY ON!  Annoying because I fly out of country in 2 days.  So I get shorted a little shaving cream, and a carry on bag that they charged an extra 5 bucks for.  Love the product, just want the right one",0
"Would recommend this mascara to everyone.  easy to apply, never smudges and easily washes off with soap or water.  once applied stays on all day.",1
I have the Dr. Dense (from QVC) microdermabrasion unit (looks and works just like this one). The Dr. Dense unit MUCH CHEAPER!!! I paid $99 and no shipping during a QVC special. I do not know if QVC still carries the unit but would be worth it to check. I watched the infomercial on Nubrilliance this morning and am very concerned that they show the people using the unit COMPLETELY WRONG. Made me mad watching it show people gliding it across their faces. You do upward and inward motions. Hold skin taut. Never do downward strokes on your face.  You do short quick strokes. I don't trust this unit or the customer service associated with it.,0
"Have used Furterer products in the past and have been very happy with their quality.  However, I was extremely disappointed with the Shine Enhancing Shampoo and Conditioner.  I have straight, fine hair and thought this would be great to boost shine.  Instead, it left my hair greasy and flat.  The last straw was after several uses, yesterday I dried my freshly washed hair and it had the appearance of having been unwashed for 3-4 days.  Definitely expect more for the cost.  I am returning both.  Maybe this works better for thicker or more curly hair, but if you have straight or fine hair, stay away.",0
"I have rosy redness in some areas of my cheeks (likely rosacea) and wanted to try a product to address it.  I don't like to wear makeup so I was looking for a product that would go on lightly, blend in, and reduce the appearance of the redness.  This does just that - I put it on the red areas by blending it completely into my skin.  It's very light - if you put too much on, it will appear green so a little goes a long way. It remained on for most of the day, only a little touch up needed later in the day at work.",1
"This candle smokes terribly.  I know all about trimming the wick, etc. as I have multiple candles in my home.  The scent is barely there and the presentation looks cheap.  The glass top simply has a sticker affixed as does the rim around the container that the candle is in.  The sides of the candle look as if they have melted and re-solidified.  I am a big fan of Trapp candles and thought this Archipelago would be a good choice.  It was a waste of money.  Looks like something from the Dollar Store and performs poorly.  Save your money and choose something else.",0
"This lotion is great, has ingredients similar to products I use on my face, and has worked wonders on my dry skin. I will definitely continue using this lotion.",1
I like this item.  I am fairly young to be experiencing this issue but it never hurts to be forewarned and forearmed so they say.  It smells pleasant and I use it after every bath.  I do like to tan so it's probably for the best.,1
Did not work.,0
"Love this stuff!  It foams up on your face and feels really good while its ""working"".  Leave skin clean and fresh",1
"Like most wet shavers I purchased my original gear at Art of Shaving and paid way too much.  This soap lasts 6+ months, lathers up well but does dry after a short time which can be a problem if you use a straight razor and take your time.  Its fine with a safety razor, guess I am just slow.  I have never used  sandalwood fragrances in the past but I do like this one.  Have received several compliments on the smell, but it is gone after a couple of hours.",1
the bottle was open when the package was opened and a lot of the liquid  fell out,0
"Ryan is 100% right with everything.  I personally will not purchase it again because I tried other natural sunscreens that are easier to get out of the tube that won't irritate my eyes and provide great coverage.  One more pro to this lotion is it doesnt' smell awful like many of the other natural sunscreens.  I recommend Blue Lizard definately, or Alba Botanica as my second choice.",1
I first saw this brand on birch box- I hate smelling like sunscreen. COOLA has great scents! My favorite is this vanilla. I love the non greasy spray on- it really helps me to use more frequently and take care of my skin. AND ORGANIC! knowing that I'm not poisoning myself is a bonus too. I use sunscreen much more frequently now because of this great product!! All it takes is a quick spray.,1
Great  for melasma- this product did a great job with reducing dark hyperpigementation about 2-3 shades! I did however find the formula to be a bit tacky after drying.  My  own personal formula that works for me (I will share with you) and  trust me I have tried EVERYTHING!!  I use this product in conjunction with Mario Badescu's  Glycolic acid wash (1xwk) and Glycolic toner (morning and night) as well as DermaE skin lighten creme (morning and night) and a tiny scoop of Turbo Booster C Powder by Philosophy in your moisturizer.  Together these products are AMAZING at lightening up even the most stubborn hypermentation!,1
"Dermablend Quick-Fix Concealer Stick is as great as the rest of the Dermablend  product line. The applicator disperses the product easily and that helps with those quick make-up fixes! The concealer stick make up is just as easy to apply onto the skin. It's very smooth and silky and blends well into the skin. I've worked with other products that were much heavier and unnatural, so the smoothness of the product is a big plus to experience with the Dermablend stick. I should also add that I've worked with some make-up sticks that are fragile and break off, not this one. It is firm and appears like it will last until the very end.

It definitely covers dark circles well and doesn't patch up around the eyes, which is another big  attribute. After proper application, the product lasts long and wears well for hours. My only concern, thus, the one missing star, is although I've had no breakouts or irritation from the brand, my face, where I apply the product, feels a bit slicker than the rest of my face. Of course, everyone is different and will experience different results.",1
Not impressed. No noticeable new hair growth.,0
This can't be the regular tea tree conditioner.  It smells weird.,0
"It was the size I needed, heats up fast and gives long hair full wavy curls. Good value for the price. My naturally straight hair does not hold the curl for very long but this tool does what is expected and is easy to use. I also like that it is gold in color!",1
After using some other Oribe products I expected great things. It left my hair feeling like it had a film on it.,0
"Does not have auto off.. Learned that after coming home one day and having my husband freak out that it was still on.
Other than that. is great!",1
"I used this product and had a severe allergic reaction. I have never been allergic to anything before. Redness and intense itching. Can't use it so it was a waste of money. No reflection on the seller, just the product. Wanted to leave zero stars.",0
A little too sweet and berry for me-,0
This product is oily. It is easy to rub out of mud on the face and finally made it impossible to do further make up. The sun blocking effect is not obvious as well.,0
"This is super lightweight and does not sting (some eye creams sting my sensitive skin) and wears well under makeup!  I see a difference in the dark circles for sure, but maybe not so much in the wrinkles--those might be past the point of helping--but that's the only reason for 4 stars and not 5.",1
"This leaves crazy amounts of black stringy fuzz all over my face. I followed the directions and washed it before using it the first time. Yet it still left many long black pieces of fuzz on my face, including pieces that got into my eyes. Super uncomfortable and I had to spend time picking fuzz out of my eyes. Gross. Did it remove my makeup? Yes. But it's not worth it because of the fuzz.",0
"I received this kit as a gift and like it a lot. While I am generally not a person who likes to shave or likes to be clean shaven, this kit makes it an enjoyable task. I give it 4 stars because I am not crazy about the oil or the after shave balm. However, the brush, while a new concept to me, is fantastic. The shave cream is great and the razor is as well.",1
"Instead of moisturizing, it dried my lips. It feels very synthetic.",0
"The item that I received was not the correct brush and it was used. The brush was discolored, smelled like soap and several bristled were misshaped.",0
"I have extremely dry skin and this has been my holy grail for years! I use it on my face and random parts of my body. When you first apply, it seems heavy but it absorbs quickly into the skin and keeps it hydrated all day.",1
"I cannot praise this flat iron enough! If you're on the fence about which one to buy, this is THE ONE. I certainly didn't want to spend this kind of money on a flat iron, initially. I had purchased another Babyliss at Ulta for $180. Not this one, but another. Let me tell you something. It didn't hold a candle to this one. I returned it and bought this one on Amazon. This is an investment and a very good one. My ""old"" flat iron apparently had a small chip in it and ruined my hair. Spit and tore it up. I just had to have three inches cut off. That is when I went on the hunt for a titanium flat iron. It's amazing. I have thick, wavy hair and it glides thru like butter. You'll be so happy with this. I sing its praises.  Enjoy!",1
"This has been the only cream that keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day. I work in a freezing cold office so I have a personal space heater that really dries out the air and my skin, but after using this moisturizer I've really felt a difference in my skin. I used to use the super thick Nivea original cream from Germany but this works so much better and without making your face look shiny and greasy.",1
"So my friend swears by this and she got me to try it out.  All of my girlfriends and I are constantly trying out new products and sharing ideas, our husbands are lost, but then I don't know if I really get fishing either so I suppose we're even :P I use Retinol in at least one other product I use for wrinkles that has worked great.  If you're concerned about having nice skin and keeping it that way, you should check out my fave five look young products:

I can't turn back the clock, but I'm not going down without a fight either!",1
AWESOME!!!  Going to recommend this to everyone I know on a well water system!,1
very pretty color,1
"On mu second bottle.  Love this shampoo and the conditioner and mouse,.  Makes my 76 year old hair much thicker and I get so many compliments.",1
"Horrible product!! Tried curling my daughter's hair after Santa delivered this for Christmas, and it did nothing for her hair. Back to the North Pole and the traditional flipper iron we go!",0
I have been using this for a long time I think it helps my skin.,1
This Calvin Klein Eau de  toilette spray smells different than the test strip from catalog---i hope this was not a conterfeit!!!!!!!,0
Ver y good!!,1
"I normally love hot tools especially as a professional.  My other hot tools have lasted at least two years.  This one however just stopped working on me yesterday.  I plug it in,  switch the on button and it doesn't turn on.  It has lasted not even two and half months.  I only use it twice a week to curl my hair. It should of lasted longer.",0
"Goes on and doesn't have a heavy feel. It smells really nice. With this sunscreen, you really need to reapply every 2 hours. No white cast, it feels light. After applying my face feels a little bit damp until it soaks in.",1
"I was kind of disappointed with this lip balm. I live in a really dry climate and I have to put lip balm on every night before bed. I decided to try this one because our Target stopped carrying the one I was using before (Alba Coconut Cream). I had to order it online, so I decided to try this one instead.

It has a nice smell and a nice taste. It's thick and rich and it moisturizes. But I just didn't feel like it moisturized as well as the Alba lip balm. I also missed the coconut flavor.",1
"I have been so unhappy with this iron.  I bought one in August 2015 and it burned out in Oct 2015, Amazon replaced it but now it us Feb and the 2nd one burned out.  Very disappointed.  Hot Tools must have changed because the one I had before all these issues lasted for a few years and I had loved that one.",0
"Not overpowering, very subtle and lasts all day.
Love it and always get numerous questions about what fragrance I am wearing.
Have purchased this fragrance more than once.",1
"I was looking for a cheaper alternative for my Obagi Elastiderm eyecream, which I use all over my face and neck, and thought with the reviews  on the Blue Copper I'd give it  a try. It mositurizes really well but ,it broke me out something awful. I didn't even finish the half of the jar before I gave it away. If you even moderately to mildly break out, I'd say pass on this one. It even broke my neck out, which has never happened.",0
Love this wash it makes our kitchen feel like a spa,1
Good for everyday use. Overpriced for the size though.,1
I have used this before and I am very pleased with the results.,1
"If you have thin, fine hair like I do, this may be a good product to try.  It has definitely given my hair more body.  I have medium length fine hair and I am going to continue to use the product.",1
Nothing like the original Brush! The quality is reall cheap and doesn't compare!,0
Great product,1
Absolutely not worth it. The product did not whiten my teeth after almost 3 months of using it religiously. I followed the instructions step by step so I can honestly say it simply does as much or less than any regular whitening toothpaste. AVOID.,0
Great product!,1
"If you are thinking about buying a hot tools iron and have hard to curl hair don't worry they are great and well worth the money.  I bought my first one about 20 years ago and have loved them ever since.  The gold ones are the best, I did buy some of the purple Teflon ones those weren't as good.  The heat range is great but be careful when you first get it.  Don't crank it up to top temp immediately test it at different temps on your hair.  Turning up too high can burn your hair if not careful.  Keep the replacement springs, you will need them after a while.  The only thing I would say is a draw back for me is I tend to hit the on off switch when curling my hair a lot.  I wish it was in a different spot like on the bottom.  But because I'm aware that I constantly turn if off I check constantly now.  Funny story I once got someone else's bag at the airport and she got mine.  When we got our own bags back the only thing missing out of my bags were my two hot tools curling irons.  I guess she loved them enough to steal them.",1
I ordered a night cream and received a day cream.,0
"Be forewarned. Flimsy, flimsy wand. Great product in cheap packaging. Hoping to use up product before wands breaks completely. Disappointed ",0
"I bought this product after reading so many great reviews on it helping acne. I have acne prone/combo skin so I figured it would help with my acne & oil. I first tried it and notice that it dried out my skin a bit, especially areas around my mouth and the creases on the side of my nose. Skin started peeling on the side of my nose after the 1st week and when I would put on mosturizer it would sting/burn so bad. I used this product twice a day for nearly a month and it broke me out SO BAD. I wouldn't recommend using it and save yourself from breaking out and dry skin!!",0
Love the towels. They are easy easy to use. I don't care for the spray color. It's brown and I prefer the clear. A friend of mine has the same items and her spray is clear. Not sure why some is brown.,1
"Works very well, the treatment is kind of a pain to do and rinse out and makes my hair feel like straw afterwards. I deep condition after using these, but they help strip the minerals out of your hair and perk up my blonde!",1
"this muted sage green is a nice color for spring. it is a sort of pastel celery color, one that I wouldn't usually be attracted to but one that I've been enjoying lately. I expected this to clash with my pale-end-of-medium skintone, but it actually looks nice. this sort of odd color is really interesting on the nails. the pro-wide brush from OPI makes application easier and this polish requires two coats.",1
"Shipped on time, item exactly as described. I love this color on my nails. Perfect summer color to wear. Also love the shimmer.",1
"Hands down, the best straightener I have ever used! Glides effortlessly and leaves hair silky and smooth. Highly recommended!",1
"I just used it today for the first time, so I'm not sure how long it lasts. I will try to update my review once I've used it a few times and see how long it lasts. But my first impression is pretty good. Other than the weird sparkly stuff in it that makes you look like a vampire from the twilight series,  it seems pretty awesome. Prior to this I've been using a drugstore product and this is a big upgrade. The color is more of a reddish brown instead of an orangey brown like with some other  self tanners. The oil is also pleasant to use and doesn't have an offending  smell. But it does dry extremely fast, so I recommend doing small areas. Like lower leg first, then upper leg, etc. With the drugstore product I could always just lather over my entire leg all at once. But this dries way too fast. So far very happy.",1
Wife says it smells like burnt sugar,0
i love it.,1
Snags on your hair too much!  Ouchies,0
"I'll be honest ...this eye liner surprised me.  I don't wear eye liner often anymore with 3 small kids at home.  My days are brutal and my time for makeup is EXTREMELY limited.  I need to do my makeup in about 42 seconds.  I don't have time to wipe off and reapply if it smudges.  I also have super oily skin. Therefore, typically - eye liner runs, smudges and is a general hot mess.

This was a pleasant surprise.  Not only did this eye liner last through a day of sweat, dirt and life with 3 boys - but it also lasted at the pool in 100+ degree weather.

Consider me impressed!",1
"I bought this on half year ago from eBay seller, it's work perfectly. So I order it again from Amazon. When I receive it. I found it does not heat on 220V country(specification is 110-240V), just warm. I think I receive the defect item so I return it and order it again. But I found another one still have same problem. So I think the whole batch is same. It can't work on 220V properly.",0
I'm disappointed that this set came with only 6 toothpastes.,0
Not sure if its the smell or the very mist that really does make me wake up :D,1
Boyfriend loved it. I love it. He smells great. Can't keep my hands off him.,1
Not worth the money.  Cannot see where it is any better than another conditioner.  Leaves the hair really tangled and hard to comb through without breaking a lot of strands.  Did not give my hair any more body than any other conditioner.,0
The smell is intoxicating! Feminine and masculine at the same time so that everyone can enjoy!,1
"Amazing product. Better than any product out in your local store. You literally only need one drop to clean you whole face, And it leaves it feeling rejuvenated. I tend to never find a product that I can use and be one hundred percent satisfied to continue to use regularly. However this product is the one.",1
"I had this exact same razor that I used for years, with the exception that it had a CLOSED comb. I had to replace it because of an unfortunate drop from the top of my medicine cabinet. It landed at an odd angle and the handle broke off from the head. I loved that razor, so I wanted to get the same model. I took a chance on the OPEN comb, and am very glad that I did! Excellent, excellent shave. Maybe not for beginners of wet shave, but for the experienced wet shaver, I doubt you could find a closer shave from another razor. I whole heartedly recommend this razor. Merkur is top notch quality, and this razor is fantastic!",1
I bought the 1 1/2 inch iron. I like the fact that it's ceramic. It feels nice and smooth on my hair when curling. It heats up fast and provides lasting results. My only dislike would be that the temperature dial is very loose and in the area were my fingers naturally sit. So I found myself hitting the temperature dial and changing the temperature unknowingly. It would be nice if it was clicking at each temperature or if it wasn't so loose. I have to keep an eye on it to make sure I don't accidentally move it too hot.,1
"I would never use this product again, very iritating",0
"After almost one month of using this product morning and afternoon, I felt no improvement in my skin, it was very frustrating to realize that I paid a lot of money for a product that does not bring any benefit. I definitely do not recommend.",0
Love it. Wish it was cheaper.,1
"Easy, sheer. Got me covered!",1
"Yummy, smells so good. I wanted to spray something in my hair to have it smell extra nice but not smell overwhelming. Something nice and pretty, feminine and soft for when I'm giving a hug to my someone special. He loves it.",1
"This shaving cream is for people that care about shaving, and what they put on their face.  It lathers great, shaves great, and smells awesome.",1
Good perfume at a good price!,1
"Disappointed. Very mild fragrance, does not stay very long, ordinary feel. My hair does not feel better than shampoos I can buy in Target and Walmart.",0
"Works really well, but so expensive for such a tiny little bottle",1
Didn't like this product.,0
So bad,0
"I have been using this product for about two years.  I put it on in the am after washing my face then apply my moisturizer/sunscreen. I love this product!  After having laser treatments, as my aesthetician recommend it. It is a wonderful serum and antioxidant.",1
"Scent is off, I have worn for years and used this bottle I got this Christmas for the first time and didn't smell right, my husband was the first to make a comment.",0
"Fantastic saturated color, but it has a rough finish that can catch.  Two coats of top coat will reduce it greatly, but it takes forever to dry.  The polish lasts about three days before it begins to chip off.",1
"There may be some counterfeit versions of this out there. I've used this product for years, but the new bottle I just got from Amazon had a darker plastic container and also had a weird odor - like rank perfume. The color of the lotion was the same as my old bottle but the smell was definitely different. There were also some subtle differences in the packaging. Previously I bought the product from Sephora, which charged more but never sent me a bootleg product.",0
Helps great with dark circles and discoloration,1
Left my hair dry,0
"This dryer broke within months of receiving it. This is my 3rd standup dryer made from this company. I finally got the old school dryer and chair setup because i was tired of throwing money away on these things. IMO, not worth it and cheaply made heating components.",0
"did try ones , it had burning sensation on my skin and the hear grow again , would not recommend",0
"Junk!  It's not Paul Mitchell, see pic.  Unlike other reviews I don't even think it smells good, it smells cheap.",0
The spray nossle does not work. ,0
"Absolutely love this body wash. Smells great and  cleans really well. It is very much as described but be warned that if you don't like the smell of a cigar lounge (tobacco not the smoke) stay away. If you like that smell, definitely go for it.",1
"Beautiful Eyeliner. Hands down. It has some misses but I generally like this product.
The brush is awesome; so thin and creates the perfect wing. I've been getting a lot of compliments of my eyeliner and honestly this brush is everything.

The formula is a liquid that dries to a dry matte-- almost eyeshadow but not loose at all. It dries pretty fast too. It looks beautiful in pictures and I love that. I have it in coffee (the brown) and its different from the normal black liner which i like.

Only gripe I have is that it smudges on my eyes throughout the day. It's not super smudgy but I do notice by end of the night I see it on my lower lashes/eye area which it find kind of weird. But figuring that the eyeliner is semi-powder it makes sense.

Would I repurchase? Possibly, I prefer this over a little more than my KVD Tattoo Liner, but both are beatiful. KVD is semi matte; it does have a shine where as the Em Scribble liner is more matte.

If the price point was a little lower, I think this eyeliner would perfect. I was fortunate enough to get it for $12 with shipping on their black friday sale which was awesome.",1
"Mario Badescu products are a bit of a luxury for me. I'm more of a buy-one get-one-free kind of shopper.  But there are a few exceptions to my normal thrifty beauty product purchases, and this mask is one of them.  It smells wonderful, not too strong and natural, not artificial-smelling. It works equally well for my fairly dry over-40 skin and my 22 year old daughter's combination skin. You will feel refreshed and relaxed after using this mask. My face always feels invigorated and soft after using the Strawberry Tonic Mask.",1
Sorry. These did not work for me at all and the color polish I used on top made by Butter chips the very day I put it on. Very disappointing. Especially for the money.,0
Sad to say that this product was a no-go for me. Became cakey and unsightly after an hour. Tried it for week with different application methods and each time I had to go to bathroom at work and wash it off before lunch because I looked like a clown. Definitely would not recommend for combination skin.,0
I have very oily skin and really like this product.  A little goes a long while (a dime-size is plenty for my face).  My skin tolerated the 5-2 cleanser well so I tried and am now using the stronger 10-2 cleanser :),1
This probably more an error on my part but I have a really hard time getting my curls to stay with this curling iron. Probably because the barrel is larger. Not sure.,1
"It smells ""good,"" but for gosh sake its a cologne, that doesnt get it any stars.

This bottle smells like a nice light coat of baby powder. That's it. It lasts all day (6-8 hours in ac ool room) and I do ""like"" the smell, but it is very typical and bland. It has no character even compared to other mass-produced and heavily worn colognes.

I wear it to work because its very simple, unoffensive, and... well... I cant return it, so I may as well use it. If I were going on a date or out on the town, this would be my last choice.",0
Not as expected,0
I like the product but the packaging is defective.  You have to squeeze the tube to get the lotion and with this particular one nothing comes out until you squeeze really hard and then it gushes out....way too much.  I have used this product for several years and have never had a problem before.  I contacted Avene and they were aware of this faulty packaging and thought all of the defective ones had been removed.  So buyer beware!  I am unable to return mine so I will waste a lot of the product.,0
This curling iron heats up really quick and works well. I think I will go with a slightly smaller barrel next time.,1
"Sprayer clogs after first use, could not be cleaned or removed -- even with a pin.",0
This curling iron catches hair and does not heat up like I was hoping for. I should have spent a little more and gotten a better product. Poor quality!,0
Great,1
Made my throat swell when I accidentally got some on my lips and mouth.,0
"I love shaving with this razor! First off, don't expect to haul balls and shave really quick like you would with a Mach 3 or a Quattro. You have got to take your time. Let your face get warm from a shower or a hot wash, then lather on your shaving cream for the warmed up brush, then apply the razor very gently. It takes some time but it feels amazing. I use the Proraso shaving cream in a tube and I use clubman aftershave. With this blade and those various things, it's such a great save that I want to turn around and shave again in a few hours. It feels that good. It's like eating a cooked meal as opposed to a microwave meal. I kid you not it is super fun to shave with a safety razor.",1
"I don't typically post reviews on products that I buy, but I figure I should since I had such a negative experience. Some background: I have had hormonal acne since my early teens and continue to have it at 24 yrs old...not so fun! I also have pretty oily skin. I had tried apple cider vinegar, Retin A, Proactiv, Clinique acne products, Mary Kay-- you name it, and I've likely tried it. After not having success with any of the aforementioned, I was looking forward to trying Mario Badescu's kit, as the esthetician at Ulta recommended it and I saw good reviews for it. At first, the kit did seem to dry my skin out and clear my acne a bit, but after 2 or so weeks passed by, all hell broke loose on my forehead. I hadn't broken out as badly for 10 years or so. It was AWFUL! I tried to use the sulfur mask as suggested and tried to get clear skin. Once the first breakout had started to heal, I got ANOTHER one on my forehead! (side note: it is not typical for me to break out during ovulation as I did with this kit...just around menstruation.) So, into the trash went this kit. It really took a hit on my self esteem, and I wish I had never tried it. It might work for you, but it was terrible for me!",0
These blades are not as sharp as they should be. Wilkinson Sword works much better for me and my razor.,0
nice,1
"It goes on smoothly but takes a couple of minutes to dry.  Once dry it is great, doesn't flake and looks good.  Getting it off doesn't take much, you can actually pull the mascara off your lashes!  When you use soap/make-up remover, the mascara will pile up onto itself and simply wipe away.",1
"This product really works. When I first tried it on, it looked really weird because it made me my lips looked all pale. I read the instructions again and did it right. It makes my lips look great, nice and natural. I don't use color lip liners anymore. This is my go to product. Also, this works great as a concealer. The trick is (instructions) to line the outside of your lips (not inside) then blend outward onto the skin not the lips.",1
Great! My pedicurist recommended and she was right. The better be coats don't bubble. Couldn't be happier with this product.,1
Excellent product at a good price.,1
"This is NOT the same stuff that I have purchased at Sephora for years.  They stopped carrying the line and I was thrilled to find that Amazon now carries it.  However, this is not the same stuff at all.  If you've been using TexasLash for any period of time, you know the smell of it and you know the consistency of it.  This is similar to regular, store bought mascara and performs like it.  I love the original stuff, but it's almost like someone replaced this with a different mixture or just labeled the tube with the cargo logo.  The wand isn't even the same.

It did come in typical packaging, so I would have expected it to be the actual stuff.  Sadly, it's not. Save your pennies and head to Sephora for something else.",0
This is a really good deodorant without all the harsh chemicals that are in most deodorants out there. I have been using this deodorant for a while and I must say I'm very pleased with this product. It goes on the skin clear and the smell is fragrance free which is good. I must say that this deodorant is a product that i plan on purchasing over and over again because it is such a good quality deodorant.,1
Great shampoo for the price,1
Worked well but I thought was way too heavily perfumed. Wish came in a no fragrance version. I try to keep fragrance away from my skin as it irritates it. Try to keep my brushes clean for this reason but the perfume negates the benefit of having the clean brush. Felt like the scent was so lingering that it would be irritating on my skin.,0
Bad quality.,0
"The texture is great. The smell is a little overpowering for me. I put it on and the first time I thought it smelt like a bathroom freshener. I walked into the room where my husband was and he said ""Wow you smell awesome, what are you wearing""?...So now I love the smell! Just took some getting used to.",1
this is not what it says it is it says cream there for it should be lotion which its not it is has wash I work at Nissan and I ordered this because I wash my hands a lot and the lotion crabtree has is awesome my uncle that is a doctor uses it . Thought that's what I was getting and waited for it in the mail to turn out this was not what I got very upset.,0
We experienced this brand shampoo on a cruise with Holland America. Great fragrance and gentle. Conditioner and body wash also very good.,1
I love the color but I am disappointed. It's as if this nail polish is old. It's clumpy and not going on well. I always have to throw away my nail polishes when they get in this state. ;(,0
These rollers heat up fast and are a real time saver.,1
very good but my face seems to be a bit sensitive at this point.,1
"Great product, I love it",1
"This is a very well made, robust scrubber marketed for men. The charger it comes with is very convenient to use. After using it with the sample it came with, the skin feels tight and clean. Because it does well what it was made for, it removes layers of dead skin cells, and oils covering the skin. It is highly recommended to use  a moisturizer after each use. Although I like this product a lot, I must admit that I did not give it 5 stars, because its exorbitant price is not justifiable. I do not know how well this product sells, but I would imagine the price would be a deterrent for many people. After everything is said and done, it is just an electric brush...",1
"Exactly as advertised, cant say it did anything to make them longer but it definitely made them bolder which was exactly what i was going for!",1
"I have been a loyal Matrix Biolage customer for years, but they recently changed their formulas.  I always used HydraTherapie and loved it, but now it is called HydraSource and it is awful!  I would buy shampoo from the dollar store before I would ever put this on my hair again.  It completely ruined my hair, took all of the color out and put a waxy coating on my hair.  The shampoo/conditioner doesn't smell the same or have the same texture.  I wouldn't use this product even if I was given a lifetime supply for free - that's how bad it ruined my hair.",0
"If, according to the directions...30 seconds per spot on your head.  So my question is what happens at the pivot point at temple/ear area that gets 3 minutes or more of the laser treatment? Everywhere I look according to directions, there is a ""leave in place for a minimum of 30 seconds.""  Nowhere have I found what a maximum time would be...nor what a damaging level would be.  ""The entire treatment should be a minimum of 3 minutes.""
Looking for answers",0
"If you are a freak and want to turn your hair blue, I would recommend getting this along with X-Fusion black hair fibers. This applicator is weak and does not force hair fibers through and onto your scalp. You have to keep pressing it many times to see a little bit of blue fibers on your head.",0
Awesome product; does protect your hair before doing our hot iron; I hot iron my hair pretty much every day and my hair does not feel dry or damaged.,1
Overpriced with average results,0
"I normally love this mascara and buy it from here often, but for some reason the tube I got was either old or not sealed properly. It dried out and clumped within a week of receiving it. Not good for a $20+ mascara that is normally very high quality.",0
"THE PUMP HAS NEVER WORKED SO I HAD TO TRANSFER IT INTO A DIFFERENT BOTTLE.
VERY IRRITATING TO TRANSFER THIS!!!!!",0
"I have other products from this brand and they are good quality, however i think this particular one i got is either old or something is wrong with it. By looking at it u can tell the color separated, i had to rub the bottle in my hands to mix the color again. Once applying it it was very thick n had clumps in it. Besides this specific product the brand is excellent. I use the base coat and top gel with other colors and my nails look great for days!",0
Not really a fan of this product. I was hoping it would smell like the shampoo. It is moisturizing however.,0
"I have very curly, frizzy hair that I've been fighting with all of my life. I've tried everything from keratine treatments to straightening solutions. Neither of those treatments last and they leave my hair damaged. Wen is the best thing I've ever found and I must admit that I am extremely happy with my hair since I started using Wen.

I get into the shower and wet my hair. Then I put the Wen Cleansing Conditioner all over my head and rub it into my scalp and through my hair. I leave it on my hair while I finish my shower. Then, I rub it all through my hair again and scrub my scalp with it. I rinse thoroughly and if my hair needs more, I put more on, sometimes just where I feel like it still isn't clean. After I get out of the shower, I towel dry my hair. Then, I rub one pump of Wen's Six Thirteen through my hair and I blow it dry. My hair is silky smooth, with no frizz. I color my hair and Wen does not strip the color out of my hair either.

Friends and family members have told me ... Read more",1
Didn't see much of a difference,0
"thought I would find something a little less abrasive than the paul Mitchell platinum which
I like but though after a long time using it, was time to switch it up

overpriced garbage is my first reaction as I just dried my hair, which felt strawlike and
here's the real thing that is troublesome.  my very buttery light blonde hair, now has
gold running through it.....ugh.............the very thing this is supposed to NOT do

very disappointed right now..I will try it one more time, then its getting tossed out of here
in the land of disappointment",0
i am extremly angry that i have tried to contact the seller 2 times now and they will not contact me back. This was bought just before christmas and already won't get hot. Spend that kind of money on something and then it stop working in just months is a issue.,0
Wife likes it.  Most recommended by her previous pregnant friends.,1
"Does what its supposed to as far as reducing sun glare, however mine fell off and got lost after only a couple of weeks.  I wish they made a larger version that would stay put better. This is so small that you have to keep moving it around on the window to keep up with the shifting suns rays which is very dangerous and inconvenient to do while driving. I ended up sticking it up and letting it be. Worked great when it was in the right spot, but then it fell off and has been no used to me since.",0
"I've used this before in a salon & it lasted a lot longer when they did it. I don't know if this is not as good of quality or if it was really cold when it was shipped and that had something to do with it, but I was disappointed in this.",0
too oily,0
"I love blinc, but $26???

No...",1
"I am a professional hairstylist and this dyer is horrible! It is really heavy, more than 2 lbs. I burn myself and my clients all the time. The chord has somehow twisted itself so bad that It it impossible to untwist. ( I don't even wrap the chord around the dryer or anything)",0
"Great product! Powerful, but also very light.",1
"Well, I bought this as a gift with an electric razor for hubby. He loves his electric razor, but this stuff didn't do anything for him. I bought it based on the recommendations. Hubby has a VERY thick beard, and this didn't work for him. I guess it works great for men with average beards. It didn't gunk up the razor though. This stuff rinses right out.",0
not as good as advertised,0
"I've been using this product for several months now and have been very pleased.  It is truly unscented, the consistency is thick and creamy without being greasy at all.  It absorbs into the skin nicely and hydrates dry skin, especially in the winter.",1
This is my third Paul Mitchell iron to purchase. I have absolutely loved the other two that I owned. This one however is not as good of a product as the two previous ones I owned. When you close the iron around your hair the plates do not completely close together. I have very thin hair and my hair slides right through without being straitened. I can grip really tight on the iron but then it pulls my hair out. This iron heats up super fast and I love that it has a timer. It the plates met together when you closed the iron it would be the perfect flat iron. I do not know if the one I was shipped is just a defective product or if all of the irons are now made this way.,0
Perfect for touch ups in between coloring.,1
Its too obvious when worn,0
"My wife's review: I cant yet say that this product is the ""fountain of youth"" that LOccitane suggests it is, but what I can say is the oil feels great on my face. A little of this product goes a long way, which is a good thing because it's pricey. You don't need to apply much. I use it overnight, and the oil is absorbed by the skin with no grease residue. I have combination skin: different areas of my face are oily and dry. Using the product in the areas of my neck and around the eyes feels soothing, and maybe in time by continually feeding the skin with this product, I will see a youthful change in my overall skin tone. So far, after two weeks, that hasn't happened, but this oil would be a great alternative to a night crme.",1
"I got this because so many people raved about it but I had an allergic reaction.  There are only a few things I'm allergic to and I've never had an allergic reaction from using anything on my skin.  I think the sunscreen interacted something I was using and it literally burned my skin.  Someone said it looked like a chemical peel.  I couldn't put anything on my skin for a week.

After the allergic reaction, I just didn't want to use it again.",0
"I ordered this shaving cream through Amazon when my previous container finally ran dry.  The first, which had been purchased at one of the Art of Shaving stores, was outstanding.  This one, however, has a distinctly different odor that is not at all the same and clearly is not what was intended.  It has a rancid, industrial stench that is unbearable.  So needless to say it gets the lowest possible rating and the product will not be used.  That said, the original version purchased at one of the stores was outstanding.

*** Update:  Upon visiting one of the stores I was informed that they have changed the product.  Apparently the odor must be a result of this since the shaving cream at the store also smells like a burning rubber basketball.  It's really a shame - it had been the best shaving cream I'd ever used.",0
"I love this oil. Smells great and makes my hair SO smooth/soft. I paid substantially more for this stuff at Ulta, so when I found this item here, I ordered three. What a deal! The bottles arrived packaged well enough...each little bottle was individually wrapped and everything seemed fine...until I tried to use one. The pump didn't work. *pump pump pump* Nothing. Bummer. Okay, no biggie...I have two more. Tried the next one, same problem. Then the last one....didn't work. NOT ONE of the three bottles would pump out the oil. ??!! Not worth it to return, so now I have to uncap it and pour it out. Yeah, I'll just pay more at Ulta for this moving forward.",0
Didn't notice a big difference,0
Great color,1
"This shaving soap performs well and has a light, pleasant smell.",1
Did nothing. An absolute disappointment and a waste of money.,0
"I have light skin, but not skin that I would consider very fair-- this product has a rosy pinkish tint that is very unflattering. It does have great coverage for being so light but the color is a real deal breaker. I've therefore stuck to using it as a way to define my jawline. If I use it all over my face it is very obvious as it is nowhere near the shade of my neck or chest.",0
"I have been struggling with adult acne for years. I'm in my thirties, but my skin was worse than some teens, until I used this kit. It took awhile, about a month, but it really works. I found the lotion too sticky so I am not using that and I actually bought the full strength apple peel and like it better than the sample in this kit, but it is worth trying! I now use the wash, blemish serum, and apple peel and my skin looks and feels better than it has in years. It also makes me feel good to not be adding a ton of drying, irritating chemicals to my skin.",1
"Since I love Framesi's Biogenol Ultra Deep Masque conditioner, I expected their shampoo would also be superior. I can't tell that it's any different than ones sold in stores for half the price.",0
"I was expecting a ton from this deodorant, especially due to the price. I just have smelly pits because rarely does this stuff last long enough. Usually after a few hours of work, I can smell B.O. This has turned into my ""going out"" deodorant because if there is not a lot of activity done, I won't smell anything bad. Im really just trying to get through it all. Should have just bought one. Mitchum Smart Solid Clinical Performance, anti-perspiring and deodorant invisible stick Unscented is the way to go for me.",0
"This is a great product!  My skin looks better than ever-more refined, sun damage and spots are almost invisible.  I use it every night and sometimes during the day under my sun screen and foundation.  I will continue to use this product!",1
"The light occasionally won't flash when I pull the trigger. I will wait several seconds before removing the laser from the treatment area, then it will flash. Other times, it will flash automatically when I place it on the treatment area, which it isn't supposed to do. It is also very stubborn when I try to shut it off, forcing me to press it on my skin several times to get a few (automatic) flashes out before it will let me turn it off. I will be returning this product IMMEDIATELY as I'm concerned about the safety of using it. Guess I'll be trying the more expensive TRIA next.",0
Great product when applied but the powder broke up in pieces in the compact .,1
Perfect,1
"I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.  i have been using this product for a few weeks and the acne has come to a complete halt.  The jury is still out long term, but, so far so good. I am very happy with it.",1
Broke after a month and a half - 30 day return policy! Wont buy again,0
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE the color. I tried this on at Sephora and I don't know how to explain it but the Sephora sampler did not dry out as much as this product, making me feel like it is different somehow. It's in the same vial, with the same applicator, but the actual product was not the same. Even with lip primer, the color dried on streaky and flakey not at ALL like the sampler at Sephora that made me want to buy it.
I still recommend Stila and this lovely coral color, but I would definitely be buying my makeup from Sephora or Macy's etc.",0
"A little heavy, but still makes it easier to curl long hair. I have shoulder issues and this really helps. The curls look great but when you slip the curler out, pull down slightly and it will make the curls a little softer and not so corkscrew like. The curls look better the next day if you are fortunate enough to have the kind of hair that does not need to be washed every day.",1
"This product has a lovely scent and cleaned my hair and scalp, however I found that any claims for it being a silver highlighter did not come true for me.  I used it a dozen times and if anything I feel like it dried out my ends but any brightening or removal of yellowing on those ends never occurred.",0
"I can't feel the razor's edge protruding between the two parts (top & bottom plates) sandwiching the razor. My results when shaving is nothing near a close shave. At best it leaves a shadow. I'm holding out hope that it is my operator trouble because, my goodness, what a great feeling hardware. Sturdy and well made. I just can't feel the blade.",0
"Seems to be good so far but I however have not experienced any peeling of my skin like a YouTube video said would occur in order for your skin to be even, but it has cleared up my black spots and the bumps on my face, just make sure you moisturize after.",1
"I haven't really decided if I really love this cream. It isn't terrible, but it isn't my all-time favorite either. It feels a little heavy on my face, and I can't tell if I started to get little bumps along my hairline because of this cream or just because it is summer and my face gets warm.

The instructions say to apply generously, where many creams suggest a tiny amount. It moisturizes well, but I think it would be better suited to my winter skin. It seems to sit on top of my skin and not soak in on my face. When I tried it on my hand, it soaked in. I think it really depends on the amount of moisture your skin needs.

For the most part, the ingredients are natural, which I prefer. I give it high marks for that. In fact, that's why I rated it four stars instead of three.

The smell reminds me of cocoa butter, or tanning lotion. It is not unpleasant. I like that it isn't flowery. I'm not sure if it was added fragrance of if it comes from the ingredients, but I never understand why it's necessary to have a fragrance (if it was indeed added and not natural to the ingredients).",1
This makes my hair crunchy and DOES NOTHING FOR humidity.  A waste of money. I could have spent 1/4 the money at any store and gotten the same results. BUYER BEWARE!,0
Works very well. Gets very hot and curls like it's supposed to.,1
"This is the best clay pomade i have ever used, and when i say the best, believe me i'm right. I have tried in past bumble & bumble, all redkens, kiehl's, american crew, kms and many more and neither any of them give me the look i wanted to. i'm commun guy with short-mid hair. you would think that you just have changed your hair. It's a matte finish wich i like because it looks natural. It gives you the best texture with a great hold.
I won't change to any brand, i'll stay with BAXTER from now.",1
I believe in this brand - I decided to try this facial wash and so far I have no complaints. I have Rosacea so its very hard to find something my skin won't be irritated with. I've noticed my skin softer.. Will continue to buy.,1
Hated it so much. I was disgusted by this product and used it to deodorant my feet! I would never purchase this product not even for a dollar!,0
"It stopped working in less than 4 months. Unfortunately, I can't find any way to return to Amazon or get warranty information.",0
"Didn't work good for my hair, caused more hair fall. returned it",0
Great smelling. But after about a hour --i did not smell it anymore. Others did. So i guess it did what it was suppose to do... LOVE the perfume..,1
Love it,1
"I searched and searched for the perfect nude CND Vinylux. I loved this color because it's more on the baby pink side of a nude polish. Looks great with my winter and summer skin tones. The quality of this nail polish is great. The only reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is because of how many coats it takes to get an even color. The polish goes on streaky and transparent. It takes 3-4 thick coats before you see an even opaque color. I would be fine with a less opaque color if it didn't apply so streaky. Once you get a smooth handful of coats on the color is unbeatable. Just make sure to allow yourself time to put on enough coats and have time for the polish to dry in between. After applying the weekly top coat, I usually get a solid 5-7 days of chip free manicure. I work with my hands in dish water and being washed frequently. This is the first polish I can go through more than one shift of working without chipping off. The color is beautiful and the time it takes to apply is worth it.",1

"While this product holds your hair well, it contains too much clay for my liking. I literally felt like I had clay in my hair all day and when I would run my hand through my hair during the day, it would come out with a bit of clay on it such that I felt the need to then wash my hands.

On the plus side, this product comes in a nice cool glass can and smells great.",0
"I love the regular mustela products but this fails. It is very grainy and uncomfortable. I believe all the ""mineral"" sunscreens are like this.",0
not worth a price. Just use the product twice & it does not work any more.,0
Doesn't seem like the same quality as when I buy it at my local Spa,0
It is definitely not waterproof at all..a eyeliner by ulta is much better.....will not purchase again..very disappointed,0
It[s powder without an applicator and I think that's a ripoff. Why sell something that you cannot use without buying something else? You don't.,0
Eyeko is an amazing brand for liners!  This dried up in a sec & doesn't smudge or smear at all.  It goes where you draw. Stays for hours from morning till night or when you take it off!,1
"Nice, neutral shade.",1
"I like this. I've mostly gone natural when it come to hair products, but I still use this. It makes my hair shiny and it feels stronger for some reason. It doesn't smell too strong like the serum that CHI makes. Not sure if it's all placebo still but I use this often after two years.",1
"Orange-y staining on fabrics is a negative; otherwise, it goes on smoothly and serves as make-up for me with a bit of cheek color. It's the only sunscreen I have tried that doesn't sting. Time will tell if it is protecting my skin....",1
A little bit stiff for me .But still works .,1
"I didn't realize this was a product for men at first. It's has a nice consistency and fragrance, but overall I haven't noticed much exfoliating effect when using it.",1
Not the real deal. Ugh.,0
"This nail polish holds up for 5-7 days, even for me - which is a big deal since I am not gentle with my nails. Regular nail polish only lasts a few hours before chipping, whereas this stuff lasts at least 5 days! Definitely a great purchase! Also, it comes off with regular acetone polish remover without ruining your nails like Shellac. The color I ordered, however, was a tad more red than I expected from the picture, but I still liked it.",1
"My husband has been using this twice a day, for several weeks.  We see no improvement on his beige teeth.  He doesn't smoke, or drink alochol, yet his teeth are beige.  I was really hoping this toothpaste would work, based on all the reviews.  We're not impressed so far, but he will continue to use it until the tube is gone.",0
I've never liked putting sunscreen on my face and this was the perfect solution.  It doesnt irritate my sensitive skin or cause acne like most sunscreens do.  I don't really find it mattifying though.  My sister liked it a lot for use on top of her makeup when we were vacationing in the sun all day.,1
This is my go to powder when I don't have enough time to do my makeup. It makes me look put together all by its self. It has great coverage and a tint of shimmer which gives an all over glow to my face. I will buy this product forever. I guarantee you will be addicted once you try it too.,1
"I love this hairdryer....my only problem is the control switches, I find them hard to move, but other than that, it's the best hairdryer I've ever owned.  The force of the air that comes out of it is stronger than I expected. It's easy to hold, not heavy. I would recommend it.",1
Love this cleanser. Leaves my face feeling clean and fresh. Never leaves my face dry or irritated. This is my second bottle and glad I found this product on Amazon.,1
"I didn't buy this product from Amazon, but from Target. The description sounded like it would help straighten and style my curly hair, which gets particularly frizzy at any given moment. The Perfecter barely worked at all. The heat setting is incredibly low and after running it through my hair a few times, I couldn't figure out the difference between using the Perfecter and using my hair brush.

This product might work for short and fine hair, but for someone with curls and moderately medium/long hair, the Perfecter didn't do anything at all. I'm going to return it the moment I can.",0
"Great product, I really like it , leaves my hair totally straight. I loved it.",1
It smells really bad. I will not use a second time,0
I thought this would be black eye liner with some speckles of glitter.  But it has a metallic look which I do not like.  Am not buying again.,0
Turns orange and streaks very bad,0
"Sort of disappointed.  I thought paying a little more the straighter would make it work better and stay straight longer, but in my personal experience that was not the case.",0
"Hair dryer works fine, but the handle gets so hot it will literally burn you like a hot iron. I can't believe this isn't mentioned more in the comments. I have burned my hand on it many times, causing me to yell out and drop it on the floor. Works great if your willing to dry your hair while wearing an oven mitt. It seemed to not heat up as fast the first few uses (I do have long thick hair), but now handle is hot enough to burn my hand in just seconds. I have never had a hair dryer that did this, even with all my past cheap drug store purchases. I thought I was upgrading with this purchase, but now drying my hair is a painful ordeal.",0
"I did not get my Perfecter from Amazon, I received it as a gift.  But, I wanted to write a review to give some tips on how to use it.  Number one if you have thin hair, only use it on a few strands at a time.  I tried it on a larger amount and it got stuck in my hair. I lost a lot my hair trying to get it out of the tool.  I have extremely thin hair, so this was devastating to me.  But, I do believe the product works fairly well when you take the right precautions and are careful when you use it.  I'm Caucasian, but my good friend is African American with natural hair and this product worked miracles on her hair.  I think this product probably works best on thick and/or frizzy hair.",1
Felt too loose for my liking and wouldn't recommend it for anyone who has layers...,0
The Japonesque Power Eyelash Curler has the correct shape for my eyes.  I have very short lashes and it's hard to find one that fits. Although it fits the curl will only last for about 10 seconds even though I hold the curler and press hard for about 30 seconds. It's not even worth using.  I have bought several curlers recently and none of them seem to work like the old ones did. I think they use silicone instead of a rubber material and it just does not work for me.,0
This contained a lot of good products,1
"Very pleased with this dryer! It is a nice weight and is quieter than other dryers I've used, yet seems to have a stronger fan. Would definitely recommend!",1
"Great produce, price not.",1
Came quickly as advertised.,1
It doesn't clean my lashes.. I prefer Clinique,0
Didn't do much except tingle.,0
"I really like this item. The color is very natural looking and the fine brush is perfect for making it look like fine hairs. It is taking some practice to get my eyebrows to look the way I want, but as I get better at using this type of brow makeup vs my powder pencil from Lancome... I am really liking it. The color is more natural than the Lancome pencil I've been using, so this is a big plus. It is also waterproof so stays on really good once applied. It is not a 'quick' application by any means - it takes longer to do than brow pencil, but worth the effort.",1
"I bought three of these for my husband and two sons, and they all thought it was terrific, just about the best shave gel they had ever used.  The only criticism came from my husband--he says that it's hard to avoid cuts because the gel is clear, and you can't tell where you've shaved.  (He's used to the foam.)  But my sons loved it, and like the fact that it's transparent.",1
Love it,1
"It's an Ok product. I've been using it for the past 4 days and other than smelling pretty good, and oiling up the beard, it certainly does not make it softer or tamer as it indicates it does.",0
"Instead of just one moisturizer, I received a box of 6 unused tester bottles...wow! Thank you Elta MD! So grateful!!",1
"Not as good as Spa H2o triple body but will be good until some people put more of the older
product on Amazon. Or get smart and produce something better.",1
Seems like a fake!,0
"The dryer seems great but the bonnet is defective, the part where the hose attaches just fell off while I wad using it. I'd recommend a better constructed bonnet.",0
Not the worst brush but not good for the price. I like the wooden barrel but the cork handle is not super smooth. It is (handle) however a nice length and girth. The bristles are mostly nylon save for a few hard-to-see/find boar hairs per tufts. The bristles are long and easily catch hair. My issue is that nylon brushes do not give me silky smooth results. Had I known that the nylon to boar hair ratio is high I would've passed on purchasing in the first place.,0
Used the product for well over a month and it does not do as advertised.  I don't see his spots lightening up even a little bit.  Very expensive product; seen no results.  Would not recommend this product to anyone.,0
This product leaves my hair somewhat soft but i can get it softer with an item from my local supercenter for a way more affordable price. The smell is okay. I was starting to wonder if i got the real product.,0
good,1
It takes very little product to get the volume you want so this may seem like a little bottle but it will last you a while if you use it right.,1
"I got the version that is for thin and soft nails and it is terrible.  The instructions say to apply two coats the first day and then a new coat every other day. But the very next day after applying the first coat, it is already peeling off near my cuticles and chipping off at the tips of my nails...basically coming off all around the edges of my nail. I tried following the instructions, but it just feels really gross to be applying ever thicker coats of polish on top of polish that is already peeling off so I keep removing it and starting over every couple of days, but I think that is worse for my nails than not using anything on them. I considered it a big splurge to spend $17 on nail polish and so I am very disappointed. I wonder if the original formula is better than the soft and thin nails formula since the product got such great reviews. Tried to exchange it but could not so I am stuck with it.",0
Did not do anything. Even had 2 friends try it. Just looks like lip gloss. Very disappointed in this product.,0
I'm a huge fan of Mario Badescu products however for an eye cream is sure does sting & my eyes are by no means sensitive. Wont re-purchase.,0
This spray made my hair tacky and sticky. I had to go out and purchase it from that company direct.,0
the ad stated it was Red Door perfume but it was actually toilette water.,0
"After using drug store blow dryers my entire life I finally decided to purchase a BaByliss based on my hair stylist's high praise. I. LOVE. My. New. Blow dryer. Drying time has been cut by half easily. Truly a case of ""you get what you pay for,""  but for roughly 50 bucks more than what you'd pay for said drug store blow dryers it's a bargain. I've seen high end blow dryers ""on sale"" for $150 or more and can't imagine that they would be better than the BaByliss Pro. Highly recommend.",1
"It's a little time consuming, but it works as stated and I saved a ton of money. It's been almost a month since I completed the treatment, and although my hair isn't as straight as day 1, I still have significantly less frizz after walking around in the Florida humidity.  I had a friend help me use this product (I wouldn't recommend you try this alone). We used about half of both bottles and it took about 2 hours. I used It's a 10 prior to straightening (instead of the protective spray that they mention in the directions). I did slightly burn a small piece of hair in the back but it isn't noticeable and I'm really happy with the results. It I went to the salon they quoted me at $400 for a Keratin treatment and $600 for Japanese straightening. I spent $90 total and now I don't even have to blow-dry my hair.",1
"Love this, definitely necessary for applying the mouse.",1
"I was really expecting better quality from a brand like Stila. It doesn't dry down quickly, and it transfers and bleeds all over the place. It's tremendously messy. I would definitely not retry this liquid lipstick.",0
"This thing worked one time. The next day, I plugged it in, turned it on and NOTHING! No heat. Light was on...just never got hot again. Returned and bought a cheap Conair which works like a charm everytime.",0
Very nice,1
"Not intended for dry skin, could find less expensive cream in the drug store.",0
This item will not work in my country how come you accept selling it,0
Cleared my one month olds baby acne in three days! Amazing product and smells great!,1
The product is more oily than I expected but removes makeup from the brushes better than elf or Mary Kay by far and dries quickly,1
"Not a fan of the oily consistency, plus the smell is not pleasant at all. I like the other VICHY spf, thought will try something new, this one is not for me",0
"While I've only been using this about 2 weeks, I do think that my skin looks good, especially considering we're fast approaching winter here and heaters tend to dry me out. Specifically, I notice that my foundation tends to go on a little more smoothly and my skin feels softer. My t-zone is also noticeably less oily, but I'm not sure if that is a result of this or a different powder I started using. A downside is that this isn't to go near the eyes, which is where most of my fine lines actually are, so this product cannot help that.

As for the application itself, it goes on fairly well, but seems a tiny bit tacky at first; fortunately, it soaks in quickly and becomes unnoticeable. I don't find it so moisturizing that I can skip facial lotion...which considering this doesn't have SPF, I would need to put that on, anyway.

The product itself smells very gingery with a slight trace of citrus, though it dissipates quickly. I find the scent pleasant, and I'm highly sensitive to perfumes, which makes me pretty sure the fragrance here is from essential oils, not chemically produced scents.

The packaging is both awesome and frustrating, and a major reason for the 4-star rating. You take off the lid and it has a large button for the pump on one side and a well where the product shoots up on the other. One push is about the perfect amount for me and I love that there is no waste and no nozzles to clog up...it's a really neat system. My concern is that I'm not sure if I can get the top off once product runs low. I tend to be thrifty and use up ALL of a product before moving on. This one costs a small fortune, so I would want every last drop. The best I can tell, I will probably have to destroy the package to make that happen.

My other (small) issue is the naming; I find ""stem cellular"" a bit misleading. I'm not sure what it means in the context of this product, but I'm pretty sure I'm not smearing plant stem cells on my face and making new skin. Of course, this is an issue with pretty much all beauty/skincare stuff, so it's par for the course. Still, annoying, though.

Still, overall, I've been pleased with this moisturizer and, depending on how long this jar lasts, I will likely repurchase in the future.",1
"I know this product is expensive, but it does last a really long time.  If you apply a small amount on your damp neck, you will be able to make it last for many months.

It is not a miracle, and if you have a super saggy neck, don't expect this product to be the magic bullet you are looking for.  I started using this when I was 47, as part of my regular morning routine.  I think the lightness and silkiness makes it better able to absorb into the skin.  The change was gradual, but definite.

When I really noticed the difference is a couple of months ago when I ran out.  I tried to use regular body lotion to moisturize my neck, and felt it just sitting on top of the skin, rather than sinking in.  I started seeing my old neck again pretty quickly.  Now here I am on Amazon, trying to buy some more.",1
"Not what I thought it would be at all.  I was hoping for something I could spray into wet hair and go, which you can, but it leaves it stiff and crunchy, like a gel.  I was hoping for a product more like Oribe's curl gloss, but cheaper.  This is not it.",0
Worked great for 8 months then suddenly one plate stopped working. Since the product was in warranty period I sent it to Paul Mitchell for replacement. Poor customer service from Paul Mitchell paid more than $20took more than one month for them to tell me that they cannot refund or replace the product since it was purchased from Amazon even though I had told them that I purchased it on amazon first time I called them. The product is great but buy it from licensed distributor.,0
Wasn't very confortable,0
"I bought this and used it for a few months, but it smells terrible. I am not sure what they are thinking about. I will not be buying again.",0
"I did not like this tinted moisturizer. It came without a safety seal (not sure if it should have one) but with all the fake beauty products out there, it was a bit sketchy. It did not sit well on my skin throughout the day and it oxidized on me. Would not recommend.",0
Made my face break out,0
The product was great on my hair and I will buy it again. But it is so thick that it is almost impossible to get out of the bottle.,1
My eyes stung with each use just from the fumes/smell. My hair was static by the end of the first day after washing. Shame.,0
"I have used dark spot correctors before and none of them really erase the dark spots, they just dull them.  This one from La Roche-Posay does dull the darkness but you don't have to look hard to see the spots.  I have very fair skin so any dark spot tends to stand out.  I have tried coverups, another brand of spot corrector and this product and I really don't see any great difference.  This leads me to believe that this is about as good as it gets and the coverups are distinctly less expensive.  I daily moisturize ( I live at 6500 ft) with Argan oil and my skin is supple.  I don't notice any difference in where this product is applied and where it isn't.  Perhaps others with different skin, will have more success.",0
Not as good as the gray/white clay. This seems to leave white residue in my hair unlike the reg clay. Easy to apply and does style.,0
More expensive than gold and about as effective. Poor product. Poor results. Save your money. I found wella intensive tonic to be much more effective.,0
"I use this on my toes....the gel polish (in this color) on my fingers. Looks elegant, receives lots of compliments. I always go back to this color after trying other reds/wines. I have very pale skin and this color does NOT look overwhelming on me. Try it!",1
a hassle to change blades. could cut self if not careful,0
"This color is beautiful; the perfect nude I was looking for. The only problem was that when I opened the package, half of the eyeliner broke off. The packaging seemed cheap but the color and pigment of the eyeliner is nice.",0
Tiny and was very dark gray. My hair is white gray,0
I bought this directly from the manufacturers site and it did absolutely nothing for my hair. Even a hairdresser said it does nothing to me. The Clairol conditioner from the color boxes works better.,0
"Great moisturizer, prescribed by my dermatologist.  It is very light and good for oily skin. Not good enough for the winter and recommended to use heavier lotion overnight.",1
"This can not be OPI Polish. To thin to get any coverage, even after 3 coats. VERY disappointed because I love the color.",0
Love the concealer.,1
Well I tried it the first day and no results with toning stomach so will finish it ! See wat happens but I rated it two stars because it has a very great smell!,0
The perfume itself is nice. But the price is a rip off and the bottle is soooo tiny. Don't let the picture fool you,0
Didn't work at all. 1 Star is being generous.,0
I like the convenience of the microwaveable cup but it's not working as well at the old metal cup. Disappointed.,0
Best foundation I have ever used,1
"Love this color and prefer it to gelish pale pink colors...however, my LED light left it tacky to the touch even though I had my hands under the light for longer than I do for the gelish.",1
"I have used many different crystal nail files, and this is by far the worst. It snapped on the first use, though I wasn't putting any pressure on it at all. I still use one of the shards, and the surface grit has not dulled. I  much prefer the NailTek XL or the Essie crystal file. In any case,  no matter what file you buy, make sure it is a true crystal file as opposed to a glass file with grit adhered to it.",0
"I give this Silk'n Flash & Go Removal Device ONE STAR based on skin complexion people. I was not aware of the device bias functions until after I purchased the product and review the DVD instructions on how to use the device and type skin color the device is best used on for a successful hair removal results. The device it self seems to be a good product for the price I purchase for $176.00, not including taxes and shipping/handling. I purchased this device to remove fine facial hairs from above upper lip.

I used the device to test the sensitivity on the inside of my forearm which is a fair light skin area and it stimulated that area twice but I had to keep moving it around to find a fair lighter spot. I tried it on the upper lip area absolutely NO stimulation and the indicator AMBER LIGHT will let your know that the device sensor could not sense any light skin on the face... TWO THUMBS DOWN!!!!  :(",0
A little too shiny...but it's cool.,1
"When I was offered a chance to review this product on amazon.com, the name looked familiar.  I asked my wife if she would like to try it in exchange for her opinion.

Here is what she had to say:

My husband knows that I like the ""Clean Fragrance"" brand. The company's philosophy is inspired by a simple concept to make the most of every moment and to fill each day with lifes perfect pleasures.

I have allergies and fragrances often cause me to have watery eyes, sneezing and if highly fragrant, I can have wheezing.  A whiff of Estee Lauderes Youth Dew or Yves Saint Laurents Opium can illicit all of the above and more.

When Tom  was offered a chance to review this product, I was happy that he asked me if I was willing  to try the fragrance ""Warm Cotton"" because of my prior delightful experiences with ""Shower Fresh.""

The Warm Cotton Clean Eau de Parfum has a light scent. It reminds me of cotton clothes when they have been dried outside on the clothes line in the sun. At the first spray it is a bit strong but quickly dissipates and you are left with a soft citrus light musk scent that stays with you through the day.""

Enjoy!

I like the light fragrance this product leaves on my wife and recommend it as a Christmas gift or as one for any special occasion in appreciation for the woman you love.",1
Great product.,1
it is an exellent present and the price was very good i recomend it for any men at any age,1
This scent is truly one of my favorites. I have bought 2  bottles from department stores and thought I was getting a deal because of the Price. The scent does last at all. Compared to spraying twice with the department store bottle(and the fragrance lasting all day) you have to spray a number of times in order to smell the Amazon bought one.  The smell of the Amazon bought one also doesn't last long and seems to be watered down.,0
Great product for your hair.,1
"1. Given the expense of this product, you want to use as little as possible for every application. However, the pump on the tube facilitates getting more than you need.

2. It's going to take many weeks if not months to find out if this product has any effect whatever. If this were a cheap eye cream, I'd recommend taking the risk. But given the expense of this product . . .",0
"The scent is subtle and very nice, and it is non-irritating as one would expect from a quality product from L'Occitane. However, it doesn't provide long lasting protection against sweat or odor. The most it lasts is 3-4 hours and this is for office work, not anything physically demanding, so I wouldn't use it for working out or any physical labor. Sad that I have to go back to the traditional aluminum-based products which work and are much less expensive, but can be irritating with long-term use.",0
"The product came all broken.  The cold case was fine, but the bronzer itself was all broken up.  So disappointed.",0
"I trust this brand because I had a nail clipper of this brand for years, the slim style is stylish; the blade is sharp, durable.  Therefore, I also bought one to my brother a year ago.  Recently, I lost mine and just bought one from Amazon a week ago.  During the waiting time, I was so excited to look forward receiving it until I opened the package.  I don't know how to explain my feeling, everything looks odd except the size! Compare with the one I gave to my brother, I am not sure if it is because the origin of made.  I didn't even want to use it at all! Can I return it ? I am not satisfied of its hand-feel.  I would rather using my money on purchasing something else instead.",0
"The first time I heard about stainless steel soap was years ago when it was advertised to outdoorsmen for taking fish odors off of hands after fish cleaning.  Now they are touted for their ability to remove garlic and onion odors off of hands.  So I finally gave it a try.

The soap came with instructions to rub it between your hands like regular soap, under cold running water for 30-40 seconds.  I tried it after cutting up onions, and after smashing garlic. I must say that after my hands warmed up from 30-40 seconds of cold water washing with it, the odor was a little less potent, but by no means eliminated.

Others have had good results, but my experience was less than that. I don't know the premise behind why this should work to remove odors. All I know is it didn't do that much to remove odors from my hands. Perhaps it is a question of body chemistry for efficacy. Two stars for results that were not so good.",0
"Was disappointed to have to return this lipstick, it gave an uncomfortable burning sensation on the lips and I immediately sent it back knowing I could never wear it.  I do have some make-up sensitivities but I never had a burning lipstick before. Maybe it will be different for you. Was worried that it wouldn't be an acceptable return having used it once but Amazon did refund the purchase, so I was very glad of that.",0
I love it! My lips fells so soft and sexy the same time,1
I have long thick wavy hair and this is the best flat iron I've ever used!,1
as expected,1
Super cute and adds a noticeable flattering color to my lips. These are small and will run out quicker than other tinted lip balms. The price is a bit higher from Amazon than other sellers but can be worth it from a convenience standpoint.,1
"Polish didn't do much for my hairstyle.  I can buy similiar products, at a cheaper price at the pharmacy!",0
"My hair looks shine and strenght.  First time I use Sebastian products and they are excellent quality.  It's exactly
the product what was expecting",1
bought as a 2015 Christmas gift for my daughter.  It stopped working 7 months later.  Amazon quickly replaced it with a new one!!!!!!!! Thank you!,0
"I purchased this flat iron for traveling international. I have the larger version that I use everyday but it was not dual voltage so I had to find a new one to travel with. This one didn't really straighten my hair, it made it wavy and a lot more frizzy. The 1/2 could have been too small too. I would not recommend this if you have very curly or long hair. It took me about 15 minutes and still didn't look that great. By the end of the day it was wavy again.",0
"If you look at this product you assume, that like 100's of other products that sense it's stands on the lid, the product is thick enough that it won't spill out.  WRONG!!!  While I like how the cream conditioner works on my hair, it is not worth the hassle of it spilling every where!",0
Love it smells so yummy!,1
This is a great color! The brand is high quality but does chip after about a week if you aren't super careful.,1
"If you're nearly bald this isn't going to work, however if you've got thinning hair this will work wonders. I've been losing my hair for 10 years now, and thankfully it has been a very slow burn. If I didn't have toppik I would have had to have shaved my head years ago, this stuff buys you more time with hair. I use dermmatch on the front of my hair line, and toppik on the rest. This is the method I recommend.",1
Love this stuff - I've found the best price for it here.,1
"I was very interested in trying this unique skincare line and thought that getting this 5 day detox mini sizes kit would be the way to go for first-timers. I started with the Glacial Wash which, along with the Arctic Mist toner, and day moisturizer and night cream is what this kit features. The products are heavy in a minty scent, especially the toner or Arctic spray. After using these products for several days, my face looked and felt very soft and smooth. I am not sure how the company could have believed that using mentholated ingredients in their products was beneficial for the skin, as menthol type ingredients are known skin irritants. However, I have personally not experienced much if any redness upon use of these four products. My face definitely tingles after using these products and it seems to stay clear, though I don't have a problem with stressed skin per se. Overall, these are very unique products and they definitely wake your tired skin up after use. Most of the reviews I have read on other websites give this kit and the Skyn Iceland products a stellar rating! Maybe this company is doing something right, as they do seem to be quite effective in keeping your skin smooth and with that very tingly, alive feeling!",1
"This foundation sets nicely once applied, and goes on thick enough to give you max coverage.  This foundation definitely is not for those who want ""The natural look"".  Sets nicely under bronzer or facial powder.  Use a dot on your lips to make your lipstick last longer and to achieve vibrancy in color.",1
I've used this lash liner for the past two weeks and don't see ANY difference in lash fullness!  Will give it another two weeks and report back...,0
"I just bought this color and tried Infinite Shine for the first time. I am blown away! I had to come and leave a review.

Pros: it's a thick polish that is very easy to manipulate. It's INCREDIBLY shiny- I have been doing my own gel nails at home with a gel light for years and this polish looks the exact same as when I do my nails in gel. It dries fast; I painted my nails with the 3 steps and 30 min later it's totally dry. I also love the color. It looks a lot like You Dont Know Jacques.

Cons: None yet! I will check back in to see if it truly lasts the 7-10 days as advertised.

Update 11/1/15- Sadly, the product does not last that long. I've tried two separate colors and it only lasts about 3 days before it starts to chip. Definitely better than a ""regular"" top coat, not nearly as good as my gel nails at home.",1
NICE,1
"I have tried DOZENS of acne treatment products from Amazon, and this was among the worst. My heart sank as soon as I used this cleanser for the first time, because it BURNED. I tried to hold out hope, reasoning that perhaps it was only because it contained strong medicine (which my acne-ravaged skin BADLY needs) and my skin would adjust. HA! ONE DAY of using this and other Mario Badescu products and my skin was so hideously ravaged it looked like I had a contagious disease. I just don't understand it because the ingredients listed in these products are not ones that usually have an adverse effect on my skin. Oh, and by the way, all of the Mario Badescu products I ordered (via Amazon LLC) came UNSEALED, and were not even in any kind of box/container/wrapper. Considering that several of the products were LIQUIDY, that's crazy. But I will say Amazon gave me a FULL refund, which is indeed very honorable and shows great integrity.",0
"Slides around on my hand when I'm applying the lotion and then seeps through the sides onto my hand. So I still end up with brownish hands, which is what I was trying to avoid when I bought the mitt.",0
"This sounded like a deal too good to be true. I should have known better, but I fell for it. The product I received is not the Detangler by Paul Mitchell. There is an underlying odor, not overpowering, but definitely there. My guess is that some actual product was mixed with whatever this stuff is, in an attempt to pass it off as authentic.",0
"This razor will give you a close, smooth, comfortable shave - but it can cut you if you do not treat it like an open comb razor.

Pros: Close, smooth shave.
Cons: Although not technically an open comb razor, it must be handled with the same caution as an open comb, or it will cut you just like a Fatip Grande or similar razors.",1
My husband says this is the best hair gel every (and he's tried several!).,1
"I used the Lip Renewal (in the pretty, little frosted glass jar) and absolutely loved it !! I've always had dry lips and the Lip Renewal was like a miracle! It went on smoothly and made my lips feel silky soft and hydrated. I would call the consistency of it like a ""balm"".  The ""new version"" (but NOT improved) comes in a tube and is a cream, which has to be rubbed in. The feel is nothing like the former product. It doesn't make my lips feel hydrated at all. I'm extremely disappointed because it used to be my very favorite lip product (and trust me, I've tried everything). I won't waste money on this product anymore. I'm going back to my Blistex ""Lip Medex"" in the navy blue pot.",0
"These products are all very nice, except for the diaper rash cream which didn't seem to do much of anything. The shampoo is very light and rinses away easily, leaving my grandson's hair soft and clean smelling. The cleansing gel is good and doesn't exacerbate his eczema like some baby washes we've tried. The body lotion goes on nicely and is well-absorbed and doesn't leave skin feeling greasy.

I especially like the no-rinse cleansing water. We had him at a picnic in the park where we didn't have access to running water. He spit up all over himself and the cleansing water did a great job of cleaning him up and left him smelling clean.

The only drawback to this product is the packaging, which was not well thought out. The bottles are attached to the bottom of the box with super sticky glue pads that are nearly impossible to remove from the bottles, making the bottles difficult, if not impossible, to stand up.",1
"The first time I used I had an allergic reaction, I wasn't sure if it was from the face wash or something else. I attempted to use again and had the same reaction and am now unable to return the product. Not impressed!",0
Stuff is amazing clears skin up quickly,1
"This is great on my hair, which can become frizzy and dry. I place a very little on my hair after it's dried from washing; it takes all the static and frizz from my hair. I haven't tried it as a facial moisturizer, which I understand it can also be used for.",1
"Nice shade compliments well with my complexion, gives a nice dewy look",1
this product did not work for me. Felt heavy and burned my eyes. I am willing to try new approaches and products but sometimes it just does not work for my sensitive eyes.,0
"I had a T3 Featherweight hair dryer when they were made in USA.  It started having issues after many many years, but they are now made in China so would not re-order one of them.  This one also dries fast, it blows harder (more air flow) than the T3, but is not as hot.  The T3 did tend to scorch my hair a little and I had to use the concentrator to give more distance between the heat and my hair.  With this one, I do not have to use the concentrator and so it is easier to maneuver.  I am liking this one more than the T3 overall and have noticed less frizzy ends and hair color loss even over the T3.",1
Great fragrance but not quite the same as the balm items.  A little thinner but still 4 stars.  I also use the sandalwood balm and that is the best.,1
Very nice shampoo.. A bit expensive ! but worth it,1
"I have heard of this hand cream for a while and always wanted one. I got one from Amazon, and I am not big fan of it. It is a little too thick for my hands which don't get super dry. I think it would be a good product for someone has very dry hands.

Update:
After applying this hand cream for couple days, I fall in love with it now. My hands are so smooth!",1
very poor quality,0
"I'm a little sad about this peel because I think they reduced the strength since I started using it some years ago-- it definitely doesn't work quite as well as it used to, which is good news for some people (it's gentler now, more like the sensitive version was) and bad news for people like me who need to beat the everloving crap out of their skin to get it to behave.

That said, I still love this product and use it all the time. It's mild enough to use on a regular basis but more effective than an AHA cream or gel. I use it to remove dark-spot scars I get after a breakout and it still gets the job done, though since it seems to have gotten milder it does take more uses to get the same effect... For normal people who don't have extremely tough facial skin like me, this is probably a non-issue.

There's no actual peeling or down time, so if you want to dip a toe into the world of chemical peels with low risk, this is a good way to start.",1
"This product didn't do anything for my acne at all. I probably would have been better off just using nothing. While it didn't dry out or irritate my skin, there was no noticeable change to the pimple either. It did work great for my brother, though, who has severe cystic acne.",0
"I love glytones other products, but this one I cant get used to.  I've been trying to ""step up"" for a year.  Just to harsh for the day time.  God forbid if you go outside after using this...even with SPF 50.",0
I am not sure this is a real mario badesco product. When i buy this in sephora it works great. This one makes my skin break out,0
I would not recommend purchasing this product. I used this twice and it stopped working. Pretty pricy for only two usage days.,0
Wonderful must have product! It really cure nails damaged after multiple shellac uses. The smell is nice and application is easy. Just use it regularly!,1
I was surprised that I was actually able to notice the difference.  My skin looks fresher and hasn't broken out since I started using it.,1
Eh. Didn't do much for my wavy/curly hair. The texture made my hair feel limp and greasy,0
"too expensive, didn't work well",0
Makes my beard feel warm and fuzzy before I shave it off.,1
Wonderful but there is no difference between this and any other brand like E.L.F same effect . I keep this one for special occasions  since it's pricey.,1
All products in this line gave a different scent.  I'm allergic to this one BECAUSE of the scent.  Too bad.,0
good product,1
"This didn't work well for me. Made my hair feel knotty, rough and unhealthy. Smelled nice but that as about it. I have thick, colored hair.",0
Best hair gel ever!!,1
"I am extremely pleased with the entire ""Glo Therapeutics collection"" . I have used many different skin products over the last 40 years and have settled on this line as the best for me. I first purchased it at a salon when it was recommended.",1
"This creme smelled like a mixture of honey and old lady and not in a good way. The tiny spoon that helps you scoop the product out is just that -tiny. I don't like the kind of creams that you must dip in due to the risk of bacteria. I don't care how expensive this creme is or what celebrity utilizes it. I enjoyed faces creams from Benefit, Ponds, and others that smelled better. 4 weeks into applying this creme and I didn't see a difference.",0
"The pink color advertised is actually almost clear when you put it on your nails, no matter how many coats you put on. I mixed it with a white polish, which helped, but you shouldn't have to do that. Don't expect a solid color",0
"I have thick voluminous hair, but it is cut into a short bob.  I bought this because i love the 1-3/4"" Babyliss straightener, and based on other reviews, i thought this smaller one would be great for traveling, for making curls, and better for my now shorter hair.  I found it basically ineffective and would take forever to straighten all my hair with it.  Perhaps this is because i bought the 1/2"" plates - this size would be great for a pixie cut only imo.  The other thing that bothered me was there are nice soft finger pads on the handle but they quickly overheat and i couldn't use them.  I wasn't sure if i received a lemon or it was a problem with the product design generally.  It was a very cute straightener but i would never use it.",0
The bottle was empty.,0
Love it!,1
"It smelled old and stale. I used it three times and each time the powder didn't work, but I had gotten pink eye from it because the makeup getting im my eyes.",0
Didn't really work for my hair.,0
Works great!!  Love it!,1
"This is my absolute favorite hair product. I have used all sorts of holding products from gels, to fibers, and creams. None of them have the hold that this stuff does. A small amount goes a LONG way. So even though the price seems a little high, this jar will last you quite a while. I have a short classic men's hairstyle, and I needed something with a strong hold that doesn't make my hair hard or sticky. This stuff is perfect, and it smells great. My new favorite.",1
"I have used the Lanza Color Care shampoo and conditions (red and white bottle) and thought this SMOOTH would be a good option since I have long straight hair that I flat iron.  WRONG.  This shampoo is SO HEAVY.  I rinse and rinse and rinse and then even after I blow dry my hair I feel like I have conditioner and shampoo residue all over my scalp.  I have resorted to putting a TEENY TINY bit in my hair (only on the ends at this point) and I still can't get that ""clean"" feeling afterwards.  It's like it coats my hair with some weird film.  Also, the smell is a bit overwhelming for me, unlike the red and white Color Care bottle I used which smelled light and clean.  Sorry I wasted my money on this.  Went back to my stylist and bought the red and white bottle.",0
"not a whole lot of extra volume, not a great product. I was looking for something with more of a thickener and volume boost. This is not",0
"I like the shimmer, but the scent isn't there!  Shake it well when you apply, but it won't be as nice as the spray.",0
nice cooling lather,1
It was broken,0
I was disappointed in this product after I saw their ingredients.  Nothing but bad chemicals and Formaldehyde!!!  I bought the DeLore Nails organic nail hardener and nail polish dryer.  So much better.  Cannot recommend this product and will not buy again.,0
"I've tried other curling irons, but this remains my favorite.  It works well with thermal protection sprays, without becoming sticky. Also appreciated are the numerous temperature choices for various hair types.",1
I like the cream it's so beautiful,1
"This salt spray has been a nice addition to my hair routine.  Just 4 pumps is enough to give my hair some added texture without weighing down my hair.  And, by the end of the day, my hair still feels great and looks great.  Great product!",1
I love ck I never herd of ck shock till my client at work had it she sprayed it on an I fell in love with it that moment it smells so fresh and it sticks with u,1
"I like the product, but it broke down and stopped working well in only a couple of months.  It keeps wanting to turn itself off. I've tried to return it or send it back for repairs, but the Amazon system won't accept it.",0
"The first time I tried this I was taken aback by how the Eucalyptus and Menthol felt on my face: I thought it was too much, but I know better now. It lathers up a bit watery for the first pass, but by the time I'm done shaving, it's smooth and creamy. Other products leave my face feeling a bit battered, but this does the job and shaving has gone from a mindless daily routine to a time to slow down and enjoy a good shave.",1
"Of all the whitening systems I've used, with few exceptions, I would rank this one near the top if used as directed.  However, the price leave a little to be desired.",1
Use this and you won't go back to cheap store scrubs.  Maybe pricey but well worth it.  Great to use prior to shaving.,1
"The best recipe for a wake up shower I have found. It's invigorating!
I give these as gifts.",1
"Which the recipient asked for on a gift list. Didn't hear any complaints, but don't know if they bought more either.",1
my hair is unmanageable and very straight and fine so having problems with anything I try,1
GREAT,1
"I currently use make up remover wipes and was excited when I saw this product. I was skeptical it actually removed make up but I read the reviews and figured Id give it a try. The product is just a polyester cloth. The directions say to drench the cloth and it will remove your make up. It DOES NOT WORK. Yes, after lots of rubbing my eye makeup started to come off, but that would happen with any wash cloth. Do not waste your money. If I hadnt already used the product I would return it.",0
No smell,0
light weight and definitely reduces frizz!!,1
"I have read some pretty good reviews for other brands and thought that it would be very easy to use. I was very wrong. I don't like the fact that I cant curl the end because my fingers would get burnt-even with the glove on. It also took a very long time to do all of my hair. I have shoulder length hair, kind of thick. I am just going to go back to using my regular curling iron. What a waste of money.",0
"I am a travel agent and love Elemis products.  This grouping is the best all around of bath, spa, hair, and facial.  Thanks for the savings, ease for travel and stocking me up!",1
No.,0
I enjoyed this curling iron very much!,1
I love the camouflage product and use it frequently combined with other glo products. However I did not receive what was ordered this past time & I ordered two camouflages which aren't exactly cheap & cant be returned. Disappointed in the fact that what I ordered is not what was received or even a product that I use.,0
"Strange taste- concerned if this is OK. I kept thinking I accidentally put it near my lips, so I made a conscious effort one time to apply it only to my cheeks far from my mouth and then I washed my hands completely so that there was no chance it came near my mouth. But sure enough, I tasted a strange taste in my mouth soon after. What is going on here? Is this stuff seeping through my cheeks into my mouth? Should I be concerned about toxicity? This has never happened with any other sunscreen before!",0
"I love this stuff but let me explain the missing star: I have very dry (like flake in the winter, eww I know) eyelids & I was looking for an eye cream to work on both eyelid & under eye. This is said it could be used on both! So excited! Plus it was on sale for $40! Well, it has worked freaking miracles on my dry, creasey lids but doesn't do much firming under the eye. Thus the 4 star rating. If I see it on sale again I'll defintely but again for my lids.",1
excellent product,1
Smells great...i wish it was a bit more like nectarines but it's good...the lotion is thick great for my very dry skin...,1
"EDIT:::
I can't decide whether to give it a one star or two. After using it for awhile now, I realized that it's possible either this one is fake or I don't know what is going on. after shaking it, I apply it on my face and it starts to peel. little rolled up balls of the sunscreen is left on my face and it's super annoying because it gets in my hair and in the busy morning, who wants to sit there and pick that all out? I now only use this during the weekend before I go on a hike where even if I look ""dirty"" with the white spots, it won't matter as much. Definitely won't be purchasing this again.

______________________________________

I tried this at Target and fell in love! I have super super oily skin and needed to find something that dries somewhat matte but doesn't dry my skin out. This is definitely a pricier choice, but worth it! You don't need much to cover your face!",0
"I purchased this from Ulta. I enjoy a couple of MB other things, so gave this a try. I have sensitive, combination oily, acne prone skin.
I used this item maybe 6 times during a 3 week period. I followed the directions closely, and used it on a few acne spots on my face. Out of the few, only one whitehead disappeared within a few days. I don't know if it's because of this item, or the fact that I for once didn't pick at my skin and left it alone, or that I used a Clarisonic brush on my face daily. But since the other acne spots didn't disappear either, I contribute it to the fact that I didn't mess with my face and tried very hard to keep my face clean and moisturized.
I think this stuff is overpriced for the value. I have better results using drug store brands, changing pillow cases and towels every other day, and keeping my hands off my face.
I returned it.",0
Will buy more later,1
"This acne spot treatment is easy to apply to just the affected areas. It is a gel and rubs into the spot nicely. A little bit of this product goes a long way. It doesn't irritate my skin, nor does it leave it dry. The directions suggest applying to the area up to three times daily. I was worried about it drying my skin and only did it twice each day. It didn't make spots disappear overnight, but I think it does make them go away more quickly than if they were left to heal on their own.",1
Strong scent.  Works great on hair.  Package leaks everywhere,0
"I have fair skin with somewhat blotchy, uneven skin tone and I use this in ""light.""  It looks slightly gray coming out of the tube but does wonders to even out my skin tone, takes some of the redness away, and unlike matte foundation, gives my skin a natural glow/glimmer.  After I put it on, it does not look like I'm wearing any makeup, it only looks like I have much better skin than I actually do.  I love it.",1
What is this crap? Everything about the product has changed and NOT in a good way. Ive been using the former product line since 2008. The name changed... eh whatever. Now the formula? The new scent is awful and its in TARGET?! Im not paying this much for a non spa product that has completely changed. So disappointing Ill be canceling my subscription after 10 years a loyal customer.,0
I have tried many this is the best ! Great for sensitive eyes,1
"Really unimpressive. Expensive, but would dry out and cause rashes due to friction. Would never buy again.",0
I love how fast this dries your hair but this is the second one Ive had for less than a year that has broken. The heating element goes out,0
It's a miracle in a wipe! Stops sewating immediately! The only down side is that it leaves a white flaky film in the area of use. I guess you can't have everything! Excellent for those that suffer from hyperhydrosis.,1
No thanks.,0
"I really like the Shampoo, but a good amount was leaked in the packaging.",1
Has helped me with my skin... won't buy any other products.,1
"This is my first Babyliss product but not my first hair dryer. Here's my detailed review on it.

The power (2000 watts) is excellent. I jumped from an 1800 watt hair dryer to this and instantly saw the difference in less drying time (cut in half or more!). The ceramic end of the dryer leaves my hair smooth. My previous dryer was ceramic too however maybe cause this one is new it leaves it a tad bit more smoother.

Functionality:
Most of the features on this BAB2000 live up to name and price except for ONE thing - the speed and temperatures switches are not user friendly. They go up/down instead of to the side which is inconvenient when you want to switch while using the dryer. However what makes is bad (and the reason why I gave it a 4 star instead of 5) is that it's a SLIDE button Switch without any grip or handle on it. I either have to use my nail and or use my other hand to switch the speed, temperature or simply turn ON/OFF.
Imagine you just used a product on your hair (oil mist, heat tamer, etc) and your hands have that slick feel to it, which most of the time this is how it goes, and you are ready to dry your hair but you cannot switch the button to turn on because your finger is smooth and the button has not grip to control with one finger on one hand.
Yeah that's me with this and it's a pain to have to bring down your hand just so that you can use your OTHER hand and turn on the button then lift your OTHER arm again to dry your hair. Imagine doing that for every SPEED CHANGE, TEMPERATURE CHANGE, and TURNING ON/OFF. This part was a disappointment.

Overall:
The dryer itself does not feel light or heavy but at an adequate weight to hold in one hand. It's very sleek looking with the rubberish look however a drawback on the rubberish skin is that you leave prints if you use hair product before or during use of the dryer (i.e. oil mist, heat tamer, etc.).
Performance = excellent
ease of use = poor (due to the switches

I was going to return it however I am still searching for another same brand different model that has the same power (2000 watts) and with easier functionality buttons. So I decided to keep it and deal with it since it's a very strong and great quality product. Hope this helps. I know I read many reviews before I purchase anything and research in other internet places and no one mentioned what I experienced.",1
Does not fit the BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer!  How stupid that it doesn't fit the same brand hairdryer!  It is exactly the same diameter as the hairdryer opening.,0
Much better than previous purchases! This time the quality is much better! Thicker and more  dense than before! Thank you!!,1
My face looks extremely greasy when i wear this. Not a fan.,0
"This product does not remove makeup, dirt, or any other impurities!!! I've used it with a sponge and a facial brush and a film is still left behind. After I wash my face, I use a toner. The cotton pad is always covered in grime after I use this cleanser. As for the exfoliation, it is nonexistent. The only thing I like about this product is the scent.",0
Love this color. It's a beautiful neutral.,1
"Hard to squeeze bottle, watch out if you have carpal tunnel.",1
This product was part of a sample box I received and I had to buy the full product. It is the only cream that has helped my skin condition. I definitely recommend to try smaller size before buying this one since everyone is different.,1
This made my face breakout and i don't have a bad skin problem.  I just needed to hydrate my skin.  I won't buy it again.,0
"I love how it smells, and how it feels on my lips. Not sure if it does it's work with the SPF, though. Haven't really noticed any difference.",1
I am trying to find a replacement to Vivite face wash with 12% Glycolic Acid.  This is thick like dish soap and smells like baby lotion.,0
Great quality!  The cord is a nice length.,1
Not a good product. Tried to like it but it's just not a good product. The worst part about this hair dryer is that the attachments don't even stay on long enough for you to try and use them.,0
"I buy this product frequently and really like it but the last bottle I got did not come out
as foam but as runny goo.  I was so disappointed.

I will continue to buy, but if I get another bottle like this I will send it back for sure!",0
"I suppose I was expecting this to smell like roses, not your run-of-the-mill hair grease. It left my hair feeling more greasy than moisturized.  I couldn't bear to use it.",0
PERFRECT,1
"This is a lightweight clear oil/serum.  My wife has been using it on her d&eacute;colletage to try and erase some of the sun damage done in her earlier years.  She has been using it daily for about a month and has not noticed any real improvement.  At first she was using it on her face too, but got worried that the oily consistency would make her acne prone skin break out and switched to the C complex for her face instead.  The product claims there may be a slight tingling sensation when applied, but that continued use would remedy this, however she did not experience any at all.  The bottle will last for several months as you only need to apply 5-7 several drops to your face, neck and d&eacute;colletage. For the price I would hope that it would work.  Perhaps it only works on mild sun damage and aging skin?",0
This fragrance is not for me.  It gives me a headache after wearing it for a few hours.  I would not buy this again.,0
"Over the years I've experimented with several different brands of mascara, and so far my favorite cheap brand is Full 'N' Soft by Maybelline and my favorite department store brand is Clarins.

This is the first time I've had the opportunity to try out a Julep product; I'd seen the name come up in my friends' makeup subscriptions boxes, but didn't really know much about the brand. Mascara is one of those every-day products for me (I think I currently rotate between three or four different brands, depending on my mood), but because I am sensitive and do get irritated easily, finding the safest brands to use can be a challenge.

Day One

The first day I tried Julep, I kind of felt like I had spider legs for eyelashes. The product clumped on me and it also took a minute to dry, so when I inevitably sneezed or blinked, I had to do some cleanup on my brows (I have long lashes) as well as under my lower lash line. This was a bit discouraging, but I also realized I hadn't combed out my lashes. I put a lash comb on my to-buy list to see if that would make a difference.

Day Two

I decided to do a side-by-side comparison with another mascara brand, called Gabriel (they are a vegan makeup brand). I chose this one to compare it to because I'd noticed Gabriel was good at separating my lashes, but not really adding volume or length. I applied Gabriel on my left eye, Julep on right, studied them for myself, and then asked my husband his thoughts. Right away he noticed that my right eye seemed more clumped than the left.

Day Three

I used Julep on both eyes, and with this test I had a spoolie so I could separate my lashes before applying the mascara. This time I liked the results quite a bit better. My lashes do look longer than normal, but I found myself wishing that they looked fuller and thicker as well.

Overall Impression

Julep is pretty decent, though I'm not sure I agree with its price tag. I even got the chance to test out my sensitivity with the product when I started crying. My eyes didn't become irritated or burn, as they have with other high-end mascaras that I've used in the past. Another positive point with Julep is that the mascara doesn't flake off and I haven't found myself wanting to apply another layer halfway through my day. If this also added volume to my lashes, I might consider making this my go-to mascara. But even after using a spoolie, I still noticed minimal clumping. If thicker, fuller lashes is not a concern for you, then Julep might be a good option for you, if you're okay with minor clumping.",1
Absolutely terrible.  Been using it for 2 weeks amd my hair looks/feels horrible.  Has to be a fake.  Either that or a terrible product.,0
husband says he like it,1
Another great product from Proraso.... the smell is great and I can't find anything bad to say about this soap and I will buy again when I run out,1
I have been using eyelash curlers bought from pharmacies for 15 years.  My recent one broke after a while and I decided to get one with a good review on Amazon.  This one does not curl my lashes at all.  It is as if I haven't used an eyelash curler at all.  I tried using it before and after mascara application and it didn't make a difference.  My other ones always worked well.,0
"I use this with my bridal makeup clients. Every time I use it, they comment on how refreshing this spray feels and how wonderful it smells. I love how to reduces any powdery finish my clients may have after I set their makeup. It's also great when incorporating into your skincare routine.",1
Recommended by manicurists.  But also was told by other manicurists that Vaseline petroleum jelly is just as good as a condition/softener for cuticles and it's cheaper.,1
"First time buying a grease pomade, and it holds my hair great and keeps it in place the whole time on a night out. The only thing i don't like is you have to apply it fast or it'll get stiff and too hard to spread but just run the comb under some water and it fixes that, other than that it's a great product and i'll order again soon!",1
"This contains benzyl benzoate. All benzoates damage DNA and cause cancer.
And when you spray you breathing it in!. Google sodium benzoate and look at the studies.
Type in benzoates dangers.  And its true for all benzoates.
These dummies need to remove this ingredient.",0
"I only used this product two times and stopped!!!
It does make the skin smooth and I did notice a change in my skin right away and my leg bumps got smaller.
BUT
There is two big problems with it :
1. After using the body wash I applied the lotion that comes with it and for 30 min my skin was BURNING like crazyyyy  and I have to even wash of the lotion the second time I used it cause I was about to start crying(no I am not spoiled and I have high tolerance for pain ). I don't want to torture my self  just  to have nice looking legs???? hell no!!!
2. I live in Texas, after the first time using this product on my arms I applied sunscreen and was walking with short sleeves . I always used an umbrella that has a reflection coating ,just to not get too much rays and that day with 5 min walking while having sunscreen on my skin AND using my umbrella,my skin burned!!! so I only could use this product while covering my whole body!! What's the point of having smooth and nice skin when I have to cover it all???",0
"I liked this a lot at first, but then I started to get some bad cystic acne, so I looked at the ingredients and it has butyl end glycol, which can be a culprit in that. I gave it 4 stars because I think I'll still use it occasionally, just not daily.",1
"This was recommended by my esthetician. I have been using for 3 weeks now. I fell my skin more even toned, tight, better complexion. I am happy with the aparece of my skim.
But my skin is more sensitive, almost like it is sore. When I apply it ( once a day) it burns a little bit I will keep the treatment. Happy with it overall.",1
"I read a lot of reviews before selecting this item. The Art of Shaving Cream Sandalwood sounded like a good idea so I was willing to shell out $22.00 for it.  I just do not agree with the people that raved about this product.  The packaging is nice, the fragrance and texture appealing. But once you apply it to your face it feels like a combination of hand lotion and whipped cream. It doesn't spread too evenly either. Once I started shaving, the cream drips off the razor in little globs so make sure you're leaning over the sink or you'll have a mess.
Frankly, I find Edge gel far more useable and pleasant and just as effective - especially for $3.49 a can!",0
I love the smell of this product... but it caused my babies eczema to flair up and his skin to turn bright red and crack. The scent is quite heavy.. back to unscented products go,0
it didn't cover my under eye circles,0
"Hyped products so rarely seem to live up to their claims for me, and purchases I've made in the past based on beauty-blog raves (Clarisonic, I'm looking at you) have generally disappointed me, or just been so-so. This is one thing I'd actually buy again. The smell is really mild and not overwhelming, and it's the perfect weight for my hair (right in the middle of fine and thick, but a lot of it). I have long hair (past my shoulder blades) and was a little worried this wouldn't last very long, but it took me about two months to get through it, which I think is reasonable for the price (I was using it once or twice a week as a masque and every other day or so in the shower as general conditioner). I probably wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again for regular use, but if I had a special event coming up I'd probably repurchase.",1
"Unless you got this for free, this box was a big rip off. The samples are very small. I was very surprised Amazon would offer a box that wasn't a deal, like the Target Boxes. I most likely will not buy a Amazon box like this in the future.",0
"Love it. Covers well light, don't really even need foundation. Highly recommend.",1
"LOVE the smell. Wick is not the best - prone to flowering. Also, the wick runs out before the candle does, leaving 1/2"" or more of un-usable candle, which is a big waste considering how expensive these candles are.",1
I use Yves Saint Laurent Touche clat and I thought this would work as well since the reviews were so good. It has not worked for me at all. It leaves little solid dots here and there and I can't blend them in. A complete waste of money!,0
My favorite shampoo. The only one I use .,1
"I didn't care for this product at all.  This wrap foam seemed like water.  It was suggested to me by a stylist, but I'll stick with my B&B Wrap Foam.",0
"I am confused by this product. I saw this searching for an effective treatment for severe acne, and chose it because of all of the positive reviews. First of all, it's called lotion and it's more like liquid.. so I was thrown off by the consistency when I got it. Second, I had high hopes about it's effectiveness because of all of the good reviews, but after using it for a month I have seen no difference in my acne at all. The only positive is that it hasn't dried my skin out like many other acne solutions I have tried. Actually, it has made no difference at all to my skin, positive or negative..
I'm glad I gave this a try, but I definitely won't be buying it again.",0
don't like it,0
Love this product Used to get it through my plastic surgeon's office until they switched brands when this became available online. Works well and for me most importantly is not greasy at all. Use it for 6 weeks and you will notice a positive difference in skin quality.,1
Ew,0
I received mine and its was broken.. the plastic casing was damaged. I used black duct tape to keep the housing together instead of going through the hassle of sending it back.,1
"Smells great but you can get a huge bottle of this on ebay from multiple sellers for a fraction of the price. Buyer beware: This is a very tiny travel size bottle for $100.  30ml.
You can get a 90 ml bottle on ebay for $90

I feel ripped off but it is my fault for not reading the fine print. Don't buy from this expensive seller.",0
Perfect!,1
Work great,1
"I am a fan of the Moroccan Oil line but this mousse did not meet previously purchased product standards.

Left my hair dry and dull, no fullness or volume.  Did not do a good job of separating and holding curls and waves.  Left my hair a frizzball.

Do not recommend.",0
"It's super moisturizing for my dry skin. It feels slightly sticky, but feels like it tightens my skin. I am very pleased with it!",1
This item does NOT work.  It is terrible.,0
I live the smell of this spray and it is super moisturizing. It absorbs quickly and eaves my akin feeling soft and touchable,1
Love it,1
"I would jot reccomend this curling iron,  While it gets hot, it does not have a burn proof tip, so you have to wear gloves to use it....really bad design",0
Not waterproof at all.,0
"nothing to say, product arrived promptly and was exactly what I expected.  I loveCrabtree and Evelyn Gardeners hand recovery cream",1
"Like any other manufacturer, Ahava produces some outstanding products and some average products.  The sea salt line is exceptional.  The shower gel & liquid salt are great body products.  Because these products worked so well, I decided to buy the line of facial products.  However, claims regarding the quality of the facial product line by the manufacturer are unsubstantiated. To ensure that the Ahava facial products worked properly, I purchased the entire line of facial care products:  toner, mineral beauty serum, smoothing moisturizer, mineral skin osmoter, and so forth.  A couple of hundred dollars later, I saw absolutely no improvement in the texture or moisture level of my dry skin. In fact the smoothing moisturizer and mineral skin osmoter are very thick and have the texture of cold cream. I do not care for these thick substances on my face.  They feel heavy. Do not be mislead by the manufacturer.  These products work no better than the drug store brands. Stick with the body products where you can be happy with the results & justify the price.

FYI:  I read a similar review by another customer.",0
not great,0
"Chose the color based on the Dermablend website, but it was lighter than expected and the coverage is also very light.  This formula is no where near the old Dermablend formula, unfortunately.  Will definitely not buy again.",0
"I really like Butter
London products and this did not disappoint.  It soaks in quickly and has a very nice scent.  My skin feels softer instantly and it helps heal cracked skin on my elbows, with lasting results.  Will definitely purchase again and probably give as gifts at Christmas.",1
Love it!! Dries my thick wavy hair in no time!,1
Great price!,1
I did not buy this product from Amazon. Bought from a local beauty store. Spent the day at my sons baseball game and it all sweated off on my clothes. Works great as long as you don't sweat. I had already noticed it doesnt stay on as well as other tanners Ive used. Not worth the price in my opinion. Going to have to soak my clothes in Clorox 2 now.,0
"I ordered two shadows, but each one the crayon fell out of its ""case."" I tired to super glue it back in, but it just would not stay. This is my first waterproof eyeshadow, so I am not sure if its qualities are similar to others but anyway... the product was easy to apply, but the second it touches skin, it sets in. There's no avenue for blending. I thought the product was irritating because its waterproof quality made it feel as if there was a film, and I could feel every movement of my eyelid, because the shadow ""resisted"" movement.",0
This is not working as it advertised:it makes hair very and there is no changes so I can say is not working Im a 2 weeks using it but I don't see no changes.,0
"This product is not the real thing, buyers be aware.",0
as expected nice,1
good,1
"This is a lovely, delicate fragrance.  Many floral perfumes I find to be a bit sweet, but this has a nice soft balance.  It is called ""sheer"" and it really is.  If you like a bold fragrance or want a sexy nightime fragrance, this is not it.  This is a very soft sort of clean smell when you just want the slightest hint of fragrance.  I even like to wear it to bed for something not overpowering but just a nice smell to sleep with",1
"I have the kind of hair that looks like a disaster area in the mornings, and requires brushing and fussing to look like anything. This pomade was a bit stiff for my purposes, but had great hold without having the brittleness that I've found with some other products. I used it for nights out and parties; it gave that sort of look to my locks that wasn't everyday.

This stuff is a lot more touchable than other pomades I've used, but still not quite ideal, so I'm cutting a star. Still, I strongly recommend this.",1
Horrible! When the bronzer arrived it was a loose powder that went everywhere when opened.,0
I love this shampoo. I have very thick curly brunette hair. I am slowly turning gray. This shampoo is perfect for softness. The gray is highlighted just enough.,1
Bought Queen Vic expecting it to be in bright orange but it turns out to be dark purple instead. Should double check the color before buying.,0
LOVE this product!! Smells amazing and holds well.,1
Used at least 5 times this past week according to directions and I cant tell a difference. And this is coming from a pale ginger.,0
"It's okay. Doesn't smooth my hair as my flat iron does, so I am a bit disappointed.",0
"so refreshing on my skin, love this product",1
"This is my HG lip balm, for the following reasons. *It moisturizes & creates something of a barrier, so I can use it under some drying lip products (like cheaper matte lipsticks) and save my lips some discomfort.
* It's clear, so it can go over a lot of lip color as well, adding gloss and moisturizing
*It is seriously moisturizing and hydrating. The consistency is similar to Vaseline, but the formula isn't. The number 1 ingredient is beeswax (so no bueno if you're vegan), #2 ingredient is shea butter, #3 is an emollient, #4 is green tea leaf extract, #5 & #6 are silicone-based emollients, #7 is ""Flavor,"" #8 is lanolin, etc etc. The formula is designed to be moisturizing.
* It's relatively inexpensive, and long lasting.",1
"After reading MANY reviews and researching various products, I was hoping this was the one for me.  The first day I used it I broke out with a rash all over my face.  I was hopeful it wasn't the product but something else that cause my break out so after waiting almost two weeks for my face to get back to normal, I tried it again.  Although I did not break out, it makes my face extremly dry.  I kept hoping that would change but finally decided it's just ot for me.  Realized today I am 7 days too late to request a return/refund.  Now stuck with $86 for a product that caused so many problems.",0
This does not work like it did in the salon. Possibly old.,0
"I was excited to try this product, but sadly, was disappointed. The formula itself is very nice; a light lotion that glides on without a sticky feel. It has a merest trace of fragrance. I don't have sensitive skin on my face, but I always do a patch test elsewhere first, just in case. I applied this serum to the back of my hands, and immediately felt a burning sensation. I thought it might subside, but it continued to burn and burn until I washed it off. This is a no from me.",0
Felt it was a little drying for my skin not enough moisturizer in it. Especailly for the money.  Thank you.,1
Beautiful vibrant color.  Love the Opi brand.n,1
"I never write reviews, but this product is amazing and it lasts a good while. I needed to take one star away because the mailing was was not good. For the cost of this item, the packaging should not come broken.",1
"Definitely not the 'real' fragrance.  What i received didn't smell the same, or as strong, as when i purchase it in the stores.  Looks like I got sent a fake.",0
"While the color is fine it contains too much sparkle/shimmer, sort of an iridescent sheen.  Not good for my older skin, but the color is a nice ""flush"".  Too bad about the shimmer.",0
Tip didn't glide so well,0
"Haven't noticed a difference in skin or fine lines. Do not like the smell. Skin feels slimy when washing face, even hours after use.",0
It is ok. I used it all up already.  The way it is bottled leaves all of the lotion inside unable to extract or pump.,0
"I used to only use OPI nail polish, but now I only use Butter Londan.  It always goes on smooth and quickly dries. The colors are great and never chips. I also like the base and top coats. They really durable. The Butter polish remover wipes are not only convenient but never messy. You never have to worry about spills.",1
"As soon I started to apply a thin layer on my cleansed skin it started to sting and burn, and I do not have sensitive skin. From Bobbi Brown to Olay and Garnier, anything works. It's basically titanium! Normal problem free too. I washed it off after 2 mins and on my tanned Indian skin it left a grey cast which needed more rubbing and another cleanse to take off.  Frankly I am now afraid of this little jar of Bees (because it stings). I will try it again this time on non cleansed skin ie in the morning face that's just washed with water.",0
Doesn't work good for me,0
This has been my face wash for the last 3 years. I won't change it. Nothing makes my skin cleaner or brighter. It cleans pores deep down to remove the pollution and grime of New York City from your face. Your face will glow. Two soapy thumbs up.,1
Good,1
Color received was not like actual product at all.,0
"While I've only been using this about 2 weeks, I do think that my skin looks good, especially considering we're fast approaching winter here and heaters tend to dry me out. Specifically, I notice that my foundation tends to go on a little more smoothly and my skin feels softer. My t-zone is also noticeably less oily, but I'm not sure if that is a result of this or a different powder I started using. A downside is that this isn't to go near the eyes, which is where most of my fine lines actually are, so this product cannot help that.

As for the application itself, it goes on fairly well, but seems a tiny bit tacky at first; fortunately, it soaks in quickly and becomes unnoticeable. I don't find it so moisturizing that I can skip facial lotion...which considering this doesn't have SPF, I would need to put that on, anyway.

The product itself smells very gingery with a slight trace of citrus, though it dissipates quickly. I find the scent pleasant, and I'm highly sensitive to perfumes, which makes me pretty sure the fragrance here is from essential oils, not chemically produced scents.

The packaging is both awesome and frustrating, and a major reason for the 4-star rating. You take off the lid and it has a large button for the pump on one side and a well where the product shoots up on the other. One push is about the perfect amount for me and I love that there is no waste and no nozzles to clog up...it's a really neat system. My concern is that I'm not sure if I can get the top off once product runs low. I tend to be thrifty and use up ALL of a product before moving on. This one costs a small fortune, so I would want every last drop. The best I can tell, I will probably have to destroy the package to make that happen.

My other (small) issue is the naming; I find ""stem cellular"" a bit misleading. I'm not sure what it means in the context of this product, but I'm pretty sure I'm not smearing plant stem cells on my face and making new skin. Of course, this is an issue with pretty much all beauty/skincare stuff, so it's par for the course. Still, annoying, though.

Still, overall, I've been pleased with this moisturizer and, depending on how long this jar lasts, I will likely repurchase in the future.",1
"I like all the products I have ordered from Mario Badescu. This hand cream is very creamy and it takes only a small amount. I would recommend
this product.",1
Tantowels work better than this version,0
Just okay,0
"My expectations for any skin care product labeled as anti-aging are pretty modest.  I don't think there are any miracles in a jar out there, no matter how elaborate the ingredient list or how high the price tag.  With that in mind, I do like this eye cream very much.

While this product has a gel-like consistency its quite rich and moisturizing.  I gently tap just a tiny amount around my eyes and it absorbs right in.  Its not sticky or greasy and is compatible with my eye make-up.  It has a slight fragrance which is hard to describeits almost a little spicy smelling (I don't find it unpleasant).  I do not experience any burning, redness or stinging when I use this product.

Sodoes it make me look younger?  Hah  Im afraid not, but it does keep the skin around my eyes moist and supple looking and seems to reduce that morning puffiness.  I really like the pump style container, which makes it easy to dispense the right amount of product.  In the $30 price range (for 0.5 ounces) this is at the higher end for drugstore type products but rather modestly priced in comparison to the swankier brands.",1
"Smells pretty good, does seem to give fullness to my thinner hair. I've tried many volumizing shampoos over the years and with this it actually seems like my hair feels thicker even as I'm rinsing shampoo out.",1
"This is a great face cleanser and makeup remover though I would suggest using something specifically made for eye makeup if you use any water proof formulas or a lot of product.  I love Vichy products and this cleanser does a really great job on the rest of my face, but I find that I need to scrub at my eyes to get them clean with this product - which is exactly what you shouldn't do - especially ladies of a certain age.  There is a lot here to love.  It's make of high quality fresh and natural materials by a company that is committed to providing high level experiences.  Not a single Vichy product I have used has ever caused a negative reaction or irritation on my sensitive skin and this product actually serves to sooth and cool my skin.  Very nice.",1
"I had to return it. Had a weird smell coming from it. Did try to use it a couple of times. The air flow is pretty legit, but it doesn't get as hot. I have curly, thick hair, so I need the flow but I need the heat a lot too. I've used other Babyliss hair dryers and haven't had an issue. This just wasn't for me.",0
nice,1
I loved,1
Awesome smell.  My husband really likes this smell.,1
I barely received this yesterday had one ugly break out. and today it almost gone! I was a little disappointed I read someone received other samples of their other products. I unfortunately didn't.,1
The color is very pretty. When the color is curing tho it looks splotchy and messy. At first I thought it was the lamp so I went an got another one and the same thing happened. So I tried a different color of cnd and that one did fine. Very disappointed.,0
"I have used this twice a day around my lips and lines.  There is no visable difference.  Definitly disappointed
Way over priced
well I have finished this product.  This is so crazy that I ever considered paying this amount for the tiny jar.
How can companys advertise a product and make promises and why on earth did I purchase this.  Hopeful I guess.",0
Works fine but not worth the extra money. Nowhere close to the number of pulses. The standard cartridge actually lasted longer than this more expensive one!,0
"What can I say, just a really great shaving cream with a wonderful smell.  Use with shave brush and Gillette proglide for a perfect shave every time.",1
"I got red bumps for the first time after I had my kids and its bothered me ever since. I have used this a few times. Finally bit the bullet and bought the two tubes, even though it is expensive, because it actually works for me. My arms are not perfect, but there is a definite marked improvement. Its worth it to me, especially when I wear sleeveless. I am sure it is not going to work well with everyone's body chemistry, but its worth a try at least once. I noticed a difference within the firt week or so.",1
It was a little lighter than I thought but it is a great product. I use it I just modify with a tad bit of contouring,1
"Easy to apply.  Lasts for over a week when used with CND Vinylux topcoat.  Color is similar to OPI bubble bath.  Nice, professional pale pink.",1
Removes tint or color every shampoo. But the bottle says specifically for color treated hair.,0
Smell totally different than the one that I purchased at my dermatologist. I am afraid to use this product as I doubt that is legit,0
This is a great cream but why the price jump? I ordered it last October for $18 and now it's $42.... what the heck? It's the same size so what gives?,1
I had ordered two tips - one didn't work with my microdermabrasion system and the other tip was defective.  It had no diamond tip pad on it.,0
Another great shampoo that helped keep my silver to white hair from tuning yellow.,1
"At a recent visit to my dermatologist, i saw a brochure and decided to purchase Nectifirm by a company called Revision Skincare. I paid $60 and followed the instructions to apply in an upward movement morning and evening. I have seen no difference in the appearance of my neck. In fact, prior to using this expensive concoction, I found that just applying my facial moisturizer to my neck area gave immediate results of smooth skin and less visibility of lines in the neck area. I would not recommend this product. And I really cannot fathom how Revision's website got before and after pictures....my neck and under my chin certainly had no change. Don't waste your money!",0
One of my favorite perfumes and the fact that it is unisex is awesome. I'm gifting this for my nephew.,1
Heavy but a little goes a long way.  Color runs on the darker side.  I wanted to update the review.  My mistake for not ordering the lightest shade.  But this shade will work well in the summer months.,1
"I have only been using this for a week, but it has been amazing for the tiny little lines I am starting to get under my eyes. I am 37 and this has been a miracle for me! I use a tiny bit and it goes a long way, I bet the bottle will last a long time. I also use the all over face lotion and love it, too.",1
"Provides long lasting moisture. When you first put it on, you'll notice a cool sensation that fades in a few seconds. I find it very refreshing.",1
"Smells great! And the packaging is ideal but it's not the best thing I've used. At least for me, not worth it and would not consider buying again.",0
"Wouldn't buy it again. When I bought it, it was already dried out. Had to throw it away. I've bought the real thing from Sephora and loved it, but this isn't it.",0
"Got this for my daughter who gets greasy hair in the front.  Works well, but is REALLY!!! small.  Predominently corn starch....may be the way to go next time.",1
"Works for me, need to be careful putting it to close to eyes it burns if you do",1
"If I could give 100 stars, I would. It doesn't leave my hair greasy or sticky. It's like placing baby powder in my hair, but w/ an incredible aroma that remains and has a smile remaining on my face ALL DAY.",1
"Bad spray nozzles. Ordered 3 cans, 2 so far is a total waste. Very expensive with little product to use from it.",0
"So mad I didn't know about this sooner! Works wonders on cold sores, too! Another product I had to buy for others, so they could see for themselves how great it is!",1
I love this makeup remover! So gentle and so effective. The bottle is large enough to last a good long time.,1
"This was a great deal to introduce myself to safety razor shaving. I have a larger set now, but I will keep this one for travel. There is a slight odor, but it goes away in a couple minutes.",1
"I really liked the color...its not a bright purple, but a deeper purple that would look good on most anyone. However, I found this pencil to be very soft-- I needed to sharpen it after its first use! Its softness does not allow for a thin, crisp line to be drawn, if that's what you're looking for. It also smudges easily; don't count on it to last throughout the day. I really wanted to like this, but I won't be repurchasing and would not recommend.  Bummer!",0
"Yuck.  I just didn't like it. I purchased it a year ago and still use it from time to time so I don't waste it but I feel it doesn't get my hair clean and I'm not able to style it after I shampoo.  The best way I can describe it is it feels like I've shampooed with a bar of soap, so I use it on days when I'm just running errands or putzing around the house.  Will not buy again.",0
smells terrible,0
I love this mascara. You can apply it for a very long time because it stays wet a long  time.,1
I ordered a pearlized pink and got tan,0
button to change directions as you move around your hair.  I got my hair tangled up in it.  I want a refund.,0
This stuff is incredible!,1
This is an instant relief for thining hair. It's easy to apply and doesn't stain clothes,1
"Definitely recommend the 5%, the 10% is too strong and caused major drying out of my skin.  I love this because its not too harsh and has great results. I have occasional breakouts throughout the month and i cant remember the last time I had a breakout once I started using this product in conjunction with a good moisturizer.",1
"Excellent product ,did a great job on the whitening. I recommend this products .",1
"Like others have mentioned here, this is a counterfeit product. It is loose, runny, and barely moisturizing. Buy directly from the brand if you want the real thing!",0
"Great shadows, cute small case",1
"If you are a professional this clipper is very weak .I bought one from beauty supply was enough for me to try it on  fine hair to realize how weak the motor is and has a disturbing vibration in your hand very tiring , very weak product . If you want a good one go for Wahl Senior.",0
Not my favorite,1
Bought this awhile ago looking for smudge proof eyeliner since apparently end of the day I looked like a raccoon.  Paid more than I wanted for this item but it had good reviews.  I wouldn't recommend it - for me at least it didn't deliver.  It still smudged after a couple of hours.  Found Loreal to be more reliable recently and less expensive too.  At the end of the day (more hours than Lord&Berry lasted) and I don't look like a raccoon..if anything the Loreal smudge proof pencil just kind of disappears after 10 hours but it doesn't smudge. Save yourself some dollars and go with Loreal or even Covergirl,0
Does not work on gel polished nails. Very messy trying to foil wrap soaked cotton balls. Also tried dipping polished nails into a bowl of product.,0
"If I could provide no stars for this product, I would.  I was very excited ordering this eyeliner because it had such excellent reviews. After ten minutes of wearing this eyeliner, I looked like a ghoul.  All of the liner from my top lid dropped below my bottom lid.  Horrible product.  Thank goodness I always try new eye  products at home before being social.  I would not recommend this to anybody and wish I could get my money back.",0
Not a bad shaving cream for the price,0
"This lotion keeps my tan for months! People actually ask me why I am tan, and I always recommend this lotion. It's also a godsend for burns: it instantly soothes burns, and allows you to skip the terrible peeling phase.",1
Ordered 2 of the Red Door sprays.  They were not what was picturered or what it has been in past.  They have changed the bottle and the cologne.  Not sure if will purchase again.  Always loved th cologne and just not the same.,0
Use this right before heading out,1
"Within 36 hours of using this product, I had a very bad reaction. My skin started to get dry and scaly with lots of raised bumps. It actually looks like my skin is thicker. My skin looked about 10 years older. It was very dry and itchy. It's been about 6 days since I used it and things are starting to get better. I tried moisturizing and that didn't seem to help. Yesterday, I put neosporin on it and that finally seemed to help. No idea what could cause this but I'm so glad I didn't try to continue to use this product. The symptoms have persisted for so long!

UPDATE: It's been 9 days since I last used the product (used it for 3 applications total) and my eyes still burn and are red. I just tried to take make-up off and I felt like I was rubbing my skin raw. I can not wear make-up again until this is resolved. Aside from the itching and swelling, it burns as if I've gotten a bad sunburn on my eyelids. Ugh. I called the dermatologist and they recommended hydrocortisone cream until this resolves. I hope it will!",0
"I'm a nurse, who has often wond up with red, dry hands, by the end of my shift, with several hand washings and purell foam/gel. I have seen improvement with the skin on my hands, by wearing these gloves a couple of times, during the week. They are very pricey, but they work well. I use lotion, before putting on the gloves. I usually wear them to bed and let them work overnight.",1
THIS REQUIRES MAN HANDS TO OPERATE! PERHAPS IT'S ME BUT I CAN'T MANIPULATE IT.,0
"My hair is color treated, flat, straight and getting progressively thinner with age. It looks so thin lately that it's really become an issue for me. So far, I absolutely love the results I'm getting with R+Co Dallas Thickening Shampoo. It makes my hair look and feel noticeably fuller and thicker, yet the texture still feels soft and smooth. Other thickening shampoo I've tried seem to add volume by drying out my hair too much and making it frizzy. But with R+Co Dallas Thickening Shampoo, I get the added volume I want and my hair still feels manageable, smooth and even has some added bounce after blow drying with a round brush. My thin hair doesn't look or feel drier and actually looks revitalized after using this shampoo.

R+Co Dallas Thickening Shampoo is safe for color treated hair (according to R+Co customer service) and has UV protection. My hair looks clean and shiny after working a small amount throughout my hair and rinsing well. This shampoo has moderate fragrance out of the bottle, though the scent barely lingers in my hair. I like the scent even though I'm not much of a fragrance fan- I'm not sure of the exact fragrance, but I think it hints of citrus and lavender. This shampoo is sulfate and paraben free, gluten free and vegan, though it doesn't appear to be a chemical free product based on the ingredient list. Still, I love the results and recommend this thickening shampoo for those looking for a product to help with thin, flat or fine hair. Made in the USA.",1
"This product really helps to cover bald spots and very thin hair.  It does take a bit to cover and it is expensive, but really worth it for the good feeling it gives.  Be careful when using because it does make a mess around the bathroom since particles are ""flighty"".  Have purchased many times and will continue to purchase.",1
"My husband is loving shaving now and his face is much smoother! He's never had a better shave, than before using these products.",1
Good product!,1
Worthless. Took a chance for the frown lines around my mouth.... No change at all !,0
"This product leaves your skin feeling like you just sprayed it with liquid sugar. I have never left a bad review for anything before, but this is horrible.",0
"I am a big fan of EltaMD UV SPF 46, but this was the first time I purchased (by accident) the tinted version. The product goes on smooth and for a tinted moisturizer, I was surprised how much I liked it at first. However, within a few days of using this, I started breaking out and it causes the redness in my skin to flair up. Doesn't really moistures either.",0
"This might work well for others, but this brand made my scalp incredibly irritated.  Also, the color has a greenish tinge, which was NOT the look I was going for.  Nanogen and Cobuki have worked better for me.",0
Doesn't seem like the real product from the manufacturer. I've used this brand before but this one seems cheap and ineffective as if it's not authentic.,0
"I love the coolness of this around my eyes. It's kinda weird to apply though. It's not really a cream, hard to describe the texture, but once you start applying to your skin it goes on easily & works great.",1
"I wanted to like this so bad, but I really hate it. I have tried other moisturizers from bioderma like the pink one and the renewing purple cream, but they are not as bad as this one... This cream just sits on top of your skin and makes your skin look really greasy and gross. I have to use a loose powder on my skin to make it feel and look normal.

Even though I did not like it on my face, I did like it on my hands. I noticed a big difference when I applied it on my hands before bed.",0
This was used with other acne medicines and it cleansed my face very well. I t did not leave my face dry. I would recommend this. It is the same product the dermatologist sells.,1
"Something wrong with product, very watery",0
"Got this for my mother, the cream is great but the pump arrived broken.  Just go to the Sabon store or website don't waste your time with this one.",0
pretty good iron just time consuming if you have alot of hair but I like the item,1
It's pricey but is definitely a great bronzer.,1
"love this stuff! the best, always! use a hair dryer and get even a better hold!",1
"It does what it's supposed to, and it smells nice.  A little goes a long way.",1
"I was recently in Florence, Italy and my luggage (with my face care products) was lost...omg!  What to do??  No stranger to the wonders of Italian farmacias, I knew that I would find SOMETHING to tide me over until (if and - when) my luggage showed up.  At the farmacia near Santa Maria Novella, the staff was immensely helpful and sympathetic to the ""lost luggage - need face care"" scenario.  I tried to explain what I needed...hydration serum (among other things).  The clerk brightened up and pointed to the display of Lierac.  I was completely unfamiliar with this line, but desperate.  It wasn't inexpensive, but I figured it was probably a case of ""you get what you pay for"".  OMG - my skin was so happy!!  It felt like new skin.

Lierac has since discontinued this serum, much to my dismay, but I am trying another of theirs from the Lierac website.  I expect to be just as amazed.  Why don't we have products like this here in the U.S.?? (I've tried them all, I'm sure, and this beats anything.)

Anyway - if you can still find this - like here, on Amazon, get it!!",1
"This stuff works great! It has a nice strong hold - a little more tacky feeling than American Crew Fiber. The finish is matte and it needs little to no restyling. The hold isn't crunchy in any way either.
The product itself functions very well.

What makes me choose this product over others though is the ingredients. Most cosmetics have many harmful chemicals that cause neurotoxicity, organ system toxicity, reproductive harm, and cancer. This has very few of those elements compared to other cosmetic hair products. See [...]

Overall there is limited danger from this product - though I'd prefer less and would switch to less risk if I knew of one.",1
"Got this lotion at a high end hotel and loved it. Slathered it on arms and legs to beat dry air on a frigid week. Loved the small, and it was non-greasy. Hoarded the extra little bottles for home, but by the second day, I noticed rough red spots on my arms and legs. By the third day my skin was like sandpaper and I was itching,  when I got home, I switched to my usual bland soap (dove) and lotion (aveeno), and the bumps and itching began to subside. After three days, I was fine.

So I highly recommend unless you tend to have a reaction to fragrances in lotions.",0
"Very similar to hanz de Fuko claymation. My personal preference would this over claymation as far as application, texture, and hold seems to be just about the same",1
"great lubrication, good shave",1
Doesn't last,0
Love this on my fine hair.  Shampooing has been damaging my hair drying it out.  This is a great cleanser with conditioner.  It saves time in the shower.  I am not having to follow up with my 3 minute miracle conditioner that I usually use.,1
Goes on smooth,1
My brows are sparse and this does not fill well.  I think if I had more/longer eyebrow hairs I would like this product. It's expensive for what it is though - you could probably get similar results from a drug store brand.,0
It makes your hair really curly for most of the day just like I had gotten a perm by just scrunching it upside down and air drying. Just wish it would last until I had to wash my hair again!,1
"I used to use this product religiously and I'm very familiar with the scent. Unless it's been totally changed I'd be willing to be this is a fake. It works fairly well, but i love the real wen product it work like magic.",0
This product was one of my favorite blow dryers. After only a few months it just stopped working. I tried the instructions to reset it and nothing worked. I would not buy the product again only for that reason.,0
"The Supertool 2"" curling iron arrived timely, a quality product, but the barrel was too large for my daughter's shorter hair style.  I had to figure out how to make a return and the vendor Lamerchendise was very accommodating.  Lamerchendise replied to my emails promptly with specific directions and waived a portion of their restocking fee. As long as I receive the refund through Amazon appropriately I would purchase again in the future.",0
Great Hair Powder!  Prefer to others I've used.,1
Pretty duo of eyeshadows. I gave this to my granddaughter and she loves it. Especially the pink shade.,1
Wishing I could give it 0 stars. I received this item immediately took it out the package to smell it. I noticed right away that the item smelled way to much like alcohol with a hint of perfume. NOT what it should smell like. So I called CS and they told me to contact the manufacturer for refund. So I emailed the manufacturer and heres their response.,0
Not to empress about this product I really can see the difference!,0
"Oy vey. Horrible, horrible rashes erupted everywhere this touched my skin. Very disappointed with this product. Returned and good riddance.",0
My girlfriend uses this because her face is really oily. She had been using liquid make up which makes things even worse. She now uses mineral make up with this mattifying lotion and her face doesn't look glossy by the end of the work day anymore. Her skin looks normal thanks to this lotion.,1
Product recommended by my beautician and I purchased it at the salon but it was very expensive.  I like that it's silver free and leaves my hair soft and easy to manage. I purchased the combo pack at a better price on your site.,1
wish this product was easily available in retail in London Ontario - excellent - product,1
Chips easily,0
"Ok, so if you are looking to help keep from getting stretch marks or even to reduce them, this cream will not help with those results. It is a nice cream. It goes on easy and non greasy. A few others mention a scent. I did not have any issues with the scent. Again, however, that was not why I was looking forward to this cream. Don't waste your money for no results.",0
"Having naturally curly hair, this is the only product I will use on it. Gives support without weighing it down. Highly recommend this product!",1
"These were ordered as roll-on, instead I got spray. The lids were loose and the files were filled  two different levels in the three files one of them 1/3 empty ..
And they do not smell like the English Laundry  Ive got before..",0
"It seems I'm on a constant search for a quality under eye concealer. I have very fair skin and constant dark circles. I've tried expensive products (like Smashbox) and $10 and under drug store products (Cover Girl, Maybelline, etc.). I'd say this product is comparable in quality to a drug store product with the price of an expensive brand.

The product does go on very smoothly, and I think it will last a long time--a little bit goes a long way. But as far as coverage goes, it doesn't last through the day. For the last several days, I've applied my Cover Girl stick under one eye and the em cover up under the other eye. The em has a more yellow tinge, but once I put my foundation over it, the yellow disappears. By noon, the dark circles are completely back. I've come to expect it from a cheap product, but from a product that's nearly $20? That's unacceptable. Why would I pay twice the price to have the same result?

I had been very interested in trying Michelle Phan's makeup line, but this product does not make me want to try any of her other products.",0
My hair got real frizzy using this. I didn't care for it.,0
I like this product,1
"I really like this palette. I bought it because it seemed to be a ""bet of"" collection and I liked that idea. I have a full size of Bahama Mama (and love it) but not any of the others and I had heard good things about this palette. Emily Noel loved it and she is great! I trust her reviews. The colors go on easily and blend nicely. You might need a touch up at the end of the work day, but I think they have pretty reasonable lasting power. Plus it would be a good travel one because it has blush, shadow, and lip products all in one. Pretty cool. I would recommend this product.",1
Made my inner elbow ceases break out in a stinging raised rash actually woke me up in the middle of the night stinging. Return window closed by 3 days! Disappointing when reviews were good. Wouldn't by again!,0
I haven't noticed any differences.. But I only use it once a day after I wash my face. It does not irritate my skin so that is nice,0
"Buyer beware!!!  There should be a strong warning on the packaging of this product!  I applied the cream ONE time 2 days ago and my face continues to be bright red, very hot to the touch with a rash all over it.  When I woke up this morning, my face was even more puffy and red and my eyes were almost swollen shut!  I am freaking out as I have no idea how long this reaction is going to last or what I can do about it short of going to the emergency room!  I might add,  that I have never had any type of allergic reaction from any creams or lotions in the past. This stuff is scary!",0
Excellent product and shipment was speedy.,1
I haven't used much of this but the bottle is so small that I am afraid to use it everyday. I give it 2 stars because I think the price is way too high for the amount you receive.,0
"This dryer is heavier and took longer to dry my hair than the 15 year old dryer I was replacing. I hate it. Also, the on/off button is right where you hold the dryer, so it's hard to use it without turning it off by mistake. Very annoying. I'm sending it back.",0
"I have used this Glycolix 10-2 cleanser and pads everynight (literally) for 5 plus years now and I get compliments on my skin all the time.  The second it runs out, I can notice my skin going back to its acne-prone tendencies in just a few days.  This keeps my acne at bay.  The catch with any skin care regimen is consistency.  Keep this up daily at night before bed, you won't regret it.  Happy to find it on Amazon now, I always purchased from my Derm (who private labeled it) and then through Dermatologistrx.com.  Happy its 2 day shipping for free now! Weee :)",1
"Product was OK gets the job done. However, when I touch my hair just a tiny bit, it rubs right off. Which Caboki does not do, therefore Caboki works a lot better.",0
I like how creamy and smooth it is. It really helps with dry skin and has reduced the amount of itching.  We are also using it on our baby daughter and it does not irritate her skin.,1
I was very satisfied with this as I have been with all of their products I have used,1
"Heats up in seconds, is smooth on your hair, love the digital temperature view.",1
"Lash Loading? Talk about a hefty claim that seriously does not hold up. This mascara is more like ""smear"" loading. I usually use a volume mascara since my lashes are so light and thin. When a product promises :

High definition volumizing mascara. Inspired by the runway and behind-the-scenes tricks, JAPONESQUE Lash Loading mascara creates incredible lash drama and a super-charged false lash effect""

It better come through especially when its twice as much as the mascara I usually use (covergirl). First when I took the brush out, huge glob of mascara was at the brush end I had to quickly plunge it back in a few times to get rid of it, or risk it being all over my face. First coat was weak, second coat was the same. It gave no volume, it loaded no lashes, every time I brushed it on a bit would ""dink"" right onto my eyelid cause the formula is so runny. I was using make up remover left and right. In the end I probably used 4 coats and it was like using one. I would not ever buy this again.",0
Ordered  3.  2 were fine.... one was empty and the too was off.  Leaked all over the package.,0
"A little ""grainy"" and doesn't last all day for as it did for others. I use this both in the morning and at before bed.",1
Excellent,1
"I just had my hair straightened and was told to find a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner so I, based on reviews, I ordered this product. I didn't like it at all. The smell was awful. Way too strong of a perfume smell, and not a good perfume. The conditioner smelled better but it left my hands feeling very dry all day. I can only imagine it has dried out my hair as well. I'm sending it back.",0
Good stuff. Magical at destroying whiteheads.,1
Ouch. This stuff hurts my face! I've stopped using it.,0
Really disappointed with this product. It just left my lashes flat and goopy. My $10 mascara works better then this. I'm going to find out if I can return it.,0
Not worth the money. Has a smell some may not like. Does not hydrate well compared to other products I have purchased. I barely use this stuff.,0
"I was very excited about the reviews and I like to buy the same line and follow the manufacturer`s instructions, so I bought the shampoo, the conditioner and the leave in. I used them all and my hair is sticky and without movement. I did not approve the purchase, but I will try one more time to make sure I still have to keep trying to find the best products for my curly-fine hair.",0
itches scalp,0
"Smells great
Works great",1
Beautiful color! The perfect pale pink. Have already worn multiple times.,1
"These are nice, refreshing towels for your eyes. I use them mainly because I suffer from dry and occasionally itchy eyes in the winter.  These seem helpful. I think they would also be good for cleaning makeup and such, but have not used them for that purpose. The quality seems good. I do think they are a bit expensive, so only 4 stars for value. Still, good cloths that do the job they claim to do.",1
"The product itself is as described.  The problem is with the fact that the jar was nearly empty.  I could literally see the bottom of the jar through the top window.  There was no glitter in the box, so this wasn't a shipping issue, just a matter of the seller shipping a nearly empty jar of product. After paying $19.00 plus shipping and waiting nearly 2 weeks to receive the product, needless to say I was extremely disappointed.  I won't be doing business with this seller again.",0
good condition!,1
"I love the color, but it is not durable enough for me. I deal cards in Las Vegas and hand wash my dishes, so I may need a more durable polish than most. This chipped after the first few days. Retouching didn't seem to help stop the chips. My go to polish is Sally Hansen Triple Shine. I can get two weeks with a retouch one week in with this polish. My nails always look freshly done with that polish. But, I was looking for healthier alternatives. So far, no luck!",0
"I like the color, would like it to be thicker, but mainly am concerned about the harmful ingredients if any in this product.
I do not read ""ingredient""  language. If the company knows there are no harmful ingredients, please just say so in
plain language.",0
"The delivery was great but the perfume is not the original, is so different.",0
it goes on sheer and is easy to build up. i like that it gives me a natural-looking flush. i rarely use it on my lips because it's kinda drying,1
Nice bronzer! Love jane iredale products!,1
"I wish I could say the same as all the other ladies but I guess I'm part of the small percentage. I'm 39 weeks with my first pregnancy and I have used this cream twice daily for the entire time and although I have gained 50 pounds, is not all on my belly. I got stretch marks around belly button and downwards. I wish this wasn't the outcome. Although they are hardly noticeable, they are there and that's the whole point.",0
I like the results and will reorder,1
"Unless you have the glove, don't bother. It stains hands even when I rubbed hand lotion on my palms first.",0
"I used to have very good skin before using this product. I may have one or two pimples from time to time, but never ever had acnes in my entire life even when I hit the puberty. I have so much acne on my entire face including the cheeks, the chin, and the forehead that my friends have started to ask me about it. Be VERY careful of applying any medically unproven product to your skin, even if you have good skin like myself.",0
"Defective right out of the box. Turns on (lights up), but doesn't heat up. Also, weird small rust-like spots on shaft, 5 total. Some could be scratched off, some couldn't. Returning and disappointed.",0
"Took a little bit of patience to wait for the heat indicator to let me know the curler was ready for use, but overall, works great!",1
I love the product but I got a 12 oz.bottle but got a pump for a 4oz bottle,0
Expected the color to be much darker. After 3 codes of application the color still too light compering to the color on the bottle.,0
"Great product, works well with my hair, thick. Does not weigh down your hair and always soft and smells great.",1
"Great machine, and dries very quickly. Treat her well, and this dryer will last you long.",1
Recently used this product. Works very well. The cap often comes loose from the hose but other than that no problems.,1
I tried this for the first time and the smell is just way too strong. Had to wash it off after 20 minutes.,0
Better than expected,1
"This concealer seems to work pretty well, I got it to cover some scars, it didn't work for that but other concealers I've tried didn't work either. It must just be hard to cover up scars. Still trying to find something that will work :(",1
I like it - wish there were more sparkles.,1
"I kind of hate this product. I feel like it applies in clumps and it hard to even see on the lid. If I sharpen it regularly and use a hair dryer to warm it I can sort of make it work, but I will probably end up throwing it away. It is a shame because I paid a lot for it.",0
"I've tried a number of Dermablend products, and have been disappointed. They aren't full coverage and nothing out of the ordinary. They are exactly the same as any of the heavier foundations on the market.

I tested this particular product on a bruise. I applied several layers and you could still see it.  Not impressed.",0
"The color is listed as ""light brown"" that is way off. This color is closer to black and is very dull. Also, the coverage is not that great. I would not recommend.",0
"I have been using this product for about a year. I have tried other, more expensive products without much success. Using Nectifirm twice a day has improved the appearance of my neck.",1
Doesn't smell so good and I find it doesn't really live up to its description for the price. Better to get a cheaper one for the results you get with this one.,0
This was received on time. No problems definitely the real product. Great manly scent but Doesn't stay that long but was kind of expected being this is a EDT and not a Parfum! Make sure you know the difference EDT last about 4-6 hours while a Parfum can last 8-10 some  all day like HM or DB! I was satisfied with product just wish it stuck just a little longer before needing reapply.,1
"Love it! Smells so good, not overpowering",1
Laura Geller products are my favorite cosmetics.  Colors are true.  The product stays on and I've never had a problem with them clogging pores or causing me any skin irritations.  Highly recommend!,1

"This is neither a cleaner, nor a moisturizer.  Serums have a specialized use. This serum claims to soften fine lines and wrinkles, to even skin tone, and give a glow. Im at the age, mid 50s, where wrinkles are starting to pop out everywhere. This smells nice, slightly like oranges, goes on easy, nice and smooth, not greasy. For my skin, I can see immediate improvement in the evenness of the skin tone and an overall healthy look. My foundation has moisturizer in it, so I put Bliss Serum on and then my foundation. At night I use the Serum and then a moisturizer, not of this brand.  It seems like I am holding back more wrinkles, hard to say if its this serum, the moisturizer, or the cleaner, or the combination of all.  I do like what it does right away to my face, I've found myself wearing foundation less because of it.

Its a serum which is a relatively new term in cosmetics.  Wikipedia (Nov 2015) defines serum as a buzzword for lotion in the cosmetic market.  A few cosmetic sites say there is no formal definition, but cosmetic serums are rapidly absorbed and highly potent. They are the cousins of lotions and moisturizers. They typically focus on one of these areas: dry skin, aging, dark spots.  My concern because it does absorb into your skin so fast is with the ingredients of which I am not qualified to speak to and will watch for others opinions on this.",1
"I ordered and paid significantly more for the SPF 50. The box said 50, but the product inside was SPF 30.",0
"To give you some background, I bought this set for my boyfriend for valentines day. Upon using this set twice, both times it left his face very nicked up which is a problem he does not usually have. I also tried the gel and Razer on my bikini area and wish I never did. Not only was the shave uncomfortable to begin with but it also gave me a yeast infection....in which case, I'm 22 years old and have never had a yeast infection till the day after I used it so I think it's safe to say the shaving cream was the cause of the cream. Never again. Nice razer, nice case, nice smelling products but terrible results.",0
"Happy with the color and how it blended in with my hair, however this is very expensive for the amount of product you get.  I use a cover-up sparingly for about 1-2 weeks before I have my hair professionally colored. I've used it once and it's practically gone, I'll probably get two uses out of it.",0
"I've been buying these for 25 years and they have of course gone downhill quality-wise over the years. But, the price has gone down also and so I can buy several and they still last long enough for me to be happy with my purchases.",1
"soooo very sad that i am past the return date.  i used it this morning for the first time and it is sooooo NOT OBAGI product.
wash is pink and has a funny smell.  wrong color.  wrong smell.  wrong product.  :/",0
"Nice weight, easy to use.  Great product even if your new to wet shaving.",1
"My skin is hideously sensitive, and it has bad reactions to a vast majority of products. However, my cheeks and chin tend to be really dry so I can't go without some kind of moisturizer. After using this nightly for a few weeks now, it doesn't seem to break me out, which is a huge plus. It does impart some softness and moisture to the skin, but not to a great degree: it gets rid of that tight feeling that comes with dry skin, but it doesn't eradicate all flakiness and dry patches. It does not have an overwhelming fragrance like so many products do (what very little bit of scent there is, is more along the lines of a general, unscented lotion).

All in all, I really like this. While I wish it moisturized just a bit more than it does, the fact that it doesn't cause reactions in sensitive skin is a very big bonus, so I'd definitely recommend this.",1
"This is my first safety razor, but after reading a ton I decided to go with this one. It's a really good razor if you don't have hands like Shaq, or like to hold the razor close to the comb. After a couple of months, I have Feather blades in this baby, haven't cut myself once and I am getting the best shaves of my life. It really didn't have the learning curve I was expecting. I may get another razor later down the road, but right now, I am very happy with this.",1
The product failed within a few months.,0
"So I saw my first wrinkle across my forehead and freaked out. I bought this stuff after trying a sample of it. I had managed to find it somewhere for $50 or so. For the life of me I can't remember how long the bottle lasted me, but it was a while. I felt that there was enough improvement that I seriously considered buying another bottle, but I simply couldn't afford to keep getting it at full price. Oh! And read the instructions before you use it... you have to put it on in little Xs on your forehead and between your eyes, so if you just rub it all over your forehead it's not going to do the same thing.",1
"product seal was broken. I did not run out of my previous one until yesterday, so i had not opened it immediately. Due to this I am outside the return window.",0
Makes baby smell awesome and moisturizers skin. Worth every penny!!!,1
Ok I guess just not for me. I guess hair too thin,1
"this cleared up my mild chest and back acne within a fews days of use, i used the whole bottle and was going to buy another but i thought id try rubbing alcohol alone (since thats the first ingredient in this) and it cleared up the acne just as well (i was out of the glytone for a week so i had a breakout to test my theory on)

Tip: don't spray the glytone, you'll inhale it and cough, unscrew the top and pour it on a cotton round, then wipe it on your chest and back instead",1
Does not smell feminine but even if it was changed into a cologne i dislike the scent,0
Shipped fast but the bottle did not come with a dripper so no way to put on nails so disappointed with this purchase.,0
It works as well as you would hope it would!,1
"As with most palettes, I don't wear all of the colors. The ones that I use, I use daily. They go on smooth, and last all day.  I do use the LORAC Eye Shadow Primer, and I do believe this helps.",1
I've been using this product for years.,1
Ill never order anything else again. This is my low-maintenance makeup miracle. I use a flat brush and swirl a bit around my shiny or too pink skin and I like the way it looks!  I have sensitive combination  skin.,1
"This stuff was awful. MY hair is really thin up front, i brought this thinking it would cover the bald spots and it just like power it does not have hair fibers in it. I put it on and it looked like i poured this brown power on my scalp. in the light it looked awful. i was really hoping it would work cause i use there wands now that have hair color on them. but i wanted a change so i throught this would be better but its not. sherry lucas",0
"I got this blow dryer just last week, and 2 days later I smelled something smokey coming from the wire, and now it won't even power on if the cable isn't turned a certain angle. Now looking for a replacement or refund, but there is no section to contact the seller.",0
I like the scent but it does smell like cotton candy!,1
it was ok,0
It wasn't all that,0
"I have used Pureology Real Creme for many years and it is perfect for my hair type.  Pureology discontinued Real Creme in 2011 and I was told Illuminating Curl Shaping Lotion was the replacement - not!  It is a completely different product from Real Creme and it doesn't work at all on my fine curly hair, just flattens it out! I can't use it.",0
It did not work as I had hoped.  A family member living overseas has an almost identical product.  Only difference is hers has natural bristles while this one has synthetic.  I have used both and find the natural bristles far superior.  This product does not work on my hair and just tangles up and doesn't' turn. Had I not used the one my family member has I might have thought I was using it incorrectly.  This is not the case,0
"Very pleased with this size.  I have had Hot Tools in the past and like the brand.  It gets very hot, just as I wanted, and it's very reliable.",1
"I don't know what's with the rave reviews, perhaps brand loyalists?  Well, I bought this because this company used to make a self-tanner that was the best self-tanner I've ever seen, although a bit pricey.  It gave you a nice orangey glow, and unlike other tanners, it didn't make you break out in any way or discolor/exaggerate blemishes on the face, etc.  Okay, so the tanner appears to be no more, yet this crap product lives on.  So I get it, and it actually smells and feels like the tanner did, like heavy orange Vitamin C smell.  For a moment, I was excited, hoping they had screwed up and sent me the tanner, but sadly no.  Also, after exclusive use for four days in a row, I began to break out with acne, which I killed with Witch Hazel here in the winter and now my face is peeling.  Great.  However, I can't say for sure that this was due to this product, yet by association and all the other things I dislike about it, why not assume so.  So when it goes on your face it isn't that moist; it feels thick and dry, almost grainy.  I can't really judge whether it 'moisturized' me or not because the smell and texture were so annoying, so for that reason and the fact their discontinued self-tanner was cool, I'll give it 2 stars rather than 1.",0
Works great and quickens dry of nail polish underneath. Make sure not to apply it to nails that are too wet or it will streak the polish.,1
"After using out of this container, it doesn't hold well, I think the product is not genuine Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine. Will not buy from this supplier again.

Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine is the only hair spray I use. I've used it for years because it holds well and doesn't leave your hair sticky, brushes out easily and it smells good.",0
"The L'anza Healing Volume Zero Weight Gel is a MUST for anyone with thinner hair looking for hold. As a woman who frequently gets blonde highlights, I know what it's like to struggle with brittle hair that also needs body. This gel formula is so light it does not weigh the hair down, and it adds an extra softness you will not find with other similar products. The shipping was fast and the item was sealed- so props to this seller. Great item!",1
"I used this after a shampoo and towel dry.  I wasn't expecting much, since my hair is thin.  It actually feels better than before, more body, but best of all, the shine is quite noticeable.  The weird smell goes away, thankfully.

I applied this with my hands and avoided the scalp.",1
"Don't buy this item.
I have long thick hair and for months have been trying source and curling iron that would actually work and the curls would stay in.
I read all of the reviews on here ordered from the states and then had to order the convertor for a further 20 to find they don't work, the curls were basic and didn't stay in for longer than an hour, that was including lots of hair spray!!! Please don't waste your money they don't work.",0
Seriously the best highlighter ever!,1
Hard to use and it was almost falling apart,0
made my hair feel sticky...and gross,0
boar bristle brush? there are probably really only 15-20 actual boar hairs in this brush. . . don't bother (sarcasm heavy on the boar bristles. . there are more than stated however not by much),0
Best moisturizer ever!!!,1
"I received an empty box, what a joke!",0
"This is my favorite self tanning lotion. It's kinda messy, but it is the only one I will use. Thanks",1
I hate washing my hair everyday so I need to use a dry shampoo.  The problem with dry shampoos is that they are DRYING.  My hair is already dry so the usual dry shampoos would really make it look unhealthy and well....dry.  I got this one because it said it was also moisturizing.  And it is!  Without being too greassy which is also key.  Give it a try.  You'll like it.,1
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, MY TEETH STAYED THE SAME COLOR ALMOST A MONTH LATER! DO NOT BUY THIS! Go to the dentist, save your money!",0
My husband loves Proraso shaving products!,1
"Thick, slick lather. Pleasant scent that doesn't overwhelm. Exactly what I wanted in a shave soap. I can see why this product is the standard against which all other shave soaps are measured.",1
totally unworthy the money.,0
Smells so good and makes your shower a spa-like experience.  The shower oil foams when you shower and makes your skin very moisturized and nicely scented.  The bathroom smells great too.,1
"I use this on my husband's nails, looks very professional",1
"Some people like the MM butter, some people like the MM oil. I ran out of the butter and bought the oil again for my second pregnancy. But I will say this -- USE one of these products. I don't have one stretch mark and I had a 10-lb baby. I used this nightly with a crap load of other oil-like products that worked like a charm to produce a great baby and no marks. Okay, the great baby was me.",1
I have been using this for sometime now and it really works well. One thing is that the page says 5.3 oz and it comes in 5.0 oz.,1
"Smelled good and felt good, but unfortunately didn't help me.",0
"It's messy and EXTREMELY sticky. The majority of my day wearing this was spent trying to keep my hair out of my face due to the fact that this gloss became superglue and attracted stray strands of hair- sticking them to my lips. Don't let the color fool you, this product's pigmentation is subpar at best and you could find a lipgloss of this quality at the drugstore for less money.",0
"I seem to collecting alot of CND colors in this shade.
Thats okay they all look great and stay put. :)",1
"I used this shampoo for years.  My hairdresser got me to switch to a different brand for a while, then suddenly I couldn't find it.  So I decided to go back to the Nioxin system & I love it!  The shampoo in particular lathers up so much better than what I had been using I can't believe I didn't notice it before",1
Boooooo,0
"I do not like it. Is to dark for me, it looks weird on my skin. I throw it away.",0
great smell. lasts long,1
"This eye primer glides on smoothly and makes the eye shadows more pigmented. I use it with my other eye shadows and they blend and look like a dream. This primer doesn't have that tacky feel to it nor does it feel like it's drying out my eyelids since I have very oily eyelids. These makes the em shadows and other shadows for that matter last long. You only need a little bit. My concern is the price. $15 bucks for a small tube? When I got it in the mail I thought it was going to be a tad bit bigger than that. Nonetheless, it's a good product.",1
I do not like this blow dryer it takes forever to dry my hair. Definitely not worth the $200 spent. I have had much less expensive dryers that work much more efficiently.,0
"very effective for an at home treatment, I love these. they make you look refreshed, exfoliate and smooth out fine lines.",1
Love this! Great protection without being heavy or greasy.,1
My nails are thin and brittle and hoped for a solution.  This did not help.  In order to take it off requires acetone - which is lethal to already weakened nails.,0
"WEN has nothing new with this product other than another ""average"" conditioner.  Suave or Vo5 conditioners are actually better at cleaning/conditioning your hair as they have the chlorides essestial for ""clensing"".  Wen has too much ""guck"" in it. It builds up on hair.

When I used this product my hair was ""heavy"" and dull.  You don't need to spend so much or use as much if you co-was with vo5 or suave.  I actually discovered how great these inexpensive conditioners were.  I have always used expensive conditioners thinking they were what is best for my hair and tangles...I have thin, dry hair and much of it.  I have used Biolage conditioning balm as my favorite..since I have gone with co-washing (no shampoos) vo5 is now my favorite. Comb glides through effortlessly and does as good if not better than Biolage or WEN.",0
Worked well with problem blemishes.,1
"it is a fantastic product. I bought both the N3000 and Foreo. I love this so much, compared to N3000. It cleans your face so well and never leave it dry. definitely recommend this",1
This acne treatment does nothing except make you look orange where applied.  Do not apply before bed as you will have stained pillow cases,0
Good light cleansing foaming gel. Doesnt get the job done if you have oily skin and wear makeup.,1
The first time using this polish and it is very thick and does not go on evenly. Won't let me return and I'm very disappointed. I won't be buying polish off Amazon again. I usually love Essie.,0
"I have been purchasing EDP's from Amazon over the course of the last few years with no problems and have been very pleased, however that has changed recently and this will be my last purchase of EDP's or EDC's from Amazon or any online retailers.  I've read the reviews and realized that there was always a ""risk"" buying EDP's at what appears to be a ""good price"" and ""good value"" scenario but it had been no problem.  With this recent purchase this item is either very, very old/expired or ""fake"" - the bottle is correctly labeled EDP but the fragrance lasts only minutes, even an EDC would last longer.  I was able to resolve this problem with Amazon although I remain disappointed because I believed that by ordering an item direct from Amazon I would never have encountered this problem.",0
"Usually use a spray ""dry shampoo"".  This works fairly decent.  Is a little more messy, but is really easy to apply and really does help with giving my hair an extra day to go without shampoo.  This also helps extends the color life of my hair.",1
"This eyeliner goes on smoothly, but it IS NOT smear-proof. It started smearing in the first hour. I arrived at work and all morning, I had to wipe off the smears and re-apply. This product should not call itself smear-proof - that's very misleading. The square pencil fits too tightly in a regular sharpener.",0
"This particular hot air brush has only 250 watts. It is too Weak! It is about a quarter of the usual strength  of most hot air brushes, including some Helen of Troy versions that I have bought in the past. Hot air brush power can vary, but it is usually 1200 watts. The Amazon product description does not give power specifications, just barrel size. (Shame on Amazon)
However,  I also have some responsibility here because I have been buying hot air brushes for at least 15 years and I assumed standard product power and didn't double check. I should have been more cautious.",0
"For anyone who wants to prevent unsightly brown spots, sunscreen on the back of the hands is a must when driving. Those damaging UV rays come right through the windshield, and your hands get hit point blank.  Regular sunscreen is cheap, so I don't know why all the moisturizing hand creams with sunscreen are so darn expensive! At least this one leaves hands feeling wonderfully soft all day.",1
It is perfect no burn for me in Mexico,1
Love this. It heats up fast and I can do loose waves in my hair easily. I would recommend this.,1
Doesn't work.,0
"It's not worth the money! My hair was dry, and  I used it every second day for 2 weeks, and my hair are just as dry, if not more dry! It's not worth the money, and I would not recommended to anyone. In my view it's false advertising.",0
"Such a pretty color, but it is hard to take off because of the glitter, which is to be expected. The color is almost holographic and I have gotten many compliments on my nails when I wore this polish! Definitely recommend to others!",1
It's good!,1
"Excellent razor, simple, comfortable, forgiving.",1
I found it very heavy.  You have to use a very light touch or it looks like a mask. I am thinning it down in order to use it.,0
Thought it would feel and smell better,0
It literally makes my hair itchy.. and smell so bad.,0
Doesn't come with the defuser otherwise a good purchase.,1
The product arrived with a broken cover and scratch and dust on the bottle. It makes doubt if it is a fake Evian facial spray.,0
"Love this product! I give it a 4 start because I just started using it 2 days ago. Its doesn't burn not irritate my skin so far, and I have been using it for 2 days four times totals (day and night).",1
returned this item - great seller product did not work,0
"Personally, the smell was off and I have returned this product. big disappointment as I love the truffle therapy one-which I may buy instead.",0
"My mom uses this stuff. I was house sitting for them and needed some lotion because their water is, ""not normal""! I started to use her lotion, (which I don't usually use) and loved the way it made me smell. This is also good moisture, I feel moist but not too greasy such as how other lotions feel. I recomend, obviously, because I ordered a bottle.",1
"kinda expensive, not sure if it's worth it. but it did heal my lips",1
"I like this curling iron. I have owned several of them. The one complaint I have is that the spring/hinge wears out so fast. The curling iron comes with an extra hinge but after having mine for a few months it is squeaking. I can buy the springs for cheap at a hair store, so not a big deal. I just wish they made that part a little more durable.",1
"I had heard rave reviews for this conditioner, and am always trying out new shampoos and conditioners.  This may work for some people, but not me.  My hair was dull and lifeless after using.  The upside is that it smells good.",0
"I just got mine today and is perfect love it ..i have layers so this was perfect for straight hair. This is better then blow drying your hair and faster, it dose not give you curls is more for a straight hair look. If you want curly hair, this one is not the right one for you, try getting a smaller one. My hair looks like i just got out of the hair salon... Oh one last thing it heats quick too and medium heat is great it does it's work.",1
Great product,1
Sorry to say that I am pitching this one. It never held a charge for very long and now it's only good for two days before I have to charge it again. And it takes about 24 hours to charge. I used to have a Mia 2 for years and never had this problem. I just bought another Mia to replace this Fit. I don't know why the Fit is different and wanted to share my feedback if it's helpful to future buyers. I've had the Fit for a year.,0
Dry and cheap... this product is hard like a rock. I don't know if this is the intended consistancy. It has no shimmer just dull. Very disappointed,0
Nixon products are great for thinning hair.  The thickening gel gives hair extra body and really helps.  I have used Nixon products for 15+ years.,1
My skin loves this toner.,1
Smells nice,1
I love the Elta sunscreen so I thought I would try a few more products in their line.  I am really disappointed by the difference in quality.  I feel like there is a film on the top if my face in the morning that never got absorbed.,0
"I have bought several bottles of Klorane dry shampoo, and this one isn't as good as the others.  Not sure if it was because this has Nettle, instead of Oat.  Either way, I won't buy this type again.  Booooo.",0
I dislike the scent. This lotion smells like the tip of a Sharpie marker...,0
I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Product was not sealed and opened rolling around in box when I received it.  Most beauty products I purchase have a shrink wrap seal that tells you it's not been used.  It didn't have a sticker as some discribed but pretty sure it was a free sample.,0
Be very careful. I buy Hot Tools faithfully. This iron when I heated it up on medium heat the tip began melting to the iron. Unfortunately I didn't realize this & put a section of hair in to begin a curl. Immediate sizzle & hair burnt off. I think this iron is defective.  I've never had this issue with any Hot Tools irons. I'm returning this iron even though I'll have to dig the boxes out of the trash.,0
"There were many people who questioned the authenticity of this product. I have my current product purchased at a high end cosmetic store. I have now received this product. They are totally different in color, feel  and in transparency. It must be either a different formula or not authentic Vincent Longo. I have attached a photo. The left  smear is the original and the smear on the right is this product. You judge.",0
Love all Blinc products..they are amazing,1
Satisfied with purchase.,1
I beyond LOVE this product! But why has it more than doubled in price this year? Pure greed? Elta MD will surely lose customers by the droves...,0
"On the daily I only wear a tinted moisturizer.  Im getting married soon and was hoping to find something with a bit more coverage to even out my skin tone, while still looking natural.  Unfortunately this is not going to be it.  First off its too dark, which is not necessarily a product flaw, but I won't really be able to wear this by itself.  Second, even if it was the right shade its way to cakey and gunky feeling/looking for my liking.  I will mix it with either my moisturizer or another lighter foundation and see if that makes any difference.  But on its own, its just not that great.",0
This is a great product...it is a very small amount so you will have to reorder often...what I especially loved it that it doesn't have a heavy perfume smell...and clean smelling...feels great on your clean skin.,1
"I like this product. The person who wrote review that it was dry, must have gotten an old one. I 1st tried it when I got one in my Ipsy monthly bag and loved it. I then ordered it on Amazon. Only complaint it both caps/lids broke and now won't stay on. That's a problem when it's in your makeup bag.",1
"I would have rated the pencil a 5, but it is impossible to sharpen! That said...the hunt continues for the BEST product out there.",0
"I'm not sure, but I may be having a mild allergic reaction to something in this spray? Small buttons have appeared along my nose and forehead and between my eyes...
Other than that the spray is quite refreshing, though the smell of roses is very powerful at first! However, it goes away very quickly; I stop noticing it seconds later.",1
"Edit: 11 months into owning this curling iron and it has completely broke. 3 months ago the black end cap on the tip came off, and a piece inside broke so that I could not re-attach it. Since it was beyond the Amazon return policy, I kept using it, but noticed the heat wasn't retaining as it had before. Then on Christmas morning I turned it on and when I went to use it, found it to be cold. No heat. It was like the lights were on, but no one was home. I changed plugs, turned it off & on again, but the heating portion doesn't work anymore. Not even 1 year and it's toast. I've been loyal to conair until I tried this brand, and all my conairs lasted YEARS (the last being from when I got married until last January, 7 years! Back to conair I go.

I love this curling iron. It adjusts to the heat I need, and it leaves my curls and waves lasting all day into the next. I love how even the base where the cord attached rotates to avoid having a twisted cord. I'm in love and am so happy with it!",0
"I used by more then 6 years to refresh around of mine eyes, and works very good and taking away all discomfort of mine skin",1
Love this product!,1
"This product feels like velvet on your lips .Doesn't feel sticky or gummy at all.  Great quality, and the perfect nude shade.",1
Not quite as I expected.,0
The color is very pretty  The polish streaks  It is difficult to get a smooth coat  Maybe it is me  I read about this polish in  Shefinds.com or the Zoe report .com  And was entranced  But it just did not work for me  I gave it to a womens shelter,0
"I love the product but it was shipped as a present WITHOUT the top lid!
I wanted to give this as a gift, and it now it won't make a good impression without the lid!",0
Love the hairspray but it stopped spraying half way through the can. I tried all the Normal things cleaning the nozzle. Nothing worked.,0
"Obagi system works for me, I've used their products for  my wedding  almost 10 years  ago . I have adult acne, and nothing works better than Obagi..  I know why I went back, simply, it works.",1
Smells great,1
"This product felt greasy when applied and it did not leave my face feeling clean after I rinsed it off. Seems like it might be trying to be an ""all in one"" product and failing at it's primary purpose (a facial cleaner). I'm usually a big fan of JB products, but I would not recommend this product as facial cleaner.",0
This oil combined with professor fuzzworthys beard shampoo produce a very very soft beard. Tried several oils and this one works and smells the best.,1
I purchased this because I have very bad rosacea and extremely sensitive skin and it was recommended by a skin care group. Unfortunately it caused a negative reaction with my skin and I am unable to use it. Had to wash it off immediately after I used it.,0
Love!,1
Good product,1
"First this stuff is heavily scented. Very floral. I did notice when I used it on wet hair the smell faded significantly when the hair was dry.
It is very heavy on my hair, I have long, colored hair that is dry due to the weather and the color and the hard water I deal with.
I've had better luck with a pure argan oil (Purador is the brand I have now purchased on Amazon).
I've tried using this once a week, on wet and dry hair, using only one spray up to three and I am just not a fan. I think the pure argan oil which has zero fragrance, zero 'other' stuff works better. With that I put it in my hair the night before I am going to wash it and it's great. I apply it mid shaft to the ends.
I should mention I wash my hair every other day so it's quite annoying when the oil isn't absorbed and just makes my hair greasy not to mention making my brush greasy.
I'd recommend getting the Purador because even in the morning after I apply it (I use it lightly) I can brush my hair without making my brush greasy. And after I wash my hair it's amazing, shiny, healthy looking.",0
Best stuff on the market.,1
"I've heard very good things about this brand, and was excited to try this cleanser. I'm at the nuisance age of enjoying periodic acne along with mild wrinkles, so I keep looking for solutions for the former that don't exacerbate the latter (dry skin makes the wrinkles look worse, for those not yet familiar with the pattern). This cleanser is not going to stay in my arsenal.

Pros:
1. Only need to use a small amount, which should make the very small bottle last longer
2. Rinses clean, without residue
3. Doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin
4. Doesn't seem to strip my skin, but leaves it feeling clean
5. Doesn't dry my skin to make the wrinkles look worse

Cons:
1. Doesn't do much other than clean. I didn't notice any effect other than the mental one from the ""cooling action"" of the menthol. I got zero benefit from using this other than the ""cleansing"" part.
2. Not suitable for removing makeup. This is definitely a cleanser to be used strictly for a makeup-free face. Even when I used it after removing my makeup (with Neutrogena wipes, which are the best I've found so far), I still needed another cleanser for traces of eye makeup since I'm not putting menthol around my eyes.
3. Doesn't foam. It's more of a watery gel, like inexpensive liquid hand soap. That means it's also kind of runny, so applying it in the shower meant it ran into my eyes if I wasn't careful. Note that this is only because I let it sit on my skin for several seconds to try to get some benefit from the salicylic acid. This approach is NOT suggested on the packaging, so I can't fault Obagi for it. I do wish it had a thicker consistency, though, so the salicylic acid could sit and have time to do something.
4. Expensive. Considering the tiny bottle size and minimal effects (and the need for something else to remove makeup), the price tag seems very high. I've used drug store cleansers that were on par with this one for a fraction of the cost. If I'm spending more, I'd rather invest in Algenist or La Mer cleansers, which don't claim to do anything for acne, but do clean my skin beautifully (including eye makeup).

Overall, I'm sad to say I can't recommend this cleanser.",0
Love the results.  Get compliments everyday.  Especially after having hardly no lashes left after 2 years of eyelash extensions,1
"The shipping came quicker than expected. I like the product, it worked tons better than my old one. heats up really fast, hair stays straight for most of the day. Good, reliable straightener.",1
"a great hair fill in, looks real, just don't last as long. by the next day or two It`s gone.",1
I bought this because I was seeing rolled up dead skin when I went for a massage.  Gross.  I had been using a nylon scrubber but notice I was getting little bumps on the shoulders and upper arms.  This really works.  I use it about 2-3 times a week and the improvement is amazing.  I use it with a mild Aveeno scrub and it works like a charm.  No more old dead skin.,1
"bought this to keep my face hydrated during a 2 wk trip out west to visit our new granddaughter...was not impressed. I really was expecting to be blown away from all they hype of this overpriced product. I wanted to at least feel frou-frou and pampered by it but ummm....put some grapes in water and infuse them a few days and then pour the water from that into a spray bottle, lol. That'd be better than this stuff. Sorry, Caudalie don't impress me.",0
"I ORDERED THIS DIFFUSER TO GO ALONG WITH THE T3 ION GENERATOR HAIR DRYER (FEATHERWEIGHT LUXE 2i) WHICH I ORDERED AT THE SAME TIME, AS SUGGESTED BY THE LINE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HAIRDRYER DESCRIPTION - THE ONE ABOUT OTHERS PURCHASING SUGGESTED ITEMS TO GO ALONG WITH WHAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING.  GREAT I THOUGHT.  ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT THE DIFFUSER DID NOT FIT THAT DRYER!!!
IN ADDITION, THE SUPPLIER TO AMAZON WAS NOT AN AUTHORIZED DEALER OF T3 PRODUCTS!!
BUT AMAZON IS A FIRST-RATE BUSINESS & WHEN I EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM THEY EVENPAID FOR THE SHIPPING COSTS TO RETURN THE ITEM.
WELL DONE AMAZON!!!",0
"Why are spray leave-in conditioners so hard to find? This one is pretty damn good...however I have curly hair and it takes the curl out. Its not that it feels heavy, I think the cuticle is just getting so smoothed out that the curl disappears.",1
Underwhelming,0
I love the smell of this product but it is very sticky and leaves my hair crunchy and stiff.,0
Product was not as described either they changed the scent or this is a FAKE because this does not smell like Kenneth Cole black,0
"Dont not buy it, it is a scam!
listed as ""Ceramide Capsules Daily Youth Restoring Serum"" but it turns out to be the cheap ""Eye Serum"", such misdirecting and false advertising buyer are unacceptable!",0
"This perfune was what my wife wanted to, the provider apart from me i adjubto eu caalago and sample of 2 perfumes that my wife tested and now I'll have to buy some from.",1
Baby smells wonderful. High in price and does not help his dry skin.,1
im sure it's the good product just not the right one for me.,0
Love it,0
Broke after a few uses and doesn't heat up at all. My previous hot tools curling iron lasted for 2 years. Very disappointed in this product.,0
"With the new 'Super Lice' going around we decided it to take any chances!  Not only is tea tree oil a repellant, this shampoo is really going to get you going in the morning. You scalp feel clean and invigorated. This product went well above my expectations.",1
"I've used this product for a little over 1 wk consistently.  Have tried it on wet, damp, and dry hair, all results were the same, disappointing.  It doesn't make your hair shiny or brighter, in fact it made my hair as dull as asphalt at night.
It's ok as a hair styling cream, and has a very light, almost unnoticeable scent.
It's not worth the money tho.
Have used other products with better results.",0
"Mustela makes a big thing about their products being natural and hypoallergenic. Since I have sensitive skin, I always try a dab of any cream on the inside of my arm (where the skin is thin) and wait for a few hours. It only took a few seconds to realize that the Stretch Marks Prevention cream was problematic for me! It made my skin red and irritated, even on the back of my hand where I rubbed the leftover portion when more came out of the tube than I expected. I immediately washed my skin but it stayed red for a while and felt like it was burning.

So what is in this prevention cream? MustelaUSA says ""AQUA/WATER/EAU, DI-C12-13 ALKYL MALATE, ETHYLHEXYL COCOATE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, DICAPRYLYL CARBONATE, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, BUTYLENE GLYCOL, CERA ALBA/BEESWAX/CIRE DABEILLE, LAURETH-23, GALACTOARABINAN, BUTYROSPERMUM PARKII (SHEA) BUTTER, GLYCERYL STEARATE, 1,2-HEXANEDIOL, CETYL ALCOHOL, CETEARYL GLUCOSIDE, GLYCERYL CAPRYLATE, PARFUM (FRAGRANCE), XANTHAN GUM, CETYL PALMITATE, COCOGLYCERIDES, SCLEROTIUM GUM, ZINC GLUCONATE, PENTYLENE GLYCOL, HELIANTHUS ANNUUS (SUNFLOWER) SEED OIL, SOPHORA JAPONICA FRUIT EXTRACT, HYDROLYZED AVOCADO PROTEIN, MALTODEXTRIN, CITRIC ACID, LUPINUS ALBUS SEED EXTRACT, TOCOPHEROL."" (I apologize for the caps but I pasted this from their site.)

None of these are among my usual allergens but many of them I have not heard of.  I have had problems with some fragrances and a few fruit products. Fragrance can be anything so it is hard to judge but it is noticeable as soon as you open the tube. In EWG's Skin Deep Database, fragrance is the ingredient that keeps this product from getting a high rating, along with Laureth-23, which they say can cause irritation and organ system toxicity, and zinc gluconate, which can bioaccumulate and also has organ system toxicity.

The Mustela website claims good results based on a ""Clinical trial conducted on 26 pregnant women who used this product throughout their pregnancy.""  But personally I cannot recommend it. I did not dare to try the second product in the package after the bad experience with the first one. It also contains fragrance.

This set is made in France.",0
It's not the best,0
"I purchased one of these several years ago, and while they aren't mega-bucks, they aren't cheap either. They are supposed to be professional-grade curling irons. I LOVED my last one but after 7 years, it was showing it's age, and I wanted a smaller size.

When I ordered, I saw reviews where people said the finish chipped after just a short time, and I'm thinking to myself ""Are they crazy?"" Well, I can eat those words because right around the 30 days to return, with just moderate use, mine has developed a chip in the finish that pulls at and rips out my hair - I am THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED! I've contacted the seller today to see what my options are and I'm hoping they will do the right thing and return/refund, and take it up with Hot Tools on my behalf. It would be ridiculous not to....so here's hoping.

I am writing this today to say - BELIEVE it! It's not the same product you may have purchased before!",0
Fairly quite. Recommend,1
"Tex Texture Paste is a proprietary pomade of Vaughn Acord, a famed stylist. Tex Texture Paste's clay base gives long lasting control. It has beeswax that provides a moisturising effect. Together, the paste is used to maintain style and impart volume. This is one of those a little goes a long way products. Start with almost dry hair, just the slightest bit damp. Put only a little product on with fingertips, working down from the tips of the hair to the bottom without getting it on the scalp. I initially applied too much which left DHs hair looking greasy and slightly wet. Because it's clay versus water base, it took more than one shampoo to remove all that I'd accidently applied. With his hair finally clean again, we worked together, using a minimal amount. It successfully worked great in his short hair to plump it up into a messy bedhead look that lasted an entire afternoon and evening. For most men, this probably isn't a daily use product; however, when one needs a pomade to create and heavily control a style (weddings, parties, date nights, etc), it would be hard to find anything better.",1
Awesome purchase,1
Overly perfumed. Disappointed in this product that is targeted towards men. Smell doesn't wear off easily which is actually a negative.,0
I have purchased many products from this line. Always I am pleased with their products. This particular cleanser says it effects pigment which it does simply that. I noticed the spots on my face disappearing within 2 uses. It leaves your skin feeling clean. I took away one star because I feel like it doesn't focus on cleansing as much as others. I still feel like I have some residue and buildup on my chin and nose which are difficult areas. To combat that because I like the fact that this almost tones my skin is I use another cleanser (cetaphil) prior to this to get ride of the build up in my pores then finish off with this. Works well for me.,1
"When it arrived, the top of the bottle was broken off and about a quarter was inside the plastic bag the bottle came in. Kinda bummed about it.",0
Not a good buy.  We can't seem to make it work for my husband.  Looks like you spray painted his scalp.  2 thumbs down.,0
"Nice product just like Juice Beauty Natural Moisterizer.  As with both, they are a bit astringent.",1
"What a horrible disappointment, steer clear! I ran out of my usual heat protector spray and was on the hunt for something new. I have coarse wavy hair that has sustained a lot of damage in my quest to be the perfect shade of cool blonde so a heat protector is a must when I straighten or curl my hair. Chi products are supposed to be the best so when I saw this at my local drug store I decided to give it a try. I knew something was terribly wrong from the first spray. My hair turned crispy and stiff, and tangled so badly I had to brush through several times before I could even get my iron on it. I should have washed it out right there and then but I was in a time crunch to get to work so I decided to keep going. I did my whole head and flat ironed as per usual. My hair looked and felt AWFUL. Dry, frizzy flyaways everywhere! Running my fingers through my hair was like running them through straw. It went straight in the trash. I have no idea how anyone can give this product anything more than 1 star, let alone 5!",0
Did not use any after reading reviews about product being green and leaving skin green after application.,0
Love this!  Use regularly in addition to regular sudsing. Will always have handy and wayyy more gentle on natural brushes than rubbing alcohol with minimal residue.,1
It makes your hair smell like towels thats be in the washer to long.  Told customer service about it and really was not helpful at all.  I think it's rancid.,0
excellent  best I ever owned,1
The color that I received is called Bride's Bouquet & basically it is white. The shade I ordered is a pale pink as pictured.,0
"This works at eliminating chronic dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis, hands down. I'm so accustomed to results for any beauty/health treatment being ""subtle"", but after using this a few times, I realized I wasn't scratching scales off my head constantly. My elderly father was plagued by flakes on his head and face and after having switched out his old shampoo, he is literally flake free. Tried prescription Ketoconazole, T-Sal etc and this is the only thing that unquestionably works. That said, I am now struggling with my hair getting stringy/oily within a few hours of washing it. It's as if my oil glands are working excessively to compensate for something and it is frustrating trying to look presentable. I'm sure this has something to do with my hair type already being prone to oiliness but it is the only drawback to an otherwise miraculous product.",1
Nice pallet . Very pigmented . Pleased :),1
"Love this product for my thinning hair. I changed the color this time, to light brown, and it's perfect!",1
Wasnt too crazy about this...def not worth the $. Just put foundation and a touch of chap stick on your lips then apply lipstick. Its really sticky and unnatural feeling as well. Really wish i didn't waste my money on this.,0
"Very little benefit, even with mate shampoo.  It's A 10 Miracle Hair Mask works much better, for me anyway. the",0
Didn't work,0
Didn't work when arrived. Had to return.,0
Very thin and not much coverage at all if you don't wear a foundation over it.  Not sticky or slimy and reduces shine.  Does make a great primer. I will buy this again.,1

"I feel like one tube may last me all year. Proraso produces a richer lather and more volume from similar quantities of Neutrogena, Kiehl's or Taylor of Bond Street shave creams. The richer later seems to help me get a smoother shave than products I've tried before at a lower price. My only complaint is that the sandalwood sent is virtually undetectable. Proraso doesn't mention anything about sandalwood in their information booklet. According to Proraso, the ""red range"" is meant to tame tougher beards and provide their highest protection from razor burn. Some users may prefer this as it is seemingly odorless.",1
"For a decent marcel curling iron this is not a bad choice.

The locking device is easily unlocked so if you plan on locking this look for another product or use electrical tape to permanently lock it.

Mine stopped working after 13 months. I am now looking for another one. I don't think I'll buy Hot Tools products again.

You may have better luck.",0
it works well but you have to be very careful when applying; especially around face; it can get very messy.,1
I have been searching for a great eyelash curler and bought 3 based on reviews. I have tried it many times even using the hairdryer to heat it. It does NOT even bend my lashes in the slightest. I ordered 2 from tweezerman and they are great.,0
Plugged it in the first time and it smelled like something was burning. Stopped working immediately. Never even got to dry my hair with it one time. Big waste of money.,0
Been using this for decades. It's the only high-end lotion worth the price. I just wish the 1 oz. Size wasn't extraordinarily expensive.,1
"I think it smells and feels old, not very happy with it ",0
Arrived on time. Product as expected,1
"I'd never heard of this brand at all, but I got a magazine with a sampler page and wow did it smell good.  That's when I noticed the alligator, and recalled all of the polo shirts I used to have with that gator on them, and then it hit me.  So I went out and bought a small bottle to see if I would like it.

This stuff smells absolutely terrific.  It's the one cologne I've worn recently that's actually gotten comments - every other cologne people have smelled before, so it's nothing new, but this one got people's heads turning.  It's just a great scent, period.  Plan to buy a large bottle for special occasions.",1
"This bun maker works really well!  Because my hair has a tendency to slide out of such hair tools, I use an elastic binder to form a ponytail, and then put another elastic binder at the end of the ponytail (about an inch or two from the end) to hold the loose hair together.  Then I insert the hair into the slit, roll it up tightly, and when it reaches my head, I bend it in a circle to form the bun, which is really easy to do!  I usually will use a few bobby pins to hold it in place, otherwise the weight of the bun causes it to slide downwards throughout the day.  Also, spraying the hair with hairspray helps shorter stray hairs stay put.  Overall, this is the easiest bun maker I've found/used thus far!

For me, the only con is that the foam kind of loses it's even shape with time.  So far, it hasn't caused many issues for me, other than I noticed it has a harder time holding the hair firmly inside and so I end up with more stray hairs falling down/out of the bun maker by the end of the day.",1
Best flat iron I have ever owned. My hair salon uses this one and like the dial so you don't fry your hair. On the box it states what temperatures for your type of hair and obviosuly I have been using temperatures way over what my hair should use and why it has damage. BEST value and you can't go wrong on this one!!,1
"Great product, smells great and leaves hair sleek, shiny and soft",1
"I have red bumps on legs and arms (kp) I've been using the kit for over a month and it's made no difference in the look or feel of my skin. If anything, it just irritates my skin if I use everyday. Not worth it. Prefer OTC products, they do the same job if not better. Very disappointed.",0
"Good quality pure opaque white nail polish.  I think this would look amazing on very long nails (acrylics etc), would be a perfect French tip on long nails as well!  Great to use for nail art/water marbling.",1
"Very good!
No irritation at all.
Quite effective as a deodorant.
Pleasant, subtle scent.",1
"Meh, I was expecting better from the reviews. I don't really like the way this smells. I use it at night though so by morning the smell has dissipated, but still... ""Blow"" is the better product for me (I have fine-ish hair that basically starts getting oily within hours of washing it)  but I don't love the way that product dispenses the powder. Could someone please make a decent dry shampoo?",0
"I'm a longtime safety razor user (Merkur classic 37c) who recently bought this slant-edged model, hoping that its greater aggressiveness would enable me to skip a day of shaving once in awhile. As others have noted, this is a fine product (as with all Merkurs) and it produces a very smooth shave. HOWEVER, unless handled very lightly and very carefully (slowly), it will nick the heck out of your skin. I'm experienced with these things, but I've had a faceful of cuts on too many occasions to keep using it. My blades are Kia, which I swear by, but they turned into machete blades when inserted into the Merkur 37c. Maybe men with heavier beards and more leathery skin will find this the perfect safety razor. You can't ask for a closer shave. But for me, it's just too close for comfort.",0
Very nice scent. The only negative is the price.,1
A little bit oily for me....,1
"I have a neatly trimmed goatee that I've worn for years. Was an old Norelco devotee until they started putting in more plastic and less quality. This is the first stubble trimmer I've found in years that really does a fantastic job without leaving my face feeling raw. Cuts really evenly, sharp blades, easy to use, doesn't pull my hairs. Most importantly I don't feel like I've just rubbed sandpaper all over my face after a trim like I did with Norelco or Remingtons and their crappy plastic combs that feel like little knives.

Bought a second one just to have handy in case they stop making them.... don't want to be stuck without one and hunting for so many years like I did before this one. I've probably gone through five different models in four years and always been disappointed. This one is the best out there!",1
The smell is awful,0
Love this stuff,1
"It's a very heavy scent and strong.  Personally when my guy wears it I find it overpowering in the bad way...the kind you don't really want to be in an elevator with either.  And it lasts.... (this is normally a good thing...unless you don't like it, haha)

To me, it smells older too...it's the kind of scent I'm more used to smelling around men in 40 and above.  I'm not sure I associate this with younger men as much.

It's a night time scent too I think - more date night than office, but only if your date likes it because as I said I kind of do not.

Many of their other scents are much fresher and less heavy.  To each their own, but this was not my favorite.",0
The product is beautiful on although I'm EXTREMELY disappointed with the seller.  I received the blush and when I opened it it was in pieces and not useable at all!  I would purchase this but NOT from this seller!,0
Great product !!!,1
A wonderful hair care product for sensitive scalps. No fragrance.,1
"This stuff is definitely more expensive than drugstore powder, but each purchase lasts about 6 months for me, the color is great, and it gives a nice, smooth finish over a light foundation without looking overdone.",1
"Okay well my mom bought me this curling iron and it came a day before Christmas, which was cool because I thought ""sweet i can curl my hair for christmas!"" I have thickish hair, about 4 inches past my shoulders more or less, and its naturally wavy and sort of gets frizzy after a shower. I figured I could use this curling iron to shape up my waves after a shower so they look polished and sleek. Well unfortunately this was absolutely NOT what I was expecting. When I tried curling my hair I had to turn it up waaay high because anything lower than about 360 just made my hair straight with a rlly ugly flip at the end. So i realized i had to hold this thing to my head for at least a minute if not more to get a curl. And another thing - the curl doesn't look good! It gets a crimp mark where the curl begins on your head, and its shapen all wrong and tight-looking.  Not to mention it gets real boring sitting there holding this monster 5 pound piece of metal-ceramic whatever waiting for a curl that burns the side of your neck and looks like some uptight rope attatched to your head. This thing can barely even straighten right, which is pretty sad. I don't know if the other reviewers just got lucky with theirs or I just got the malfunctioned one but I wouldn't recommend this curling iron to my worst enemy. I've tried using this multiple times and even my friends have tried but it is not working, it didn't work for them either. Except my one friend who got her bangs to look real nice with it, I'm very disappointed with the outcome.",0
Great neutral pink blush that goes on nicely and really lasts! A bit pricey but worth it!,1
"it's fake, don't buy it",0
Super expensive but works like nothing else.,1
"Hey Jennifer. Love this product. So hydrating and cooling. Worth every penny. Below is a breakdown of the contents of this product to make this easy for you Amy.
""Ingredients-Pure, Natural evian Mineral Water: Propelled by safe nitrogen (the air we breathe is 80 percent nitrogen) with a neutral 7.2 pH.""
TRANSLATION:
""Ingredient-Only Water.  That's right Nancy, Water is naturally occurring. So organic. Wow.  Bet this water is even gluten free too!  Gathered from the process used to gather water.  Fun fact: the air on earth mostly consists of Nitrogen.  Samantha, they even use ""safe"" nitrogen, as is used for any propellant spray.  GENIUS!  Opposed to using DANGEROUS/UNSAFE nitrogen; just kidding Nitrogen is Nitrogen Janet! Oh, and like ALL water, THIS Water has a neutral pH level.  That's right Nancy, this is some grade ! VEGAN WATER.""

This water is GMO free.  Dairy free too Cassie.  Vegetarian AND Vegan.  Hypo-allergenic af Jackie.  Free of pesticides.  And made with pure H20.  Assembly is very simple and easy to follow, even you can do it Meg.  MUCH more satisfying than spraying water on your face from a different bottle. YAS BIATCH.",0
"I was sent a sample of this from DooBop and fell in love with it immediately. This moisturizer has the right amount of moisture and the smell is expensive, just like the moisturizer. I hope they never stop making this stuff.",1
"I have been using MARVIS for a while now, i use it with other commercial whitening toothpaste. I usually use the whitening toothpaste at night once a day, but the rest of the day i use MARVIS for its powerful yet authentic taste.

The only downside to it is the price! i find $9-$11 very expensive for toothpaste.

If you can spare $10 for a toothpaste, go for it! if you're skeptical, give it a try. You will love it, especially if you like Cinnamon!",1
I have used product for three weeks and had a bad breakout after use that I thought would go away with use but just got worse. Was using the glysal from the dermatologist which worked great.,0
"I agree with other reviewers concerning how little is in here given the price.  In addition, I don't notice any coverage - I spray it on but see absolutely no difference in my root color.  I wouldn't even know that it had color to it except that it did rub off some brown onto a white silk shirt that I took off over my head.  Do not recommend.",0
Love this lip stain. Does not dry out my lips and lasts a very long time! I forget I have it on! I'm going to get some more in other colors.,1
"My hair dresser uses this brand and I was in the market for a new curling iron, so I decided to give it a try. Gets nice and hot, and I think if I had the patience to perfect my curling method, I would like it better, but I continue to prefer using my wand.",1
I love this two part diffuser. I have very curly hair and this works great with no frizz.,1
"The color is so pale, even after applying two coats, it was barely noticeable.  I own approximately 23 OPI nail colors and up until the purchase of Samoan Sand, I have found each of them to be exactly what I expected.  I purchase OPI as it wears extremely well, but not in this case.",0
"Fake product. I ordered 2, and it's completely different than all the others (same product) I've ever had. Different feel, and smell.",0
This had absolutely no color no matter how many times I used it. I went back to my Sun Labs and Fake Bake lotion and spray.,0
This does not cover roots well and it gets on the scalp. It's like trying to apply powder makeup to your root and it shows up on the scalp. Not impressed! Disappointed!,0
"It is nice and works well, but I have fine hair and it seem to make it on the frizzy side.
I did manage to get it tangled once.",1
"I'm really disappointed in this product .  I guess I didn't read enough reviews.  This is a POWDER base.  It's very dry, my skin is dry-ish, but not oily at all!  I even tried moisturizer first, but it still caked.  Oh well...i suppose it's good for others, but not me :(.",0
Does everything it states it will do.,1
"Unfortunately this iron just did not work for me. I gave it my best shot and I tried to work with it, but to no avail. The metal is very cheap and it consistantly snags the hair. The hair doesnt pull through the iron smoothly and it leaves heavy marks on the hair from the clamp. Ive been working in the salon for almost 10 years and Ive had irons I don't love, but I could still work with them. This is going in the trash.",0
"Oh well, should have known better. Smells good, feels good but no visible changes after applying daily for a month",0
Doesn't work like others I've tried.,0
Love it,1
Love the smell! Arrived on time!,1
It's less expensive on the actual site.,0
Lovely smell but no noticeable color.,1
"I didn't care for the scent. 2 stars because it's a nice shaving cream. Other reviews said they liked the fragrance and I purchased. My 9 yr old daughter summed it up perfectly. ""Dad... you smell like a doctor office.""",0
Helps to detangle my long hair and gives lustrous shine. But doesn't do much on ends of hair that's dry slightly frizzy.,1
"I was so excited to find rollers that were supposed to nicely curl my thick, 18 inch hair. Imagine my disappointment when I got this set of subpar hot rollers. The set doesn't have any indication of when the rollers are hot enough. I had them warming for nearly an hour; which was longer than my hair maintained the curls. These were promptly returnes.",0
Bottle was broken.,1
This iron gets hot really fast and curls beautifully. I only wish that it had an automatic off mechanism.  I have left this iron on several times for several hours.,1
"The Dermablend went on smoothly and covered fairly well. The color was just right for my medium-olive toned skin. It didn't quite cover up an age spot I've had for years, but it did lighten up pretty well. The makeup didn't bother my dry skin, nor did it have an aroma. The only thing negative is the price. I suppose $37 (at the time of this review) may not be much for makeup for some women, but it's a bit pricey in my eyes. I do like the fact that it's SPF 25. That's a nice addition.",1
This is the wrong product that I thought I was ordering.... I really wanted the Bosley Revive that often sells with the shampoo and conditioner.... I need to reduce hair loss....not glue what's left to my sconce.... HMMM!,0
Did nothing. An absolute disappointment and a waste of money.,0
They actually sent me hot curlers instead when I ordered this curling iron expecting to get it. i was a little dissapointed when i recieved the curlers but don't want to go the the hassel of shipping it back and i will just keep my wrong item...,0
"Like many others, I also received what I suspect to be fake Strivectin; it was so different from the other 2 tubes that I had used. The consistancy, color, and scent were all different. When I very closely compared the tubes, they were different too, with small variations in the words, pink stripes, etc. and yes, it was more drying, not as creamy and just did not feel as nice. What made me suspicious though was that when it arrived, there was no box, no brochure like the previous tubes.

Soooo....I called Strivectin. Weeks ago I might add. I began by asking if they had any information on any possible fake products being sold. I was told to always buy the products from an authorized distributor (if it's being offered for sale, how am I suppose to know if it's an authorized distributor and there was no answer for that question). I gave the rude and unhelpful lady the code from the tube and asked her if she could check to make sure it was an authentic code number at least. She took the number and said she would call me back (gave her my name and phone number). Days later I called them again and asked why I hadn't received a return call. The lady I spoke to that time was at least pleasant. She took my information again and while on the phone she said she was e-mailing another department to get the answer expedited for me and I should have a call back the following day. It has since been 3 weeks. I know ED said that he got all kinds of information from them. I guess I spoke to the wrong folks there!  If the formula has changed and this is what it will be from now on, JUST SAY SO STRIVECTIN. Tell all of us who call!! If it will be sold as just a plain tube without a box and brochure then tell us that too!! As it is, we don't know what we have. FAKE OR AUTHENTIC??? They should at least know their own product codes. I WOULD LIKE AN ANSWER FROM THEM. AFTER ALL, CUSTOMERS AT LEAST DESERVE ANSWERS. WE ARE THE ONES KEEPING THEM IN BUSINESS, so I expect a return call as promised.",0
Beautiful palette! I use this with my UD primer potion and it last all day. The formula is so soft and gives great color payoff. Great colors!,1
"Doesn't work as well as the Got2b texture powder that I can no longer find anywhere.  I thought this product would be better because of the brand, but I don't like it.",0
Great aroma for the mature woman.  I love it.  Only need to mist a little bit and it lasts.,1
I've been using this product for years & love it!,1
"I have used this product very happily for years (originally recommended by my dermatologist). However, I recently purchased a bottle (in the new grey tube packaging) from STERLING BUYS and after one use, my skin was BURNED and inflamed like I have never experienced before in my life. It took half a day for the painful, raw redness to subside and I broke out horribly the next day. There was no advertised change to the product formulation but I noted that at least one additional customer had experienced something similar (after having used it without incident for years). When I reported this problem to STERLING BUYS they refused a refund and did not seem at all concerned with the clear SAFETY CONCERNS of its customers. Buy this product with CAUTION, especially from STERLING BUYS. I have reported this to Amazon and to Glycolix Elite directly. Very disappointed as I was a happy user of Glycolix Elite products for years until this issue.",0
"Tried this out due to all the good reviews. I have dark hair and this DOES leave a slight powdery residue. It smells really nice but personally did not work as well as another brand I've tried before. Halfway through the day my hair felt like it had buildup and when running my fingers through it, I'd get the powdery stuff on my hands.",0
"I like this line of shaving product, but the metal tube started leaking after the second use.  I had to squeeze all of it out into a tupperware container.  It was such a mess that I'm going back to the solid version.  This formula is great though.  The two shaves that I got before the tubing fiasco were pretty decent.",0
The brush stopped spinning after two days. I really loved it for the first day.,0
"This mascara is both awesome and mediocre I am a doctor and sometimes work 30-hour shifts and I really can't wear normal mascara because I end up looking like a raccoon after about 10 hours and have no mascara left on my actual lashes. This mascara is great because it actually stays on for 30 hours and washed off pretty easily. That said, it doesn't really make my lashes as long as regular mascara. I had a sample that seemed to work better, maybe it was a little older and thicker. I like it enough I bought the full size and it's pretty thin and just makes your lashes darker and not really longer or thicker.

I think this is a great product if you have long, full lashes and just want to darken them or if you work long hours. I wear my regular mascara when I work normal shifts.

I haven't been using it long enough to see whether it makes my lashes fall out, but I guess I could see how that might happen.",1
Non-static? I don't think so! I ran this brush through my hair and the result was my hair being plastered to my head by static.,0
"I use this every night, its amazing, gets mascara off with one or two swipes!! In love!!",1
I love the scent but it doesn't last long - therefore the 4 stars. I wish it would last a little longer.,1
"Not sure if I got a bad batch,  but this last purchase is different.  It's greasy to the point I get break outs.  I use this product for long time and it's great,  however something is different with this last purchase.",0
"The Freeze and Shine Finishing Spray I received from this seller does not have the same consistency or hold as all previous purchases of this product from other places.  In fact, I think it may have been watered down.  :(",0
too glosy,0
"This thing didn't make my hair feel smooth or nice. It made my hair tangled and feel unconditioned. It was not smoothing at all. The first time I tried it, it made my hair feel gross. I thought that I may have put too much on. The second time I used it, I put on about a quarter size but the result was still the same. Now, I have this huge bottle of useless ""conditioner"" that I wasted my money on.",0
Not exactly what I expected. But an ok product.,0
Very dry and ugly in appearance.  Chalky,0
The color looks weirdly dirtier than the image.,1
Love the products!!,1
"I have sensitive skin that tends to be oily. I usually can't wear an SPF face cream because they make my skin more oily and then I get break outs, but this cream kept my face hydrated without becoming oily. I think it may be because it contains Zinc. It really evens out my skin tone and I have much less redness on my cheeks and nose. I love that it's very light weight and that it has almost no smell. I can't stand creams with a heavy scent, that is what I have perfume for. The scent is unnecessary and only serves as an irritant to my sensitive skin.  I've tried a lot of SPF face creams and this really has worked the best for me. It's a little pricey, but I find I don't need to use very much at all so this small bottle will last a long while and in the end I'll save money not having to keep trying a bunch of creams that don't work.",1
I love this product however the last two shipments came with damage to product container. Product had leaked into shipping container.,1
"I use this everyday, I have curly hair and it works great.",1
Love how it makes my hair feel.,1
"I found this product to be nothing more than a tinted polish.  Does not function as a ""stickey"" base coat to provide additional adherence and protection to your polish.  I completed a traditional manicure and 2 days later the tips were chipping.  I would not purchase again.",0
you will notice the effect immoderately after you use it. Use it right after a hot shower. I love it,1
"Go to highlighter, even though its advertised as an eyeshadow. It's gorgeous as both, but a bit more shimmery than I originally thought it would be. The shimmer is beautiful and subtle, however, I'm just more of a natural style gal.",1
"be careful, this dryer is so hot it will burn your hair if you leave it in one spot too longwhich is really just seconds.  Ive learned to run it for the most part on medium setting unless Im holding the dryer way far away from my head.  Who knew, I thought the hotter the faster and better to style my hair????  It is lightweight and easy to hold, and I have carpal tunnel in both hands and golfer tennis elbow in right elbow, so the weight was a big factor for me choosing a hair dryer.  I haven't really noticed it being less frizzy due to nano, ionic technology, maybe that is something that comes with doing my hair properly?  Im using this as I did my old dryer, but on medium setting.  If there is another way Im supposed to use this please let me know!!!
I did NOT receive this product in exchange for my review
Before I write a review i usually let the item sit out on the table until Im ready to take it for a test drive  Then I run it through a rigorous set of tests ;)
Does it look good? feel?
How does it compare with...?
Can I do anything else with it?
Does it do what it says it does?
Would I change anything?
Anything else Id like to see as an additional feature
  And then.
I sit down and write my review.  It usually takes me 2+ hours to write--get it on the screen, organized, edited, cut read, re-read, re-editedyou get it...before its ready to be posted.  So, if you are reading this review some thought has been put into it.  I hope this helps you to make an educated decision on your next purchase, and if you have any questions leave it in my comments and Ill get back to youReally :
If you find this review helpful, please let me know so I can write better reviews.l",1
so sticky and unmoldable once in hair that it was hard to use.,0
"Waiting to get my lab results, to see how it's working. In other words, my cholesterol results",1
"My wife tried this this out - it feels great, although a little more thin than we're used to.  It's absorbed quickly and feels great, with a great smell.  (Maybe some hints of truffle, but it really works!)

The only complaint is that it doesn't have sunscreen.  If that's OK with you, then no complaints, but if you're looking for a daily sunscreen, I'd personally rather include it in moisturizer so you don't need to use two products.",1
"What a joke! This iron does NOT straighten my wavy hair AT ALL, and smells horrible (like chemicals) heated up.",0
"This stuff is sooo great. This three-pack set gives you the creme de la creme in men's skincare. The shampoo is wonderful and actually prevent hair loss. The body wash is my favorite...its smells awesome. The after shave is fantastic...soothing and refreshing. I suggest this pack for those who've never used Billy Jealousy or those loyal followers such as myself...this is also a great was for someone to get introduced to Billy Jealousy, this has all the essentials. You will not be displeased, in fact you'll be in awe...you'll be compelled to tell everyone, this also makes a great gift. Billy Jealousy is the absolute best and I've used all upscale lines from department stores, Sephora, and spas...and this stuff is the best!",1
This is my favorite tinted mineral sunscreen.  I rotate between three brands and this is my go too.  Spreads well and creamy.,1
Pump did not work. Couldn't get the top off to even use it that way. Had to send it back.,0
great set need to add pre-whitening rinse for it to work properly,1
good stuff - not greasy or stiff - works great for adding texture and fullness,1
Doesn't work for dryer by same company--just keeps popping off. Poor design.,0
Excellent products will be buying more.,1
"Smells great, feels great. Not sure if it's supposed to improve anything - didn't see any improvements, but its a great mid-day spray to freshen up.",1
"Just not right for me!  Do not like the way it ""goes on"" .  Did not feel like it looked natural.",0
Excellent Product!  It preforms exactly as promised. Would highly recommend.,1
"I ordered this to replace a blinc Heated Lash Curler I have had for a few years and use daily. I wish I hadn't wasted my money. The new curler is defective and feels slightly larger than my old one. The heating element has a space in it and does not heat up properly. I tried 3 different batteries and it just does not heat up, it only gets slightly warm (because the heating element has the gap in it I previously mentioned.) I cannot return it because by the time I decided to open it the return period was over.  I am still using my old one, which still works.",0
"After trying many facials cleansers, this will be my go-to. I have sensitive, dry skin except in the summer (living in Florida) when my face is constantly oily. At the end of the day or if I don't have time to fully wash my face, this works great. I don't feel dry, it cleans well and removes eye make-up like a harm without leaving behind any oily residue. I would highly recommend!",1
I bought this product because I have intolerant dehydrated skin. It didn't break me out so thats good BUT I used it 2-3 times today and my skin feels even more dehydrated (just a little more) than usual. I have only used it today so I will update after further use if there is a change :(,0
I received my bottles today and both were spoiled! The contents in each bottle was yellow and smelled bad. Called Amazon promptly and are returning this purchase. I should've know that this would happen since the price was too good to be true.,0
"Not sure why everyone seems to love this iron. I did like the temperature dial, and it seemed to heat evenly and quickly- but there were some serious design flaws. The barrel seems shorter than the tapered irons I have used in the past, which mean that I had to curl the top section, then the bottom section of each piece of hair. The taper is also almost non-existant. The narrow end is maybe a few milimeters smaller than the wide end. The curl did not hold well in my hair. Not a fan.",0
didnt do anything for me,0
Purchased my 1 1/2 inch barrel Rusk curling iron and I loved it until 11 months later the spring broke.  Found purchase price on my statement but can't use as proof of purchase according the the Rusk customer service rep.  since it only appears as Amazon Marketplace on my statement without an item description.  Amazon customer service couldn't find the transaction on my account and therefore I have no recourse.  Very expensive curling iron for less than a year of usage.,0
"I'd heard about this on a FB group as a terrific product for taking care of your lips during those harsh winter months. Oh My Gosh! its about 12.00 and worth every penny. In the winter my upper lip peels until it bleeds. I put this on, A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!.... I put this on every night and my lips have never, ever been better. This tube has lasted almost a whole year, with daily usage. If you have dry peeling lips, exfoliate them one or twice a week with a homemade brew of olive oil, sugar and a tooth brush and use this emollient lubricant gold once a day and your lips will be as kissable as a baby's.....cheek",1
"I think this is a fake.  Has a bad smell, not normal Oribe.",0
Too strong for my sensitive skin. My face was red and enflamed for days after I used it. Careful out there!,0
"First off, the color is gorgeous! A little darker than I thought, but beautiful nonetheless. It also lasts quite a while without top coat. I used two coats and it lasted over a week with very little chipping. I'm sure it would last longer if you used a base coat and a top coat, but I got lazy and didn't have any on hand. It lasted longer than my Essie polish. Would buy again",1
"The product is fantastic but the shipping from this particular seller took over a week.
I've been using Toppik for over 3 years now and it's my life saver. I'm a female in her 30s with thinning hair at the top of the head. The key to this product looking natural is not simply shake it on top of your hair but to lift a strand at a time and add a small amount of Toppik at the root line, then lift the next strand and so on. I finish it off with a light coat of hair spray and it lasts until my next wash (3-4 days)",1
Not the same one I bought one from the local store,0
"Cheaply made with chrome plated cast metal, but shaves very well.",1
"I have used this same shampoo for years, but this is the first time I have ordered it from Amazon. Never again! The shampoo had a terrible Oder. So bad I couldn't use it. I know what shampoo 3 is suppose to smell like, and this smell wasn't normal.  I will get it from my beauty shop from now on.  Normally this shampoo has a great smell.",0
"This is a big bottle, a BIG bottle. But it works (even if it makes your baby smell a bit like a granny). Our little one had pretty severe baby acne and it cleared it up within two weeks. We still use it on his face to keep him moisturized and clean. It is great for dry skin and trouble skin alike!",1
I bought this tool as I have a larger one and it works like a charm.  This one however does not stay hot and the light flashes from on to off consistently.  I unfortunately threw out the box and I am unable to return the tool.  Beware of a good thing...NOT!!!!!,0
"This is a great slant razor, if you're on the fence about buying it go ahead and purchase with confidence. I find it to be very mild, but like any razor you can't be careless. I've had this for 2 days and have had the best shaves I can remember. It's a Merkur so the quality is there, although I've read some reviews saying the quality control has been a issue on some. I think this would be a excellent addition for any wet shaver. I think this would also be a great model for a new shaver to transition to after they have their technique down. A mild razor but extremely effective. Highly recommend this for those wishing to buy a slant.",1
"THIS PRODUCT SEEM TO ME IS FEAKE
I USE BEFORE AND I LIKE BUD THIS ONE WAS DEFERENT",0
Looks good drys fast. Then peels off in a few days.,0
Great product ... I wish it didn't cost so much!,1
"Clearly the best antioxidant face cream with SPF in it!  I have been using this product for more than ten years .  It is non greasy, absorbs into skin, perfect for under your foundation.  Keeps skin looking healthy with a rosy glow!",1
I don't like it .I lost too much hair since I used it,0
"Can't believe AMAZON is selling this stuff, it must come directly from CHINA!!  Smells different, has a different color, and it suds up my hair.  The real Moroccanoil Hydrating Mask is awesome, I wish Amazon would back their products, offer a return, give a customer service phone number etc.  If I could rate this Imitation product zero starts I would.  Again this is an impostor, the original stuff is awesome, Amazon is selling black market junk.....stay away!",0
"As odd as it may sound, this hair product has greatly improved my self esteem.  Many times I noticed people looking at my very thin hair instead of my eyes while we were conversing.  Toppik has been a dream product -  it blends in with my hair perfectly and doesn't fall out or rub off either.  It also doesn't not make a mess in the room, i.e.  no thin layer of black dust anywhere.  When I am engaged in a conversation with people, they are no longer staring at my ""bald spot.""",1
"The glass container the serum is in, was cracked when I received it. The pumper did not work properly either. I figured it must have happened during shipping. Within 2 weeks the serum leaked out of the crack, & I was not able to use the product as I wanted/needed to.",0
"I thought I would like it. I liked how my skin felt when using it but then after about 3 days of use, my face started breaking out which it does very rarely.  This is the only thing I changed in my normal routine so I am attributing my reaction to this product and have quit using it.",0
"This Burberry for Men Eau de Toilette isn't overpowering at all.  There's a subtle scent, slightly woodsy and citrusy.  It's refreshing and seems like it would work well both for summer when scents are strong and in the winter when a subtle scent is preferred.

Though it's a scent for men, I like it enough that I'd be willing to wear it once in a while, too.",1
"It works for straight razor shaving, not so well with regular shavers aka ones with multiple blades. Very thick application unless you water it down. Thick when scraped off skin going down sink.",0
This Shampoo is gentle and easy on colored hair. It smells good too.,1
"My mother purchased this for herself and ended up deciding to gift it to me. I honestly didn't feel like anything amazing or life-changing was going on when I was using it. I had it in my shower and the next day there was already a small spot of mold on the silicone. I was confused. I just sort of wiped it away and went on with my shower. I took a 4 day vacation recently and came back and now it's covered in mold. I have a very large master bathroom with good air circulation, so it's not like it was just sitting in steam all day ... so I'm not sure why this was happening, but it's gross and I'm over it.",0
"Great on my straight, fine blonde hair and the curls stay!",1
"Works. Is it painful, well ... sorta. The reality of this particular skin treatment is that it does cause pain when you use it. The good news is that it does work to help create better looking skin. I used it for about 2 weeks on some wrinkles on my face and they definitely improved.  The device is super easy to use and charge, and the set up is really nice. The stand is great, it has a great firm hold on the ""wand"" and it looks nice in the bathroom.

The bad news is that it hurts. I think the better way to describe it is between a sting and a sharp burn. But it isn't overwhelming and you can certainly handle it. Now if you are super sensitive to pain and are not really into clearing some skin issues up, then you will not be motivated to do it. But if you are motivated and want results, then you will be bale to easily handle the sting and you will be happy with what results.

Also, be aware that this is not the equivalent of a face lift. This seems to work best on smaller areas.",1
"No product seal. In holding it up to the light, it's easy to see that at least 1/3 of the product is missing.",0
this product was highly recommended and it really works well for me. Nice!,1
"I had ordered a similar product a few years ago and was very happy with the socks.  When I went to reorder this product a new seller showed up.  The socks still work great!  I was a little disappointed with the gloves but could be because my hands seem to always be in water, so could be that the softening affect wears off more quickly.  I'll probably just order the socks in the future.",1
"I like the product because I used to use it before.
But the expiration date is March 2013.
I bought this January 2013 and I think the expiration date should be at least 1 year.
Especially for sensitive skin, expiration date does matter.
I am very disappointed.",0
runs out kind of quickly but good product overall,1
would not buy it again.,0
"This stuff stinks of patchouli. I can't really say if it works like they say it does because I only used it once and immediately regretted putting it on my face.  My beard did feel a little softer after I put it on, but any benefit from using this stuff is not worth having the stench of a head shop stuck to my face. I'm not sure what they think a bearded man should smell like in Holland, where this stuff is made, but I don't think many Viking Lumberjacks want to smell like they've been hanging out at a jam band festival. I had to crank Slayer's Raining Blood up to 11 and stick my face in the speaker to get the dirty hippie smell off my face. I guess I should have known that something called Mousse A Barbe wasn't going to be what my Grizzly Adams wanted.",0
I was very disappointed in this product. It didn't do what a dry shampoo is supposed to do. Very strong smell also.,0
Love the color.  Very summerish. It's a great polish.  And the price was great. Less money than I have seen it at any store  The quality is great too. They use it at all the nail salons,1
Great product.,1
Love this product. Leaves my lips super soft and it is super gentle. Perfect for before doing your make up to prevent cracked lips.,1
i have very dry skin and this was too thick and greasy for me. it made my face look like an oil slick and has an extremely unpleasant smell to it.,0
This product actually made me breakout ....hello this way sucked . Looked on cosdna.com and u can find out which products are good for your skin or not before you buy them. Wish i knew before i bought this junk.,0
Color doesnt look like this at all!!!,0
"Wow. I never thought I would be so in love with TOOTHPASTE of all things, but this toothpaste is lifechanging. The flavor is amazing, and it makes my teeth look great. I swear the flavor lingers for a few hours. It isn't overly minty, or overly gingery. It's perfect.

I can never go back to other toothpastes. This one is so worth the 10$.",1
This is not the same quality product I'm used to.  The color and smell is off and if I use it more then two night in a row my skin turns red and itchy.  I question how it was stored and for how long.  When I got this from a different seller it was the same as when I purchased from the professional who does my facials.  I will not purchase from this seller ever again.,0
"If you live in Colorado or Nevada, you know your fingers, hands and feet tend to dry and crack from the ultra-dry climate. This shea butter based cream from L'Occitane is great for repair and prevention. The aroma is quite subdued - traces of shea butter - and it works in very well, minimizing post-application greasy fingers. This is more important for a guy, as the gals I know always stay on top of moisturizing and appear less put off by scent or the appearance of sheen. A little goes a long way, which offsets L'Occitane's priciness.",1
"This shampoo does thicken my hair some.  It feels nice and smooth, not dry like some other volumizing shampoos.  However, with every shampoo that I try the first time, I wash my hair in a big white plastic bowl so I can see if it causes any hair loss or color loss from my hair dye.  I had hoped it would work for me as it is very difficult to find a shampoo that doesn't cause hair loss or hair color and at the same time, thickens my hair.
Unfortunately, at the first try, this shampoo caused hair loss and some hair color was washed off also, so I had to return it.
Back to my Burt's Bee Baby Shampoo Original, which doesn't cause any hair loss or the loss of hair color, but if there is another one that does all this plus thickens my hair, I would love to try.",0
doesn't work well.,0
this stuff is like Magic my hair looks better than it ever has!  this stuff makes dry straw hair look healthy and moisturized.,1
I have been curling my hair for 20 something years with many difference kinds of curling irons but never have I ever burned myself 3 times  the first time I used an iron. The iron does not have the normal piece at the end where you can place your fingers to help hold the iron-it sucks. If I didn't toss out the packaging I would return this iron.,0
"My skin is a light neutral olive and I usually wear medium makeup when not tan.  Though in general companies are getting better about providing mediums in different undertones, a lot do not and are simply too yellow. This medium is a nice neutral, if not a little lighter than anticipated but it blends well and looks natural. The coverage is on the light side so I'm definitely going to wear it on good skin days with concealer.",1
wives hair fell out..she dumped it,0
Too costly for a comb,1
The perfect nude polish. Must have for everyone!,1
I looked forward to using this product.  Used it and couldn't get past the overly-scented perfumey smell.  Couldnt use because of this.,0
"Love the color, it looks great against the color of my skin. Easy to apply, and a non-drying matte liquid lippy.",1
I have been using this face cream for years and notice a remarkable difference in how much better my skin feels. I live in a small town and have a hard time finding a store that carries it. When I am out of Strivectin I can hardly stand it.,1
"Upon opening my package, the product was covered completely in shampoo. It seems like half the shampoo had spilled out.",0
"I loved the product but for the size of the bottle for what i paid for it, not worth it",0
I've been using Vichy products for some years now.  I like this serum for my type of skin.  The product arrived in about a week from when I ordered it from Greece.  Thank you!,1
"I was amazed that it worked my daughter has severs hair loss you can see her scalp, , she is in her early 20's and that was real bad feeling for her so when I got her this product and I used it on her it was like a miracle.",1
These products are great but the downside is that the smell is quite odd! I put this on st night once in a while but the drying cream smells awful! Its no miracle product but it does its job!,1
"I buy this every year,best product out there for a natural tanned look. No streaking or blotches, I don't have to reapply for over 2 weeks.",1
"BEWARE !!!  This is not the original product.  My daughter uses the correct product and gets it from a medical spa.  I ordered this thinking it was the same product.  After trying to use this product and having reactions (I took a break and tried using it several times), I told my daughter she could have this product.  She brought it home and checked the ingredients with the container she purchased from a medical spa.  NONE of the ingredients were the same.  She threw this product in the trash.",0
"Giving to two stars because I think if it absorbed I would love it.

In its defense i do have oily skin (though this was suggested to me for the protection benefits). It doesn't smell bad and the texture is awesome. But my oily skin refuses to absorb it so it leaves me with a nice sheen - which by the way isn't actually super greasy which is awesome. Not the end of the world in a Boston winter BUT come summer this will have to go.

Probably great for comb/dry skin!",0
Great East to use product.,1
"My favorite sunscreen for the face!  Dries matte, doesn't stink like normally sunscreen, and doesn't leave that greasy feeling.  The mineral sunscreens were recommended by the dermatologist.  This is the un-tinted version.  If you're fair-skinned, I find this to be a better option.  The tinted is a little dark.",1
It has been very effective in reducing my lower back pains and stiffness for about 15 years.,1
Great color and coverage!!!,1
"Bought this to address body areas that needed some tightening.  It does seem to offer some improvement.  Have only done a few  applications so far, but will probably buy again",1
"Actually amazing. So much product for reasonable price. Keeps skin hydrated but doesn't leave a ""film"" or leave ur skin ""tackey"". Good before bed, before makeup, on top of makeup, and with no make up, Will definitly be ordering more.",1
I think this is working - to make my hair at least appear thicker!  Guess time will tell,1
"Just received this curling iron and it appears to have been used previously. It smells like chemicals, it's rusted under the handle at the spring, the barrel has black spots all over it, also finger prints,  and a layer of caked on stuff that I can't readily identify.",0
"Works good, not noisy, regular cutting, safe (can not cut yourself). nice trimmer but not easy to reach nose area when comb on.",1
We love this perfume at our house and have worn it for years. So glad to be able to purchase on line.,1
"I have really dry hands from moving from a very humid climate to a very arid one. Used this product for a little over a week, every day, multiple times a day. Didn't get any ongoing improvement in between putting it on, sometimes 6 or 8 times a day. Also had a pretty strong odor that I didn't like. Also, for a product that claims to be non-greasy, it was pretty greasy. Not as much as other products, but I wouldn't describe it as non-greasy.",0
"This stuff worked PHENOMENALLY the first month or so I had it. I thought my problems were finally solved. After continued use for a few months, the effectiveness went down considerably. I'm not sure why this is, but it happened. It's definitely worth trying, however.",1
"After reading other reviews and seeing the price, I was expected to be blown away with this new hairdryer.  After using it for a couple of months now, I like it... but love it?  I guess not.  I expected to be totally raving about this thing.  I have never paid so much for a hairdryer. It dries my hair, is easy to use and is ligher than other dryers.  That is all I will say.",1
"I'm still not sure if you're supposed to spray on before or after straightening, but doing it before and after seems to work.  I saw some people didn't like the smell, but I found the smell to not be bad at all, just smells like a hair product like you would smell in the salon.  It does make hair shinier. I hold a few inches away from my head and spray real quick cause if you spray too much too close it does seem like it could make hair look greasy. I like it works great!",1
I am utterly disappointed with this product. My $1 shaving cream from walmart provided better prep for my neck than this...,0
"This product is okay, it works fine, but mine had HAIR in it when i opened it up. so taht was kind of odd. it wasn't sealed or anything too. So, i probably won't be ordering from them anymore.",0
"I understand many people might have benefit from utilizing this product for their hair loss on their scalp, which I initially tried only to be disappointed.  I tried using it to ""advance"" my hairline a bit by placing the ""hair fibers"" in front of my hairline in the temporal region.  I then tried using it to fill in my beard as it is a little patchy in some areas.  The trouble I had is when applying it I realized it (the expensive, scientifically-engineered hair fibers) seemed comparable to that of a dark brown charcoal powder.  My complaint is that the product seemed cheap and did not do a good job for me in advancing my hairline in my temples or filling in my beard.  It simply looked like I was rubbing dirt or soot on my face and scalp.  The next time I have a barbecue, I plan to trial using the powder from the charcoal itself to see if it truly is comparable.  If I'm far out of left field on this one, I'll edit my review; however, based on what I had been lead to believe regarding the efficacy of this product and the price I had paid, I will not be able to increase my star rating.  I don't like to write reviews where I express disappointment but after paying $40 for this tiny bottle of temporary supposed hair thickening agent, I have little recourse else to make.  I hope others have been more successful and have enjoyed using this product to its fullest extent, but unfortunately that was not the case for me.",0
"This is a black piece of plastic. It holds shaving brushes. As other reviewers have noted, this stand is on the smaller side. If you have any doubts as to whether your brush will fit into it in a specific way, read the dimensions.

For a $6 shave stand, it performs quite well. It doesn't tip over easily, and it holds my brush tightly. I'm satisfied. Not thrilled (who gets thrilled over a brush stand?), but satisfied.",1
great quality,1
My hairdresser recommended this product.  Have been using it a couple of months and love it.  The sellers description didn't indicate if it came with all the attachments or not but it does.,1
Does an okay job but there is very little in the can.  Is very expensive for what you get.,0
"Compared with other over-the-counter moisturizers my wife had used before, L'Occitane Almond Supple Skin Oil performed better than most in hydrating her skin and making it supple without a greasy application. As she told me, It goes on smoothly. I don't feel oily and icky.

The almond fragrance lingers, which is why my wife doesnt use it in the morning. She applied&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Occitane-Almond-Supple-Skin-Oil/dp/B00IMJF09M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L'Occitane Almond Supple Skin Oil</a>&nbsp;at night after she removes her makeup and washes her face, just before she goes to bed.

It is a nice smell but not one I want to carry around with me all day long, she said. My wife doesnt have a strong sensitivity to perfumes but the almond fragrance of L'Occitane was too much for daily use.

Rating: 4 stars",1
Husband likes it but it dried out my hair quite badly. I won't be using it again so more for him! : ),0
Its nothing special I could have spent way less money and had just as good hair products if not better from everyday store selections. I have naturally curly hair and thought it would be perfect for my knotty curls but it worked the same as any conditioner or leave-in conditioner I already have or have tried...,0
I wear it frequently,1
I need that extra volume in my hair. It definatly helps...,1
Greasy and made my face break out.,0
I have been using this product for years and when I opened my bottle I purchased it was not the real Moroccan oil I have been using. It was fake and didn't have that same Moroccan oil smell!! Don't buy this product!,0
"The one I received was probably old. Based on positive reviews, it wasn't what I expected. It was barely nothing on the mascara and it was dry.",0
I'm disappointed by this nail polish particularly because the polish only seems to last a day or 2 before chipping. Also the color is more orange-red than just a nice/vibrant red which was also disappointing to me considering the cost. I'll likely stick with Essie products instead.,0
"Nice product so far. Needs a bit of leave-in conditioner over the product because it can leave the hair a bit hard, but I believe it works.",1
"I absolutely adore this Hot Tools 2 inch curling iron.  First of all, I had been looking for a two inch curling iron in the stores for a few months and they are not available.  So I found this one on amazon and decided to give it a try.  I can say that it is huge!  The barrel is really large and it works great on my long hair.  I have very long hair that does not look right when I use a normal sized curling iron, but when I use this one it makes my hair have a great thick curl on the bottom and it looks bouncy and full.  I definitely need to order another one to keep in my suitcase since I travel for work!",1
"Extremely disappointed with this curling iron. I had a conair that was several years old that worked awesome. Unfortunately my puppy chewed the cord, or I'm sure it would still be working.  This does not go through my hair smoothly. The curls won't hold. I thought maybe use it a few times it might get better. Nope. Wish I could send it back.  I have very thick wavy hair, that's always hold curls.  Not with this iron.",0
I love this cream but unfortunately it came without the cellophane wrapping and it didn't smell right...Not the same product.,0
I have had this iron just barely over a year and it turns on now but shuts off as soon as I start to use it. For $110 this should work more than a year. Will not waste my money on this brand again.,0
I'm a woman and I bought this to shave with. I love it. It shaves so close and the blades are ridiculously cheap. Be careful however as this can cut you much easier than newer style razors. It just takes a little more time and patience.,1
Very effective cleanser...very gentle on my sensitive skin,1
I use this pretty much everyday with or without makeup.,1
"I like the color of the dark green ""Envy"" but it stained my nails YELLOW. it has been weeks and they still have a yellow tint and looks disgusting. not happy at all",0
"Soothes my itchy, irritated skin.  Goes on white but when it absorbs into skin quickly, the white goes away.  What I really love and appreciate is the soothing effect, and it's definitely the best product I've found for that - and I've tried so many.  Avene products are really nice to my skin, and I highly recommend this one.  At the same time, my skin is dry, and I find I need to use a moisturizer in addition.  I use it as more of a treatment than a moisturizer.  Perhaps I will try the balm at some point, but it's easy enough to apply my moisturizer of choice on top once the cream has been absorbed.  I highly recommend this for sensitive, irritated skin.",1
I really like the light texture. I am happy that this product doesn't make me break out like every other product I've used!,1
The description says 'extra long barrel' but it is rather short. Everything else is great. Came with extra springs for the clamp.,1
"For a blowdrying novices, this is a great brush. It is light and easy to handle. I would recommend it.",1
"it smells good, makes my hair feel good, and doesn't strip it like regular shampoo",1
This was supposed to be one of the best flat irons. But mine seems to squeak every time I use it. Sounds like it needs wd40 or it's a defect model. I plan to contact seller about this issue.,0
"I thought this would be a good way to try out an expensive high quality skincare range.
Unfortunately the tiny amount of Super food cleanser  that was in the pot was totally dried out like a lump of dry paint and I couldn't use it at all. The pot, strangely enough, was of a reasonable size but there was just this thick crust inside.
Extremely disappointing. I would not recommend it to anyone - especially considering the cost of the normal quantity of product.

The little bottle of oil has proven to be quite good and I use it sparingly to good effect and I would consider that it could be a worthwhile investment for anyone interested in this line of skin care.",0
The color turns pink on my skin.  It does stay in place and cover well.,0
it worked for me.,1
I've had this machine for a year used it at my salon maybe 10 times...it's hard to clean and it barely turns out. This is machine is crap...don't waste your money,0
"Great, not greasy or hard but holds style. A bit pricy but worth the extra cost.  I have almond and lavender, almond good scent, lavender a bit feminine.",1
I returned this product. As a moisturizer it was ok. Did not control my oil. But the smell. I couldn't get past the smell. A cross between bug spray and flowers. Bleh. Not for me.,0
"I have sensitive skin so this is a good product to help me keep my eye shadow in place all day long.  Always had creases by early afternoon, but not with this product.  Will buy again.",1
Ordered this for father's day for my husband and he was very pleased as this is one of his best colognes,1
This was recommended by my facial therapist. I have used it for almost 3 months and I start to see some improvement on the fine lines under my eyes. I love it.,1
"I'm impressed. The Makeup Eraser removes my makeup easily and completely. I wear waterproof mascara, water-resistant foundation, and fairly heavy eyeshadow and brow powder. I was tired of using up cotton pads and remover liquid to get my makeup off at the end of the day--it was time consuming, expensive, and not always effective. This cloth and some warm water solves the problem.

I'm 60 years old and I try not to subject my skin to undue pulling and stretching. The Makeup Eraser requires only a gentle circular motion, and maybe a little extra wiping right at the eyelash edge. My face comes out makeup free and gently exfoliated, ready for moisturizer. What a great product!",1
Very nice product.  Works well.,1
"It is not a scent you run across everyday, it has a bold musk wood smell...but it grows on you.  If u want an unique odor that's not too loud but will make a guy turn his head to see whose wearing it, this is your scent.",1
Love it! But it is expensive,1
"I received a tester.
One thing that I noted was that there are artificial colors in this mask when it is pretty much just white anyway.  It seems like those are just unnecessary to me.  There's also some fragrance components that could cause some people problems, though the scent itself is just very light and not at all strong.  The clay is Kaolin.

It comes out as a thick white lotion that I spread over my face.  I received a tester and there were no instructions.  I used it like I would any other mask, applying it to my face and letting it dry before rinsing it well.

I picked this out to try because my skin is normally dry, but during big temperature changes like we have in the South during the spring, it gets very, very oily, and that's been a problem lately.  This has some menthol it in that felt slightly cooling on my skin.  I read while it dried and found it pleasant to have on.  It rinsed off easily.  I felt like it took every bit of oil, dirt, sweat- everything, out of my skin.  My skin felt vacuumed out.  My skin looked a bit rosy and felt a bit dry and tight.  I put some moisturizer on and my skin just sucked it up, much more than normal.  24 hours later and my skin still didn't feel oily, only normal.

I would say that this is going to be a product that people should figure out for themselves how often to use.  I would reserve use of it for myself for times during seasonal changes when my skin gets very oily.  I would avoid this normally when my skin was dry, because this mask is very drying to me.  I do really appreciate that it is good at decreasing oiliness and cleansing and tightening pores.

I would recommend this for people with oily skin.  It does have some ingredients that could be a problem or very sensitive skin though, and it could cause a bit of breakout at first- it has willow bark in it and ingredients that often will 'uncover' breakouts about to happen anyway, though they should be less serious than usual and descrease quickly.  This seems like it would be a great mask for teen guys and men with very oily skin too.",1
fine,1
SO SMALL ITS A JOKE BIG RIP OFF (DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ITEM),0
Ok so my favorite color out of the one that I bought was the Northern Lights one it's a really pretty color. The color online and when you look at the bottle does not do it justice. yet the reason why I give this will all of them two stars is because I got a manicure 2 days ago and most of it is already all off my nail this formula is awful I would not recommend it. I wasted money on this product and my mani. I can't even return this either which is the crappy part!! What am I going to do with this?? I'll never use it!,0
I used to love this product but they have changed the scent from orange to lavender.  It is still called Orange Cleansing Soap but that is no longer true.  It is too fragrant for me.,0
I tried it for about 2 weeks and found it not to be helpful.  I'm using another product which works better for my dark circles.,0
Great at adding a little volume but not too good for absorbing oil.,1
"Nice combination of rough and gentle. I have sensitive skin, so finding something that doesn't irritate or dry it out, while still providing enough abrasion to clean is a good buy.",1
I've had this for over a month and I don't think it works.  It hurts like crazy even on the lowest setting.  I have light brown skin and black hair which is supposed to be ok.,0
Very good product.,1
"Unite dries my hair out.  However Winsome and Wisdom, really makes a noticeable difference and my blond highlights just pop.  I will not buy again.",0
"This moisturizer is too thin.  While it doesn't break me out, it also does not keep my skin adequately hydrated.",0
Wife loves it.,1
"Does not provide enough true exfoliation. Formula is much too drying, most likely due to high alcohol content.  I have very oily skin and this product over-dried it, making it oilier and caused me to break out.  I prefer straight glycolic acid products that are made to be put on the skin for a few minutes and then washed off.  This product is made to be ""left on"" and I think that adds to the drying problem.  Like the Bioelements line, but cannot recommend this one.",0
"Very different from my beloved, discontinued l'Occitaine ""Ambre""...this has a sharp sandalwood tone that reminds me of hippie incense...does not smell inviting, warm and sensuous like Ambre.",0
junk don't waste ur time buying hey forget to tell u  ya have to buy other stuff to keep it on .,0
I've used this product for years and I love it. I get compliments on my skin all the time. It arrived quickly and I would definitely order again from this company.,1
"Been using the Eucalyptus Scented version for years. Lathers every bit as good, I'm just not as big of a fan of Sandalwood as I think others would be. Still, it's a fine soap in a bowl. Only downside is the Sandalwood scent lingers in my brush no matter how much I wash it out.",1
"I love the color!! Almost Tiffany blue!! A little streaky/runny to apply so I will try again with thinner coats & 2-3 applications. Brush handle is very short - separate from rectangular cap but easy enough to work with. I still like my Chanel nail polishes better & don't mind paying $27 for a bottle of Chanel as the quality & long wear is worth the price! Still this is a fun, bright summer color! Might take to my salon & have professionally applied to see if they know any tricks with the thin consistency of this polish. Just received today so unable to comment on longevity. I didn't use a base or top coat so that may also affect application - will update review after more use! SO PLEASED WITH COLOR that I want to make it work!",1
"Works well, rough but not too rough. Skin feels fresh after using it. I have tried a lot of BJ's products with mixed results, but this is one of my favorite",1
"Terrible product. It is clumpy, thick and the bottle is TINY. It is about a 2 inch bottle.",0
"I really really really like this product because it smells so good and I do like the foam and the feel! BUT! When the product arrived, I accidentally checked it against the light and noticed it was only 2/3 or less of the bottle. Thats very disappointing and shocking to me. I was ready to give it 5 stars but now I can only give two stars, one for the smell, one for the discount I got from Thanksgiving. It also makes my skin feel dry, maybe it is better for oily skin. My friend also told me this product is very easily to be used up. She felt that it pumped more than enough every time she used it. Now I think it might due to the bottle half full.",0
"Fragrance Free it is NOT!  Smells like mint or like my wife says ""Aspircream"" after shave!?",0
Doesn't really work as the original product,0
"Needed to update my replacement brush, didn't care for the brush that came with it. I think this is the one that came with my first Mia 1.",1
Really helps. Love it.,1
Expired.,0
Not as strong as expected but works well,1
"I talked to your girl, and she agrees, you've graduated from Irish Spring. Smell subtly wealthy with this fantastically European-smelling soap. Go for it.",1
"Over priced honestly.

1 part  Olive oil
2 parts Castor oil
6-12 drops of essential oil. (sandalwood)

There your set",0
"Very smooth and goes on at a good thickness.  Doesn't stay on for too long, but that's my only complaint.  I like the spf and natural ingredients.  I'll purchase again.",1
This product made me develop a rash / reaction in my underarms. First product of Jack Black to ever cause such a reaction. Luckily I notified the company and they gave me a refill. Beware of this potential side-effect,0
"I've used Retin A products for over 4 years now and know how they feel on your skin, esp after a long break. This did nothing, the drugstore products do a better job.",0
"I have used this product only briefly, but my skin care person used it on my last facial and I did like the results.  I have rosacea and need to be careful about the products I use.",1
"I use pureolgy for years. Not sure what they sent me , but my hair has never been so dry and faded my color to brassy in a day.",0
"I had great hopes for this line- bought full system and its awful! Not only did it not volumize or improve the thickness/length or growth of my hair, but its sticky/gross feeling, was difficult to comb through n work with and made my hair feel dirty. I had to wash it out couple hours after I applied. Dont buy this!",0
"I have a Turbo 3200 hairdryer and, unfortunately, this didn't fit it at all. I think with most universal diffusers, you have to just keep trying until you find the right one that fits your hairdryer.",0
Color is nice but the liquid doesn't glide smoothly to the nail... This is my third coat! I will review again if it gets better.,0
This was nothing special and did not leave my hair in any better shape than when I used cheaper shampoo and conditioner.  It's not worth the hype or the price.  Great to try a sample though at a smaller price before you commit to a larger product size and more money out of your wallet.,0
"This is by far the best concealer I have ever tried, after exhausting drugstore and low-end brands. Unfortunately I am no longer able to find it very easily in stores (Macys, Nordstrom, Sephora all no longer sell it) and Amazon is pretty much the only place I can find it. I get '02' shade, and I am very pale (Julianne Moore coloring, exactly). The consistency is thin, but not watery. I use it for undereye circles mostly, but it works very well all-over or for specific red spots. Just pat with your ring or pinky finger gently and it melts into your skin. No shimmer hidden in this whatsoever, but it has a brightening effect. Looks so natural, I can barely tell it's there with a mirror held close in direct sunlight. Love the packaging, as it allows you to squeeze the remaining product out for the wand to pick up when it gets low. I use with Urban Decay all-nighter spray and it lasts 12+ hours (otherwise you would need to touch up mid-day).",1
"This is for the Tolerance Extreme CREAM (as per the description even though the picture shows the MASK)...hands down, one hundred thousand percent, the best moisturizer I've ever used. I have combo skin, gets really dry if I don't moisturize but then oily after a few hours of makeup. But my biggest skin drama is how SENSITIVE it is as I've gotten older. Red, irritated, flushed, hot, dermatitis, rosacea, you name it, my skin will do it at the drop of a dime. Enter Avene. This cream is a godsend. It soothes away almost any and all face irritation in a day or two tops, no lie. It's rich and creamy but somehow never ever leaves me shiny or greasy. Wears easy under makeup, even. It's kind of perfect. (I've also used the Tolerance Extreme Emulsion, but found it way too drying.)",1
The color of it was different from how it was listed.,0
I have dry skin and I use this along with Bioelements Sleepwear before i go to bed.  It's perfect.  It makes the area around my eyes feel soft.  I haven't used it long enough to notice any change in the lines around my eyes.,1
Works good,1
Too big for the toppik bottle...,0
"With the fragrance that could blend in with a dollar store product and only mild exfoliation grit, this product will not be found in my grooming rotation anymore.  I've tried many products on my quest to find my perfect face wash.  This one ranks above supermarket commoners such as Aveeno and St Ives, but is far behind those found in the $20+ range.",0
"This eye cream seems to do nothing.
I'll give it 2 stars for nice packaging that looks quite lovely sitting out on my bathroom counter and for smelling pretty.
It pills up and rubs off no matter what moisturizer or foundation/tinted sunscreen I use.
Even worse, it seems to actually dry my eye area right out.  As a result, wrinkles and crinkles are more pronounced. Applied this in the morning before work and by 11am I can actually feel how dried out and parched my eye area has become.
I've tried drugstore eye creams and balms that are half the price and do more for my eye area than this stuff.",0
"I curl my lashes first, then apply this mascara (Eyeko Sport Brush Mascara, Black) and off I go. No flaking, gives me just enough length that doesn't look too extra, gives nice volume, and most importantly, it helps my lashes keep their curl all day. I feel like I've tried all the big brands Lancome Definicils, Dior, Mac...this is my #1. The only other one that I *used to* swap with is They're Real from Benefit. But even that sometimes smears. Small tip: pair this with their Eye Do Liquid Eyeliner - nice, simple, chic.",1
This came with a brush not a lippy,1
"very PURPLE, not coral",0
"I was displeased with the 'pale' of the pink color and the coverage of the polish wasn't even.  I can't see where it was worth the extra cost over, say OPI.",0
Snapped In half after a couple days,0
"Not the scent I was looking for, but very pretty looking and nicely packaged.",0
"Good product, good quality and size as expected. Delivered on time. My husband loves it. I gave it 4 stars because it is a bit pricey for this kind of product and it does not have case.",1
Not Good,0
It is really a good product. It is very helpful and I recommend it to everyone who has dry lips,1
"Clumpy.  I usually like Lorac, perhaps this was an old tube?",0
"This is a watery like consistency, easy to spread, and layer on to achieve a darker color.  Easy to layer. The stain does tend to fade after a couple of hours and you have a lightly color stained lip,  you have to reapply if you want the deeper color again.  Smells good and smells like grape, taste is fine too.  I don't like how it will stain dry parts of your lip differently. So use chap stick or something similar underneath if you have dry lips or dry patches.  Will stain your fingers easy, will wash off.  Color does come out as a pinkish red.",1
Love this stuff. Smells like the beach. Works great to help remove remaining oil and dirt after washing wash.,1
This is only $28 on sephora....,0
"Looked terrible on my skin, but I love the brand.",0
"This item is very small, I tought I would get something bigger. I bought it with another babyliss flat iron wich I loved. But this tiny one was a waste of money I would not recomended.",0
"I've been using the Juice Beauty Blemish Clearing Peel for nearly three weeks, and have had a positive experience.  I have dry skin, and I don't usually have many blemishes or acne.  However, I am using a prescription antibiotic cream on some facial abrasions, and when the cream touches any other part of my face, I'll break out.

The label directions say to leave the peel on your face for 10 minutes, but as I have dry skin, I tested several different times.  I found that 3 minutes was not long enough, but between 5 - 7 minutes worked well.  It's most convenient for me to use the peel directly after a shower, but I think your skin will be less sensitive if you wait.  The peel tingles a little bit, but that stops in a minute or less.  Then I just gently remove the peel with warm water and followed with a moisturizer.

The small, red blemishes I had virtually disappeared, and some of the newer / larger blemishes were smaller and less red.  By the next day, the marks from the smaller blemishes were gone. This exceeded my expectations, and although I doubt the result would be the same on severe acne, it demonstrated to me that the Juice Beauty Peel made a material difference.

I also like that the product is USDA organic, which may be a marketing claim, but still---better to be organic than not!  The peel is in an easily recycled glass jar, and not a #5 or #7 plastic, which is great.

Overall, I would highly recommend this product, just be sure to test different times and follow with a moisturizer.",1
Don't like it.  Just gives slight shiny tint. Almost no color.,0
Not as tight of grasp as I expected for the money I paid.,0
"really good diffuser...large enough to handle thick, long hair.  deep concave well for the hair to go into and keep your curls curly!",1
Good Price,1
Love this lotion. Arrived in no time. Perfect.,1
"drys my thick long hair well. blow drying sessions are much shorter now, and less painful on my wrist because it is lightweight",1
"I purchased this hair dryer and it was delivered in due time, all ok. Living overseas as an international worker, I wanted something durable and honestly I haven't used it more that 15 times altogether! One day, during the blow drying it simply stopped working and never came back! I am very dissapointed, as in the areas where beauty salon and similar services are very underdeveloped, investing in the tools and then not being able to use them is a very devastating thing!",0
"I don't know if I got an expired or faked product, or if this particular spray just doesn't work on my hair, but I found no moisture and no ability to detangle after using small or large amounts of this stuff. It smells fine to me, and has the consistency of thin rinse-out conditioner (it is opaque). Whatever the reason, this ""tonic"" seems to have zero effect on my dry frizzy hair. Returned.",0
"Definitely does not ""smell like rottin meat"" smells like pez. It goes on smooth, makes my skin feel great, is slightly sticky but dries pretty smooth. I just wish more came in a bottle for the price",1
I only quickly tried this before I mailed it to my sister. Expensive for a travel size for sure. I do like the Jane Iredale line but I'm currently a Mac gal right now. I did not like the brush that was included because it's kind of useless. But this travel size came in a box with instructions on how to apply the makeup and that was nice. I guess that's the least they can do when you pay over $50 bucks for a travel size.,1
Disappointed,0
"I read that a few people said that these pads were dry. Well let me tell you, they weren't lying. I don't know what JB is trying to do with this product. I'd tried a 12-piece sample and loved it, but this jar? Oh no ... they are bone dry. The top ones are dry, the middle ones are dry, and even the bottom ... dry. Perhaps if you want an organic swab for removing makeup or putting on toner, this might work. But it cannot possibly be a nightly brightening peel without actually having some product on the pad! This qualifies as the worst $45 purchase I can remember. If you want a moist pad, pass this one by.",0
Thanks,1
"Love this soothing lip conditioning creme. It is very different than the rest of the gummy , tacky products out there. It really softens the lip area and prepares it to look great alone or with a lipstain.",1
"When I received the package, it was damaged, leaking and there was no top. It may have been used, I don't know. Needless to say, I returned it.",0
"After initially applying this to my lips I immediately really felt the irritation.
I finally had to go to a dermatologist after several days of using this product and the damage to my lips and it caused,
The doctor put me on a high level of Cortizone topical for my labs which was unpleasant as self but finally healed my lips a little bit.
When I called the company to complain they offered no refund or any other recourse that just stop using the product immediately,
I've learned just because something is expensive doesn't mean it's going to be helpful at work for you.",0
"It has made a huge difference in the feel and manageablity of my hair and skin...love it.  But it needs to be able to glide up and down and side to side much better than it is presently designed.  I'm tall, and would like to be able to move the shower head.  The different settings are great.",1
I expected this conditioner to be very rich and thick but it isn't. Conditioners at this price level are usually easy to work into the hair.  I can barely work it through my hair and I have to use way more than necessary. After rinsing My hair is so tangled I have to use my kids detangler spray. I wish i could send it back.,0
I don't believe you can get this perfume new in box at this price anywhere else. Add fast shipping to the equation and you've got yourself an excellent deal. Thank you!,1
"I ordered a 1-1/4"" which was too big for my fine hair. Unfortunately I threw away the box so I was unable to return it. My hairdresser use a 1"" on my hair and it works fantastic. I should have checked with her before I ordered this one to make sure I was ordering the correct barrel size.",0
"Great razor.  Mild blade reveal (fixed) so you can use a very sharp blade like a Feather.  A more mild blade like a Voskhod or similar will work well, but the blade reveal is indeed mild, so I prefer the sharpest blade I can get.  I use Feather and it's a match made in heaven.  The Edwin Jagger DE89 also works similarly and is manufactured the same.  Both of these razors are tuned well for a very sharp blade like the Fether.",1
Worked great.  For 19 months.  Then it only worked on low.  Then it only blew cold air.  Don't waste your money.,0
fell apart after 4 months of use.  CHEAP!@,0
Dulls my silver hair!  Wont continue using this product!,0
"I bought this as part of my husband's birthday gift, and he really likes it. He says it lathers very well and works great.",1
Quick ship.  Product is nice.,1
Great conditioner but I'm not impressed with how I received it broken and pouring out of the container...,0
Strange handle.  I prefer the conventional grip handle.,0
"Is this a genuine product? Egh, I hope not. The consistency of the product appeared thick, but the scent was off...dull.
Should've pumped the breaks. ; )

In the past, I've had positive 'salon' experiences with  genuine Olaplex products; however, this was NOT one of them.

Long story short, I AM NOT blown away by this particular product (allegedly, Olaplex No. 3).

Long story moderate, I gave it 3 fair shakes (because I wanted to belieeeeve! lol), and everytime, BUST! My results were consistently, garbage. Every. Single. Time.

I CAN report on a clear and notable DIFFERENCE in my hair texture... it seems coarser (in a dry way), more vulnerable to VISIBLE breakage, oh, and of course, tangled. Bonded? Stronger? I'm sorry, no & no. I was not shooting for 'deep conditioning', but this product appeared to strip my hair of its existing moisture.

I suppose it's possible that I received a bogus batch, since other reviewers seemed more than pleased by the results of their product (allegedly Olaplex No. 3), as a stand alone tx. I'm just questioning the authenticity of THIS particular batch. Either way, I'm bummed that I purchased an inferior product.

  ...On to the next hairpothesis! : )",0
"Baxter's Hard Water Pomade claims to be a firm hold/shine finish product. It feels like a greasy, thick gel. I will say right off the bat, it does give you a good hold and it does err toward to a shiny finish (which could be pro or con depending on if you want a wet or dry look).

For me, I find the best way to use hair products is to layer them. So I would 1) work in a soft creme, or a comparable workable pomade; 2) add a thickening agent like a hard creme; and 3) finish with something that gives a firm hold, like this stuff. That said, if you only could buy one product, this one is flexible enough to be used on its own without the other layers of product.

Also, not a huge believer in the ""less is more"" rule when it comes to hair products. I prefer a good finger full evenly worked throughout. Same for this product. I mean I don't goop it on, but using a ""dime-size"" isn't enough. You need a decent amount spread over all your hair for a firm, balanced hold.

Since all hair is different and the styles desired by people are too, hair products can be very subjective in how they are rated. That caveat aside, if your hair is short and you do use product, then I'd bet this hard water pomade could find a home in your hair product selection. It is pliable and can be reworked several times before it starts to set. Once it does, you would need water to really work it again; kind of a bummer, since so many products can just be reworked as necessary now without the need for re-wetting. As a closing note, the glass jar this stuff comes in is really cool.

In the end, I would use the product again because it can serve as an all-in-one hair product and don't mind a shine finish (at least right now with my current hair style).",1
"this stuff  has a MAJOR odor of sunblock. i didn't appreciate that at all. the top was weird to figure out. why it is doubled up, no idea. tube is very small also. i wouldn't use it as moisturizer ...strictly as sunblock. i did like that it was not at all greasy BUT a little goes a long way.",0
Absolutely hate the smell of this. I love the fragrance of L'Occitane's Citrus Verbena Cooling Deodorant - but this one is really bad.,0
"I love, love this product.  My hair is fine and frizzes and when I use this it gives me shine as well as anti-frizz effects.",1
"Correction to original review:  A comment re the high cost of shipping was inadvertently inserted in the original review I wrote.  It was meant for another item purchased at the same time from a different seller.  The actual seller of this product, provided me with prompt delivery and a product I have come to rely on.  I have thick, wavy hair and it usually needs taming.  This clay does the job without leaving my hair feeling greasy or weighed down.  It gives texture and shape.  It is my ""go to"" hair product.",1
Arrived on time. No leaks. Good packaging. Ive been using this face wash for months and I love it! It helps keep my breakouts under control and it doesnt dry my skin out. Perfect face wash for sensitive acne prone skin.,1
"I don't often write reviews, but felt compelled to write on for this product.  I consider this one of the worst $50 i've ever spent. I've been a loyal user of Art of Shaving (AoS) products for ~ 15 years, particularly the lavender shave cream. After reading other reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try. It is terrible.  My bar of dove soap provides a better lather than this garbage. When I shave with the AoS cream, I place a dab of lavender cream on an AoS brush, work it into the brush for a second, then re-dab the brush quickly under hot water. The cream stays/remains on the brush even with this quick dab under hot water, allowing me to lather warm cream/foam onto my face (after all, who likes to lather cold shave cream on their face, and shave with a cold lather).  I can't do that with this product. The ""lather"" this product creates is so weak and so thin, that even the slightest dab under warm water washes most of the stuff off of the brush. So, you are left having to lather this stuff on cold (even if you heat th brush with warm water first, by the time you swirl the warm wet brush around this shaving soap and bring it to your face, it is cold, so essentially you just have to use it cold. If you are looking for a product that allows a nice, rich, warm lather, do NOT buy this product. I checked the AoS website, which says they do not allow refunds/exchanges for products that have been ""used"", so i'm stuck with a $50 bowl of soap that i'll never use.",0
My mother uses this and it's by far one of the worst smelling products I've ever smelled. Is this dry shampoo or a hairspray? Does anyone have an alternative that doesn't smell like this? Thanks.,0
"I don't think this was a genuine product. After some research i found out it was supposed to have a citrusy smell. The smell or rather stink of the product got me researching in the first place. It smelled bad. So either it was expired, although the date on t h e bottle would suggest otherwise or it was a fake. Wish i got my money back instead of tossing it.",0
Great stuff. Baby has sensitive skin and this is wonderful for the sun. All natural and smells great. First bought on vacation and now a repeat buyer.,1
I'm so disappointed in this productPurchased it in July 2017 ( 2 months ago)  & it just died (!) on Sept. 1  - no warning - just turned it on and NOTHING - tried reset button then every outlet in my house . Tried plugging in other products to make sure that wasn't the problem - would send it back but don't have packaging so I'm out $200!!!,0
One of my favorite brushes; smaller sized but doesn't pull and holds up well.,1
"It smells nice and makes your hair very shiny. It doesn't make my hair as soft as I'd like, but the shine is undeniable. I think with continued use it will help my damaged ends a lot.",1
Recommended by my dermatologist office for sun protection. Like a Chapstick. I think this will work well.,1
Spilled almost half... Very disappointed,0
After few weeks of using I have not notice any positive results.  My face does not even feel clean after washing with it. So far very dissatisfied. I used this brand product about 8 years ago and loved it but now it seems to be different. Why?,0
I am beginning to see the growth of a few hair follicles in less than 2 weeks.,1
"Made my hair sticky. There are better, more cost effective options out there.",0
"Will buy again and again. This is the only fragrance my Mom wears, it is more affordable with this company.",1
"I decided to try a cleansing conditioner in an effort to be a bit more gentle to my color treated hair, but unfortunately the smell just absolutely ruins whatever benefit the product may have.

Imagine a slightly citrus-y bong water odor. I wish I was exaggerating.

I could almost forgive the smell if this were an amazing product despite the unique olfactory experience, but it left my hair feeling greasy, despite my experimenting with longer rinse times, and multiple attempts between full shampoos.

Definitely wouldn't purchase again.",0
"As others have mentioned, the ingredients have changed (less rosewater, more cheap stuff like fragrance). This new formulation is giving me bad breakouts and clogged pores. I'm switching to Robert's concentrated rosewater, let's see how that goes.",0
Best Shaving cream of all time,1
The items may be great for others but these products left my face extremely dry with scars on my face.  I now have to see a dermatologist to help clear.,0
Saved my money all this time for this??? Smells like an old lady's shoe!!* I'm just going to return it... Egh!!!* Save your self the TROUBLE...,0
Nothing on Earth has ever made me feel so good.  I take this everywhere - it's my little freshness secret!,1
I read rave reviews about this hair dryer and had my dad get this for me for Christmas. I started out really excited using it but it would make goofy noses that would kind of frightened me so I would shut it off and then use. When I would turn it on again it would work just fine for a little bit. It also will suck my hair in the end because it has so much suction and with my long hair that can be pretty painful sometimes.,0
The greatest,1
i bought one of these to help get my face cleaner than regular cleansing  It was pricey but worth it. The only issue I have is really my own. You have to use it consistently or your results will vary,1
"It's heavy and hard to apply, comes off on my skin and makes me look like a hooker.",0
"I was noticing that the skin around my eyes was really starting to show my age (56).  The rest of my face looks pretty good as I use alot of different high quality skincare products (Dr. Denese, Peter Thomas Roth, etc.). I just had not found the right one for my eye area, until I tried Strivectin.  It took about a month to see any results, but after that wow!!! what a difference. The skin is firmer, less bags, less dark shadowing.  I love it...it's worth every penny!!",1
Just ok  Over priced nail polish,0
"This did not fit my T3 dryer.  Wish there was a clearer way to verify what attachments are available for the particular model that I have.  This is not clear even on the manufacturers website.  For those of us who received a T3 as a gift, pictorials would help.",0
This works great for my daughter. She will apply this at night and it will draw the pimple out by the morning.,1
Terrible,0
Love this color. It's a pretty kind of gray-purple. It's a high-quality nail polish and it stays on for a few days without chipping (I work with my hands and have most manicures chip the next day). Would recommend!,1
"I've been using this product for years and I love it.  It does what it says - adds volume.  It has a pleasant scent that isn't over-powering.  I also use the shampoo.  And, I am especially pleased because it is listed with PETA as a product that does not test on animals (although it does not have the ""bunny"" symbol for being against animal cruelty/testing.  As long as it's animal friendly, I will continue to use it.",1
DOES NOT FIT THE BABYLISS CERAMIC XTREME HAIRDRYER!,0
"I ordered this product wanting to give my skin more of a healthy appearance. However, this product is not what I ordered in the mail (although this order did arrive promptly). Notice that in the image the bottle says ""LIGNE CLARIFYL,"" mine says ""LIGNE SPECIALE."" The container/bottle is completely different than the image on the product page, and opening it, there isn't a pleasant ""grapefruit"" smell like the other reviews have mentioned - it smells soapy and non-pleasant. I am going to contact the seller in hopes that this was just a mixup, and I will try to add to this in an update.",0
Great product !,1
"Hopefully this will work and get rid of the wrinkles.  I must say my overall complexion has improved.

But, I resent writing a review and then being told I must add 5 more words.  Just the review I gave should suffice.",1
"a bit pricey, but i really like this soap.  lasts a while, too.",1
"I received this blow dryer as a gift from my sister a year ago. I had always used drugstore dryers and thought air was air and a blow dryer is a blow dryer. Wow was I wrong. This BD dried my hair fast (a huge plus as I have very thick hair that takes forever to dry), left it smooth, shiny, voluminous, and gave it a just left the salon look. My one and only complaint is that it breaks extremely easy when dropped. I was sitting down drying my hair on the double (a rug on the carpet)carpeted floor and mistakenly dropped it. I honestly didn't drop it hard or far.....about 2 feet from the carpet at most. Well the inside of the BD broke into a gazillion plastic pieces and stopped working. I don't know if the plastic part weakened from the prolonged heat exposure,or what exactly happened. All I know is that it definitely should not have broken that easily. I have dropped BD's from much higher and on tile and it still held up. Unfortunately the dryer was a gift and I didn't have a receipt or I would have contacted the company and explained the situation. I don't know how they would have handled it,so I can't comment about the customer service. I do admit it was my fault for dropping it, but........
Overall,I would recommend this blow dryer for the beautiful results, but beware of the cheaply made ""parts"" on the inside. Hopefully you won't have this problem.",1
"Love, love, love THIS product! Worked just as promised. I had acrylics for about four years and ever since having them off my nails never looked right without polish! Constant peeling and flakiness from extremely brittle and weak nails. I used this product every day as directed changing the entire polish once a week. The results are fabulous! My nails have never been this long or strong in my life! For the first time I was able to grow them out without my nails bending and peeling off. Attached are my results after a month of use! Going to try it on my toes next!",1
"It's ridiculously over priced.  I thought $13 was a lot for a tube of toothpaste, but figured for a ""large"" tube and what it promised, I'd try it.  The size of the tube was about like those you buy at Bed, Bath and Beyond for your luggage.  I won't purchase this again.  I'll just use a gel toothpaste on my lumineers before I pay this price for a tiny little tube of paste.",0
"When I received these clippers, I was impressed by the finish.  But I was a bit disappointed to see that they are made in Vietnam, not Germany.  Whatever.  However, after only 6 or 7 uses, the lever actually broke into 2 pieces.  Maybe I got an atypical example, but even low quality drugstore clippers don't do this.",0
Brand new and arrived in great time.  Thank you.,1
"While the mint smell of this conditioner is nice because it's not overwhelming, that's about the only good thing I can say about it. I'm just not sure why it's priced at $15 when it's chock full of chemicals that most higher quality companies have been leaving out of their shampoos and conditioners for years. And after using it, it didn't work well enough to make it worth that price tag, either - my hair felt like I'd used any old bottle of drugstore/supermarket conditioner. The only reason I'm not throwing it away is because I can tuck it aside in case I run out of a better conditioner and forget to go to the store to pick up more.",0
"The moisturizer itself is fine, but the metal bottle it comes in is badly dented (at least five different dents). It was shipped in a very thin padded mailer that was too large, and without any additional wrapping around the bottle.",0
I like it very tingly,1
"Not a big fan of the smell, leaves hair feeling tangled",0
Everything was great!,1
Really powerful! I wish it had a comb as an attachment.,1
"Not a big fan. I have tried various Zirh products over the years and find them high quality and worth the price of admission.  I decided to try their shave cream . I have been using The Art of Shaving Shave Cream for a couple of years, where I switched from the Zirh Shave Gel (which I liked very much).  I have to say, while the AoS shave cream is more expensive, I feel it is worth the extra money, you use much less product and get a great lather and it lasts considerably longer than the Zirh shave cream in my opinion.",0
"more expensive than I usually buy but I have severe eye allergies, and only wear eye makeup occasionally, as I am retired. This brand is gentle, applies easily, and doesn't irritate my eyes when removing it. So the extra cost is worth it, in my opinion.",1
"I'm updating my previous review. The heating unit lasted only 2 months -- just long enough to pass the 30-day return policy through Amazon -- and I didn't use it every day. I'm totally disappointed in BaByliss, a normally good brand.

Excerpt from previous review: 5 stars ""This BaByliss is a wonderful iron that does the job of a full-size iron for me ... It's compact, heats up fast, and straightens nicely.... """,0
"Nice rich lather, but this soap does not have any fragrance. This should be listed as fragrance free.",0
This cologne does not smell like the 20 other bottles of this cologne I have owned in the past? I don't know if it is old or got heated some way prior to delivery.  I am disappointed in the scent.,0
"I expected more from this product, but, unfortunately, it did not work well for my hair. I have full, but fine, frizzy curly hair and this leave-in does not do anything for it. It was an expensive and disappointing purchase. I do not recommend it.",0
Smells great,1
"Light/Medium shouldn't be a shade.  I have fair skin and it looks like another reviewer said, ""peanut butter on my skin.""  It doesn't blend at all and isn't hydrating.",0
"Wish it were free of toxins, but I kind of love it.",1
"I have very sensitive skin and I was very hopeful this would help- but I was disappointed. I still ended up with several red blotches and razor bumps. It was actually worse than not using the product altogether. I have used the same Taylor of Old Bond shaving cream without the slick water and I ended up with less irritation. Apparently there is something in it that irritates my skin.

I will have to stick with bump stopper II after the shave.",0
"Not much diff between this crema and the gazillion others I've tried, except that the Proraso fragrance should more properly be called a SMELL. And not a good one, at least to my highly uneducated nose.  Finally, this isn't returnable, so the whole deal STINKS!",0
"This blower is not for all types of hair. My hair is thin and pressure is too strong, even at the lower level. Also too overpriced",0
"Bought this after the $5 revlon curler I bought broke 2 days after using it. $5 adds up! I just decided to get a better quality curler and this is it! It's sturdy, gives a nice curl, and is easy to use. Good buy!",1
"I bought this product because I had previously used Kajal liner and it was great (but not always stocked at my local Sephora) but was incredibly disappointed. Color doesn't last and it constantly kept getting into my eyes. My contacts were either always smudged, or my eyes were irritated. It was the only product that I had changed in my routine. I had to return it. :(",0
I like other Bioelements products but this is not very moisturizing and has an unpleasant fragrance.  I do not recommend this product.,0
Stopped working after less than one month.  We have returned it for warranty replacement/repair but have not received it back as yet.  Extremely disappointed in the durability of this over $100 product.,0
I didn't notice a difference. The nail polish chips before its time to reapply it. I wish it was thinner like an oil treatment that can soak in your nails instead of keep changing it,0
"I use this product daily and have always bought it from my hair dresser. This is a great product, but today when I received my package, the lid popped off in transit. And when I removed the plastic wrap, the oil spilled out on my counter and floor. See the pictures below. Maybe the heat affected the pressure in the bottle? I rarely have issues with Amazon orders, but tjis one was a bust  a waste of money.  ",0
"Very good customer service from the seller, unfortunately the product didn't meet my expectations, have to pass the iron several times and the results on my hair were not 100% satisfactory.",0
Didn't work well for me!,0
All was wonderful,1
"I carefully researched the best hair dryer for my thick, frizzy hair; I was not disappointed by this product. My drying time, usually 15-20 minutes was cut in half. The frizz factor was cut by about 40%. My only complaint is the dryer is pretty heavy.",1
"I have not seen any change yet but I am not giving up yet. I am only 31 years old and look young everywhere except for my eyes. Very puffy and starting to have circles as well.
My dermatologist recommended so I will give it a few months!",0
Love love love this eyeliner!! I've tried so many different eyeliners and this is by far the best one!,1
good product. worth the money.,1
"Great product, my daughter loves it.",1
This is a great comb to have and Baxter makes nothing but a quality product.,1
I was super excited to get this package and opened it up to find out there was no applicator which is a big reason I buy this product because it's a different kind of highlighter applicator and I paid a lot of money for this and it wasn't even there .. Disappointed to say the least,0
This did nothing for me...  it smells like you're rubbing alcohol on your face.,0
"This lip balm is SO long lasting. It is such a beautiful shade. It is a little harder to apply than normal lip gloss or stick. I would recommend lining your lips before putting it on. I apply it probably only 2 times a day for all day wear! That includes eating and drinking. Once it is on your lips, it is there to stay. Pricey, but it is worth it.",1
I bought this after seeing a video with a woman who had a large following on her over 50 beauty site...seemed credible enough...and swore this product made broken capillaries disappear before her eyes...so I bought it.  BIG mistake!  I've been using it as directed for 1 month now...morning & night...with ZERO results.  I only have a few broken caps around my nose & 2 dots on my cheek...no big thing...and yet all are still there with no sign of fading!  Don't bother with this item...not worth the price ...not even close...lesson learned!,0
Great vendor.  Great product.,1
Turns yellow after 1 day. And chips after 2,0
We bought it as a Christmas gift for our daughter. It got warm but would not make a curl. When we tried to return it they refused to take it back. We are so upset with this vender and Amazon that we will not be using either in the future. Pretty stupid to loose a good customer over $25.00.,0
"First off, let me say I did not order this from Amazon but bought it at a dept. store.  My review is on the smell of the perfume.  It's very heavy and I didn't like it, but that's my fault for not trying it before buying.  I never took it back and it sat for years on my dresser and just recently I started using it as a bathroom air freshener.  It works great for that! I just don't like wearing it on my person! :-)",0
Love it,1
"I got this along with the cream cleanser for my daughter who's been dealing with eczema for almost 4 months now. Based on good reviews I got this, desperate to find the right cream. This cream does not do a better job than any of the other fragrance free creams. It's simply labeled for eczema and its pricey, but nothing effective.",0
"I felt nothing of the sort that some reviews mentioned. It was like nothing at all.
What a waste of my money!
If there is a money back guarantee then please return what I paid.
Jim",0
$20 expensive. Had to use a credit,0
I was swayed by the great reviews.  I wouldn't purchase again.  There must be some trick to using it because I can not get as good a shave as with Lab Series or Headslick.,0
felt itchy after using it several times,0
Love this product.,1
"Everything about Moroccan products is 5 star.  From reviews, I thought I would give this a try. If you live in an area with hard water this is an excellent product to use once in awhile. It does remove all of the mineral build up.  I'll purchase again and it is less expensive than buying at my beauticians.",1
It was not the same elemis frangipani monoi body oil I brought on the cruise that  l took 2 years ago. I don't care about the other reviews I'm telling you it was not the same oil the smell and the oil was not the same sorry.,0
Loved the product!  Was disappointed that the sender did not package it right and it showed up in a broken jar.,0
"This hairdryer worked great when first purchased - very powerful for its price.

Unfortunately, 8 months later, the high speed setting no longer works. With long hair, this makes the dryer all but redundant unless you want to commit your entire morning to your hair. The rubber around the handle has also started to fray and peel. The dryer was never put under any more stress than you would expect - used to dry hair once every other day, stored in the bedroom away from steam and humidity.

I can't recall if it came with a warranty (I assume it did; although the box, instructions, etc were lost during a move). If you do buy this dryer, I recommend keeping hold of all that information just in case. I emailed the seller to see if they could help on the warranty situation but never got a response.",0
"I had never tried this before, but my girlfriend had had a recent experience with it and had loved it.

I generally give 5 stars to anything I approve of and would reccommend.  That is the case with this product.",1
Bad is not for me my skin got worse.,0
This stuff is messy and smelly while being sprayed. It leaves a peach-colored residue on my bathroom floor when I use it and it has the same results as baby powder in my hair. Save your money.,0
"was expecting this to be the color of the bottle. It is not, is a muddy color, lacking any pink.",0
This polish is not nearly as light an aqua color as the picture on Amazon. It is pretty and is OPI sonis hreat quality but wasn't the color I had hoped for.,0
Excellent perfume I love the smell,1
"This trial-size Vichy skincare set comes nicely packaged in a reusable blue tin and would make a nice gift or, say, shower door prize.

The cost is high for a travel-size set, but it does give you some of Vichy's more popular -- and in the case of the cream and serum -- pricier products.

In terms of the products themselves, the Ideal Body lotion is a rather small tube (just a few uses) of good, but not outstanding, body lotion. Not something I'd buy again, due to its cost, but a good product, with a light scent that absorbs well and goes on non-greasy.

The makeup remover is extremely liquid (water-consistency) and uses a cotton ball to apply. Again, this is a true sample size, but would last through a week or more of daily use, assuming you'd mainly use it to remove eye makeup as intended. It did that job fairly well, needing a couple passes for waterproof mascara, but overall getting it done without stinging or irritating contact lens eyes.

The serum is about half a normal size but will last quite a while, as you use very little. It left my skin feeling dewy and can be combined with moisturizer, which is my preferred application method. I liked it, and the sample size is enough for probably a month or more if you use it every other day, as I tend to. (Full size version of this product sells for around $45.)

The face cream was the nicest of the bunch, to my mind. Dewy, without being greasy and worked well on my combination skin. I do wish it had sunscreen built in, but otherwise thought it was a good, mid-priced ($45 for full size jar) moisturizer, where a little goes a long way and I think this good-sized tub should last most women 3-4 weeks with daily use.

Overall, I'd say if this was under $20 it would be outstanding; at a bit more than that, I still think it's a good set, since I did like the two most expensive products.",1
"The colors are off. They have 2 different colors in the description. Make sure you look at the nail polish color, not the other description, very misleading...",0
"Product came opened and dirty, which is gross, considering it's a roll on. Pretty sure it was used even though I purchased it as new. Other than that, the actual product smells nice. My negative review is due to the product condition it was sold to me in, not the actual product. I'd give it a 5 for scent. Very fresh and classy.",0
"I really enjoy the eShave pre shave oil product.  It is a thinner oil, which I personally prefer.  It still works wonders and reduces nicks significantly.  Allows for a better and more comfortable shave.  Lost a star due to the scent was practically non-existent.  I think I will switch back to the Verbena Lime scent once this bottle is gone.",1
"As a Professional i love this product and it does the job well....you cant go wrong with any PCA product.
I have tons of oil on my face and with mild to little acne i can see the difference after 2~3 days. My oily face also is tamed down while using this product.",1
I bought this for my destination wedding ! It never got hot and I didn't have any other hair tools - total waste of money and ruined my hair for the day,0
I love the color Like Linen but it's super runny. I've put on four coats and it still isn't a solid color on my nails..,0
The product is wonderful ! Will purchase again !,1
I have one eye that waters. It does not stay on. Fine for the young set I guess.,0
The polish was dried up and not useable. Very disappointing,0
Yes it is all i wanted to do my hair as a professional. I have nothing more to say. Thanks for asking.,1
"So I used this to contour, and it worked great and blended in very well, It's also very soft.",1
I have coarse hair and this products softens my hair and no frizzes.  It's so convenient to be able to purchase online!,1
"it doesn't feel like my skin is clean, not a fan.",0
"Easy to follow the instructions and when you do, this setting powder works well. I don't use a heavy amount of make-up. I use concealer, liquid foundation, blush, brow pencil and mascara. Occasionally I will use eye lid color and lipstick. I don't like my make-up to feel heavy but I want to forget I'm wearing it. This powered gives that light feel of not being there but still helps keep the make-up I do wear from bleeding out and fading away. I did need to reapply during the day but otherwise, it works well.",1
it worked great but it no longer turns on i think its not an original product.  do not purchase,0
Love it helps my hair great....wish it was a bigger bottle for the price though,1
"I wasn't a real big fan of this product. I'm big on whitening my teeth, and I thought the powder mixture combined with the whiten teeth and get fresh breath all in one would end up being a favorite, but that wasn't the case. Actually using it wasn't so bad, but it made my teeth feel really grimy afterwards. I would actually brush my teeth to try to get rid of the feeling after I was done using it, because I couldn't stand what my teeth felt like. Not one I would recommend.
I received this product in my monthly Birchbox.",0
I use this product everyday as my toner I love it. !!,1
"This product is a total knock off! This is not the real Miracurl, the product that I received is different from the one on the pictures. This replica, according to reviews, is not good for the hair and it ruins the hair. I gave to my girlfriend as a birthday gift and I don`t want her to try it, since it may burn her hair.
I have been a prime member of amazon for almost 3 years now, and honestly after this ridiculous mistake I will definitely cancel it. This is not a cheap product for you to be playing with your customers like that.
I would really like Amazon`s response to this very serious issue.
Attached to this review there are two pictures that show that the design is different, also the product is lighter than the official one.",0
Skin turned red and had stinging sensation after use. Also the content smelled like urine.,0
"I loved this wand at first. Then it suddenly stopped working. I reached out MULTIPLE times to get it replaced under the warranty (I purchased this item from sephora which is an authorized reseller) and I have not received a single response. The phone number they have listed does not include an area code, they have not answered several of the emails or facebook messages I have sent. This is quite possibly the worst customer service experience I have ever had.",0
gorgoeus bronze highlighter. I use it in the summer for a pretty glow,1
"Was heading on a tropical vacation where only ""reef-safe"" sunscreens (aka mineral sunscreens) were allowed. I'd already accepted I'd be ""fresh faced"" for the trip (aka not my typical foundation/concealer comfort level), but was not looking forward to the greasy face regular sunblocks always give my oily skin, or the white mime-face from mineral sunscreens. (Plus, chemical sunscreens always seem to make me break out afterward, even Neutrogena ones.) I found Coola Matte Tint on a blog reviewing mineral sunscreens and thought the BB cream aspect of it might make it the perfect thing...  Was it? Well, mostly, yes.

The coverage was not as concealing as I would have preferred, but it definitely helped even skin tone and make me look more polished/smooth, so I'll take what I can get. Plus, no zinc-y mime-face! (Although I am light-to-fair, so I can't speak for anyone deeply tanned, or darker skinned.)

The absolute best part, though, was the matte finish. It's amazing. It's a pretty thin liquid, a la tinted moisturizer, but has a super silky-powdery feel on the skin. I wore my regular moisturizer under it b/c I had read Coola felt a little drying (good tip, btw, even for oily girls) and was STILL crazy matte. Victory!!

Even after hours in the hot sun, and reapplying several times on top of whatever was still there, I was shocked (pleasantly) at how good it looked at the end of the day. And not a single break-out after a 5 day trip, which is unheard of for me.

I just bought one for a close gf going on her tropical honeymoon next month, so I definitely recommend it.",1
it may be an old Essie nail polish because it chips and comes off too easily from nails,0
Reorder. Like this product,1
Good,1
"I used this last summer for my trip to Europe. It completely melted off of my face with sweat and did not keep my makeup put. I was hoping to use this so I would not have to carry facial sunscreen as well as a setting spray in my backpack. It disappointed me and only lasted one week out of my three week trip. I did not re-apply each day, so it should not have run out that fast. Please don't waste your money. This product is not worth your savings.",0
Good if you're looking for a medium hold.,1
Way too dark far me. Can't use it even for contouring.  Packaging was nice though. My other bronzers make better contour shades.,0
"I ordered this product just three weeks ago and according to Amazon, I am still within the window to return it.  It didn't give me the great results it promised especially for the price.  The tips and filters have to be replaced too often which also contributes to it costing too much to maintain.  You are supposed to be able to return it within 30 days if not satisfied, but I just got an email stating they would only issue a refund if it hasn't been used. DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!! The Dermawand does much better, is less expensive and you don't have to buy replacement parts.",0
Ordered by mistake returned,0
"I bought this in the shade ""Bougainvillea"". The packaging arrived broken, the pan was not glued onto the compact. Good thing the product itself was safe. It's a pretty sheer blush, you'll need to layer and layer it to get a nice color. One swipe is not enough for me, it looks like nothing. Not really happy with this one.",0
"love it, love the light citrus smell,, leaves hair clean, shiny,,,can use every day...",1
"I am so glad I tried this Bio-Ionic Retex System, Japanese Hair Straightening System... It was so easy to use with an amazing result. Just folow the simpole steps on how to do it and in one snap you will have the best hair ever straight and not even dry. I would definitely recommend this to all my friends...... The shipping as promise came on time.  Amazing .!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
Like it and it's safe for ur skin.  Apply very thin amt to center of face.  Little goes a long way.  Corrective stick for coverage is a needed bonus to get with it for cover-ups.,1
moving on from Mario,0
Works great.  This diffuser fits onto my T3 no problem and works great. Glad I bought this instead of buying a whole new hairdryer with diffuser.,1
"This spray is lightweight, with perfect feathery hold. It makes your hair smell unbelievable. You'll feel like you're on an exotic vacation everyday.",1
Very small in size for the hefty price. There are many more products that are very nice for much less.,0
"Pretty good stuff. Its going a lot further than I had expected. The smell when your lathering up is ok, but once you get out of the shower it smells really good",1
I have tried this in the past and got no better results than with other polishes that say they make your nails stronger but actually don't work. I prefer nutranail 5-7 day growth aloe formula plus Healthy Hoof..,0
"I've used cheap shaving cream and $5 shaving cream, but this works best.  You lather it up in the bowl it comes in and stick it on.  It doesn't go on thick like a regular shave cream so you can still see your beard lines.  Works great, will stick with this.",1
"When this works consistently it produces fantastic curls.  The problem with this product is that it pulls the hair a lot, you cannot tell how hot it is before you put your daughter's hair in this thing, running the risk of burning the hair.  Lastly, the first time I curled my 11 year old's full head of hair with this, the iron would just lose heat.  It still beeped as if it was curling the hair and beeped when the hair was ready, but the hair would be uncurled  when it came out of the curling chamber-very frustrating.",0
"i bought this in advance of need, i now need it and it will not spray at all. it is my 2nd can, liked the 1st one.  how can i return this for a can that sprays?",0
Used twice so far love it ! the different settings  are great heat high medium or low . Also has flow button high or low . There is a cool shot too that works perfectly and it is hard to push so you don't accidentally hit it when drying which I use to hate on cheaper models . My locks feel smooth and drying time was cut in half ! The only downside is the heaviness why I took a star off  . For personal use or for those who have less than 3 clients a day you should be fine but anymore than that will be a work out . It is good quality like most ghd products and I love how there's a warranty if needed!,1
"Doesn't feel as strong as the ones that came with the device. Fyi.  If you have certain diseases or disorders that cause excess hair, it will only slightly slow the growth.  Been using regularly for over 3 years and still have to shave every single day!  I'm still hoping that one day it will work for me.",0
"It didn't offer me the extra close shave I heard others talk about, but it works well and didn't irritate my skin at all. The razor is easily disassembled for cleaning and blade replacement, and it's very sturdy and solid. I haven't had any issues so far, and don't expect any in the future, either.",1
"I bought this after trying another Cargo lipstick--just wanted another color.  This brand is fantastic...the color
lasts; it's soft on the lips, not too bright/not too pale.  If you haven't tried this brand of lip product before, you're
missing out.  It's really different.  Well worth the money.",1
leaves your skin glowing!!!!,1
"LOVE this curling iron for my long thick hair. My hair does not hold curls well, but hot tools and lots of product make it work. Only problem I have with this is that this is my second one. The metal on the handle started to rip and it bends so I can't open the clasp. Other than that, love it.",1
Love this color,1
it's ok,1
I use this on face daily and just love it. It really helps with my acne. My skin is nice and clear too!,1
"purse size jar, toooo small",0
This stuff helps camouflage thinning hair. Nice to be able to go out in sunshine without a hat!,1
"This has been a godsend during the super dry winter. My skin has been uncomfortably itchy and I get tired of slapping on moisturizer constantly. I've even been able to apply it after makeup when I start to dry out. I've sprayed it in my hair too, when the dryness caused static.

I removed one star because I don't LOVE the scent. I'm not a huge floral scent lover, but I recently started using Garnier's rose water line and really enjoy it, so it IS possible. This definitely has the old lady rose scent, but it doesn't linge and the product works so well it's worth it.",1
"It broke after a couple of uses, air is coming out of the wrong place and not dispensing any fibers. Too much money for nothing",0
I need something water resistant for my workouts than does not transfer into the towel and this one does the job. Also it is very easy and quick to apply. You have to be careful and apply sparingly so that it doesn't clump on the areas you put too much,1
"One of the main reasons i got this brush were because the reviews were so great. My hair is fine but it lacks volume so needless to say i was really excited when i got this. The first time i tried it, i got it tangled it my hair a few times and i noticed alot of my hair has fallen out and even more was stuck on the brush. I figured i had been using it wrong so i gave it a few more chances. The second time around, i was able to achieve some volume that i was happy with so i decided to keep it even though the volume didn't last for more than a few minutes. So the next time i decided to use some product on my hair to maintain the volume. However, i noticed the bristles in the brush were severly bent and many had fallen out. There was also some discoloring that i figured to be from overheating? Not to mention every time i used that thing (which was only 3 times mind you) alot of my hair fell out. The results weren't as spectacular as promised. i  didn't notice a big difference in my hair. Overall, im really disapointed because this would have been a big life saver for someone like me who cant operate a round brush and a blow dryer at the same time. I guess ill never have kim kardashian hair :(",0
"This is a game changer. The only thing I would say is if I could buy again - I'd spend the extra $ and get the full sized one. It's a bit small in my hand but it makes your face feel so clean and as a bald guy, I buzz my head a lot and it makes it more even after using this on my scalp too.",1
I was very unhappy with this flat iron that I bought for my granddaughters. I bought two and they are supposed to be professional irons. I have been a Spa owner and stylist for 39 years and these do not close all the way on the hair and the hair catches in them. I returned both.,0
"It seems to be helping with my thinning hair, but it is very drying.",0
This made my hair have a strange texture. I did not like it.,0
"I've been buying Glytone lotion for years and this is the first time the product had a really bad smell.  I think it might have gone bad, maybe stored in a hot place.  Unfortunately, I didn't open the product for over a month as I still had some left and so when I did I was no longer able to make a return.  Overall, I recommend the Glytone products, but I would caution to try it when you get it immediately in case it has expired.",0
It's not meet my expectaion,0
"for the price, this should be similar to owning a professional flat iron. Since I have a lot of hair, I took the advice of my stylist and tried it on small portions of my hair but it did little to improve my experience. I read the reviews but perhaps the people who bought it have thin hair and less volume.",0
how does anyone curl their lashes with this - I thought it would be a great item but boy was I wrong - it was expensive too for a curler - not work it,0
The shipping was very fast.,1
"It's cheaper on here(I think?), works(doesn't take off lashes with any oily residue etc) and lasts awhile. Will buy on here again!",1
"Pretty color and good coverage.  It wears very well, too.",1
"I love this product - a deoderant that works in hot, humid weather - rather than the more common anti-perspirants that can be found everywhere that I will not wear.  Well done Aramis!",1
"Disappointed,it is not worth the price I pai for .",0
"Used 2 jars hoping that my turkey neck would improve with continued use, but no luck for me.  My skin feels dry and tight, but not in a good way.  My neck appearance is the same if not worse.",0
Not very foamy.,0
To dry. Very hard to apply because the liner was very dry.,0
"I purchased this product with the hope that it could help with my thinning hair problem. The shampoo and conditioner left my scalp with a ""tingly"" feel, but the conditioner did not work very well.  My hair was knotty after rinsing, and was frizzy after styling (which is not typical).  After one week of daily use (of all three products), I had to stop using them.  After seven days, it appeared to me that I was losing more hair than ever.  I'm not sure that these products were the cause of the increased loss, however I did not want to take a chance.  After stopping use, I noticed less hair accumulating in the drain after my shower.  I've read some posted reviews where purchasers reported that these products worked for them....but that certainly was not my experience.  Therefore, I could not recommend them.",0
"Very disappointed after all of the hype. Offers minimal lubrication compared to Taylor of Old Bond St, so much so that my face was a mess of nicks after using it (not my first rodeo by any stretch of the imagination). Also smells...off somehow.",0
not worth it,0
"I hated this. I only give it two stars because it went on well.  But the color was ugly on me.  I have ivory skin with cool undertones and normally blue-pinks and lavenders look great on me.  But this made my hands look corpse-like.  It is not really metallic--there's a slight shimmer in the bottle, but it's barely detectable on the nails.  It took three coats to cover and went on like a cream.  It's almost white, with a gray-lavender cast.  I took it off right away  I put on Hudson instead, which is a metallic lavender which is much more wearable.",0
"With only a life span of 5 months, this hair dryer is not worth what I paid for it. Very disappointing.",0
"I stopped using it as it appears as dirt on the face
The color is not a match for my skin",0
Smells so good !!,1
Best mousse out there! Leaves hair full if body without stiffness.,1
This product smells great! I got both the shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo smells floral and works up into wonderful suds. It keeps my hair volumized and clean! The conditioner smell like vanilla and provides lots of volume without making my hair greasy or weighing it down!,1
this was a gift for my sister and she loved it,1
"Streaky no matter how I premoisturize, mix with other lotions, and rub it in...",0
"I have natural curly fine hair, works great for me. Need that extra hold.",1
"I went to the Macy's to find my shade, and unfortunately had to beg to try a sample, which is not Dermablend policy as far as I am aware.  I bought the face makeup, the body makeup, and the setting powder.  I tried it out at work today, and was very disappointed because after 5 hours it completely rubbed off and was gone, just like Revlon ColorStay for half the price.  I did not rub it, only patted my oily face gently throughout the day as the oil emerged, but still, for the price I might as well have bought a 10$ long wearing makeup.  I am hoping to try the leg and body makeup tomorrow and hope that it performs better.  I truly wish there were a makeup available for oily faces that doesn't just  melt off in a few hours.  Suggestions are welcome!",0
this didn't help with my self tanning stuff. I use Tanceuticles which is the best  but I applied on elbows ankles etc as directed and I still got patches of dark spots....,0
Love it,1
"I love this product and the price. However, the pump in the shampoo bottle was broken so that is frustrating.",1
"Did not darken lashes...some length but I noticed also that the amount of lashes that  I was losing, was drastic! Would not recommend.",0
"I have to assume this item is counterfeit bc it is so crappy. I love the Stila brand, and bought this from Amazon to save money over Sephora. The color is very light and patchy. I have a Maybeline liquid liner that is much higher quality than this. Mine also had the gold text mentioned in another review.",0
Simply fantastic... better than expected,1
Tiniest lotion bottle ever. Great scent but very disappointed in the size for the price.,0
"Product streaks when applied, even second coat and I use OPI base coat.  Also this particular bottle has little black flecks in polish.  Need to send this back to Amazon, but not sure how to do it yet",0
EXCELLENT PRODUCT,1
"I have purologies conditioner which I absolutely love, so I was expecting a similar type of feel.  This leave in condition falls up short.  I have hair that is about 4 inches below the shoulder.  I've tried this product several times.  It feels very sticky in my hands and when dried can leave my hair feeling stiff and I never put on more than 1 pump.  My hair is no easier to comb out than if I didn't use the product at all.

My advice to people is to buy their regular conditioners and don't waste your money on this product!  They need to go back to the drawing board on this one.",0
waste of money and space. Peeled off and looked awful. Hard to put on evenally. Waste of money I think personally!! Thanks,0
The shampoo was discoloured and smelled bad,0
Color not as shown. It is more of a brown than a red.,0
I like this product....very moisturizing...not greasy..,1
Drying,0
excelente,1
"Scent doesnt last long without turning reeds over weekly, best for small spaces with low ventilation. I have to keep turning the reeds the other direction every few days in order to get a scent that is detectible in my master bath. Pretty disappointed, considering the investment over over $100! I contacted the company and they sent me a new bottle of oil, but it didn't help.",0
"I had very high expectations of this product because of the reviews and price but I was very disappointed. This product does has two positive things. 1. It smells good. 2. It gives texture to your hair. That is all, hence the review. I have very fine hair that becomes very oily after one day so I really needed this to work for me. This product did not work for me at all. I used it the next day and it did nothing for the oil in my hair. It did add some texture but not enough to give it a pick me up. It's sad because its so expensive. I will go back to my 8.99 Batiste dry shampoo, which works much much better than this expensive product on my second and third day hair. I would not recommend for my type of hair.",0
"I've used this (expensive) lotion for the past year at the recommendation of my dermatologist, and it generally has been effective for me.  But, I'm now shopping around for a substitute because the packaging is terrible and the quantity of lotion in each (expensive) bottle is erratic.  Because it's only one ounce and the container is opaque and cannot be opened, you have NO warning, by weight or visual, as to when the (expensive) bottle is empty; the pump just comes up dry.  You can't open the container to check to see how much of this (expensive) lotion might remain or to get the last of the (expensive) product out of the bottom.  I've had an (expensive) bottle last anywhere from six weeks to one week.  My surmise with the (expensive) ""one week"" bottle was that the pump mechanism had malfunctioned, but, as you can't open it up to see, so who knows?  And, oh yeah, did I mention that this lotion is expensive?",0
"Not a good or bad review... Just kind of ambivalent. It doesn't add a whole heck of a lot to the shave that I can tell. I usually add a few drops to my TOBS lather... I tried applying it directly to my face and massaging it in... Again.. MEH... It didn't prep my hairs any better than my normal routine and it was a PAIN to get off my hands.

Also, anyone using a cartridge razor, I would NOT recommend this. It gummed up my DE razor so I can only imagine what it would do to a cartridge...",0
Good coverage not greasy drys quickly on skin stays all day has brilliant nice color and I didn't break out !,1
Did nothing for my hair dryness & had the smell of cheap perfumed drugstore brand conditioners.,0
"This is a really good hair dryer.  Definitely much better than drug store purchased ones.  When you pay $200 for a hair dryer, you expect them to last a good amount of time.  Mine broke after 1 year and 8 months.  I was so disappointed.  I use it only once a week.  For such a high price, it should last much longer than that.  So disappointed and will not purchase this again.  I am looking into hair dryers that have at least 2 year warranty.  Sooooooo disappointing to break down less than two years while paying a really high price.  Will not purchase this again for sure.",0
It does not work right because it does not clamp all the way. I didn't realize this until I used my friend's who has the exact same kind and her's worked so much better than mine.,0
"It smells good, gals dig it, no funk residue.  I had a hot stylist sell it to me, and now I'm hooked on it.  At least I was duped into buying a good product.",1
"A friend had bought me a bottle for a gift and since then, I have always wanted to get another bottle but never got around to it. With another purchase, I got the pump bottle. It is great.",1
"I purchased this last year and used it faithfully. I really invested a lot of time in using it and saw absolutely no difference. I meet all the requirements: dark hair, light skin, shaved, etc. I emailed Tria within the time frame for returns and was told that it was too soon to see results and to keep at it. So, I continued to use the Tria and still saw no results. When I emailed Tria again I was told that it was past the time frame for returns. I mentioned that I had emailed them within the time frame, but they said that no where in my email did I ask for a refund, so I am stuck with it. What a waste of a lot of money!!! Please, please do not make the same mistake I made!!",0
Just got it and will update my review after a month or so...but so far this is a good product.,1
Does not work save your money! Will not let me submit  a zero rating .,0
I didn't like the smell of this product.,0
I love this hair dryer.  They have them at my gym and I liked it so much that I bought my own.  My mom even ended up buying one!,1
"There were so many good reviews I was very much looking forward to using this product. I tried and tried but it does not work. It does absolutely nothing! I am thinking maybe I received a bogus jar of this product. Very sad that I tried for too long. Now, it's too late to return  this product. I must be that one person that this product has no effect. :(",0
"This ""Babyliss"" curl is a knock off! Buyer beware!! I ordered 1 from a few different sellers and they were all imitations.",0
"This is a well worth your money!!! It has the power and dries just like those hair dryers from the salon, but it doesn't use all the power (watts).  I love it!",1
Amazing face cream. I have extremely sensitive skin. This lotion does not burn my skin.,1
"Know that item is listed as "".35 ounce"".  BUT item received is only 0.04 oz = 1.1g.

Same product and size that I had before but perhaps description needs to be corrected!",1
"this got such great reviews so I bought it for my son hoping it would be the answer to his acne. two bottles were finished, and there was absolutely no difference at all. I would not reorder.",0
"For people like me who would look like French poodles even after using traditional perms, this product is excellent.  Humidity resistant, really tames curls, maybe even a little too much.  I love it",1
Precise what I expected and it arrived as it was advertised. Nice to use it in phase of life. Recommend it.,1
Works well.  It doesn't weigh my hair down and it's not sticky or anything.  Although I don't like the smell :(,1
Noticeably better than washing alone.,1
"This is EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL eyeshadow!!!  I love it!!! The only thing...I used that little bottle of liquid primer that comes with it.. I put a drop of it on
my finger tip and then applied the eyeshadow just like it said...and somehow I think I got some of the primer liquid in my eyes...and that was the worst irritation I've ever experienced!!!  It was awful!!  My eyes were a little red and itchy the next day. Because I've always wanted this and I LOVE the color....I tried the eyeshadow without the primer...and that worked for me.  It looked beautiful and it didn't irritate my eyes.  Just don't used the liquid primer that comes with it.",1
Love this brand. Ordered through Amazon to save money over salon but came & shampoo exploded everywhere in the package. Love the product.,0
"doesn't last long and not worth the money. If you have very thinning hair, try something else. You would have to pour a bucket of this on your hair if you want results and you'll just be wasting your money because it will look fake and gone within hours due to sweat and humidity.",0
They item is very hard to use and it does pinch.,0
"Ad says ""Healthy"" fragrance (blackberry and bergamot) but a different scent and brand (""Moist"") was sent.",0
"I have been using the NuFace Trinity Facial trainer kit with the wrinkle reducer attachment for a few weeks now. Best results take up to 60 days but I will give my best early impression now since I need to leave a review within 30 days in exchange for testing out the product.
This kit includes the facial toning device, wrinkle reducer attachment and a tube of primer gel. There are a couple of instruction booklets and the charger cable and cradle. I am impressed with the quality of the device itself. It is very well made and the curved design fits well both in your hand and on the contours of your face.
Bonus points from me for being dual voltage for use overseas and for the charger having retractable prongs for travel or storage.
I have pretty average combination skin and have had no adverse reaction to using this on a regular basis.
I was especially concerned about the red light wrinkle attachment but it actually feels very pleasant during treatment - just a nice, warm feeling when pressed against your skin. It is not necessary to use the primer gel with the wrinkle attachment, which makes it easy for me to stick to a routine of using just before bed. I keep the device next to my bed and use it while catching up on Netflix or listening to music. There is a built in timer so you don't have to watch the clock when using the device with either attachment.
It's too early to see what long term improvements there may be but I do like using this device. It makes me feel as if I am pampering my face and I like being able to do this in the privacy of my own home at my own convenience.
To get the best results, you need to make a serious commitment to using this as directed several times as week. But once I got comfortable with how the device works, it really has been easy to keep up with my routine.
I am a cynic when it comes to something like this but my skin certainly feels better than it did before. But the real test will be whether or not I see any significant improvement in the next 30 days. While this is a quality device that feels luxurious to use, unless it delivers the results it promises, it will not be worth the cost.
So stay tuned since I will definitely be back to update on my progress...",1
"The curling iron works great, but after 2 years, just stopped clamping for no reason.  I don't use hair spray so there's no rust.  I haven't dropped it, it just won't tighten any longer.  2 years doesn't seem like a good lifespan to me.",0
My wife likes it,1
This dryer is trash. I am so sorry I missed the deadline to return it. It blows cold air even when on high heat. It takes forever to dry my hair. Waste of money. My cheap blow dryers do a much better job. Major disappointment.,0
Love this cleansing brush! It's really helped prevent acne breakouts and even out my skin tone!,1
cleans up the make-up residuals completely. Don't make my skin dry. love it,1
"I wasn't sure I liked the smell when I first got it (I'm very picky), but by the second day I was hooked.  I'm now addicted to the smell of Mustela products.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!",1
Good product.,1
"This stuff is a huge pain in the ass, And the hold doesn't last long on top of that. It's extremely thick and waxy and is difficult to apply. My hair has extreme resistance to this stuff and it loses its hold in just 2-3 hours. Useless. The only good thing about it is it doesn't make your hair rock hard when you use it.",0
"The texture is great; the color is nice, but not bright enough for  me.",0
off to a good start!  THANKS!,1
I love this perfume! I get compliments EVERY SINGLE TIME I wear it. Definitely my favorite.,1
It's just hair spray no big deal and the worst part about it is the sprayer did not work right so it went into the trash and I bought regular hair spray,0
Excellent service. Love this product!,1
Too oily,0
Product made hair too soft to work with,0
"I've been using the night cream (a bit of a misnomer as it is more of a serum) nightly for just over a week. While the dark circles under my eyes haven't disappeared I do see a slight lightening of the circles. Others mentioned a glow after using the Vichy Night Cream. I have had the same experience. I will review the cream again after 4 weeks of nightly use. The instructions say that results will be noted in 4 weeks. I will also post before and after pictures. This product is pricey, but I haven't really experienced another product like it and if it really does lighten the circles it might be worth it.",1
Excellent traveling abroad. Clips leave dents in my fine hair but pins work great.,1
Good transaction. No complains,1
Thanks. It's good item but not perfect.,1
Lightweight and powerful. Dryes my hair in no time! Good purchase. I recommend it 100%.,1
"I somehow thought it would make my skin look super glowy and it does its job but i think maybe my skin tone and this highlighter don't get along too well, but overall I think this is a good highlighter!",1
"Like many others, I also received what I suspect to be fake Strivectin; it was so different from the other 2 tubes that I had used. The consistancy, color, and scent were all different. When I very closely compared the tubes, they were different too, with small variations in the words, pink stripes, etc. and yes, it was more drying, not as creamy and just did not feel as nice. What made me suspicious though was that when it arrived, there was no box, no brochure like the previous tubes.

Soooo....I called Strivectin. Weeks ago I might add. I began by asking if they had any information on any possible fake products being sold. I was told to always buy the products from an authorized distributor (if it's being offered for sale, how am I suppose to know if it's an authorized distributor and there was no answer for that question). I gave the rude and unhelpful lady the code from the tube and asked her if she could check to make sure it was an authentic code number at least. She took the number and said she would call me back (gave her my name and phone number). Days later I called them again and asked why I hadn't received a return call. The lady I spoke to that time was at least pleasant. She took my information again and while on the phone she said she was e-mailing another department to get the answer expedited for me and I should have a call back the following day. It has since been 3 weeks. I know ED said that he got all kinds of information from them. I guess I spoke to the wrong folks there!  If the formula has changed and this is what it will be from now on, JUST SAY SO STRIVECTIN. Tell all of us who call!! If it will be sold as just a plain tube without a box and brochure then tell us that too!! As it is, we don't know what we have. FAKE OR AUTHENTIC??? They should at least know their own product codes. I WOULD LIKE AN ANSWER FROM THEM. AFTER ALL, CUSTOMERS AT LEAST DESERVE ANSWERS. WE ARE THE ONES KEEPING THEM IN BUSINESS, so I expect a return call as promised.",0
The smell is horrible and my face looks like a ghost. Does not run in very well. Dries too fast. Not a fan of this product at all.,0
"Love the quality, but find that it's unbalanced and a little heavy.  Not portable but not too big either.  I recommend this though it dries my long hair quick and leaves it healthier than a regular blow dryer!  Use the cool setting to set your hairstyle after it dries and blow in the direction of the hair to close the cuticle. Leaves my hair smooth.",1
didn't do anything for me and a few spots I tried it on.,0
I love this perfume...long lasting great scent ! I would have rated it five stars but it arrived with a bent top which makes it very hard to open !,1
"I am concerned with the date merchandise was manufactured ,read review s after ordering product",1
Both my 16 year old daughter and I love this face cream. We have tried several UV face creams and this is definitely the best.,1
I have purchased this product before and loved it. This time though it was more of a cream texture rather than a paste and didn't seem to work as well. Compared the two and they don't even look like they are made the same.,0
Didn't match description - it has a powdery smell,0
"I buy from Amazon all the time, and have never written a review because until now I have not found a product that has disappointed me so much.  I purchased the Silk'n SN-008 Flash&Go All-Over Hair Removal Handheld Device and used it as directed for 10 months, changing the head as needed.  I kept using it every 2 weeks instead of reducing the frequency because I was extremely disappointed with the results.  Basically, there are no results.  I still have hair in the areas being treated, just like I did before.  After 10 months of not seeing any results, I am giving up and no longer wasting my time.

Save your $299 and put it towards laser hair removal!!!",0
"I have dry skin so I must have tried every hand cream on the planet and so far this is the best.  The Dead Sea minerals really get absorbed into your skin and keep it moist and healthy looking.  This is the first winter ever that my hands have looked lovely with no hangnails or dry spots.  Ahava hand cream will be on my dresser forever.  Thanks, Amazon, for offering this great product.",1
"Wet dog, that's the lingering odor, and let me tell you, it ain't pleasant first thing in the morning!  I got this product through the L'occitane website during their holiday gift box deals, and had high hopes for it as I love their almond hand cream.  But, this lathers nicely and smells like almonds out of the bottle...as soon as you lather it up, though, it turns into the most awful wet dog smell.

Three bottles of this stuff are now in my garbage...pity, because their products are not cheap.",0
It came to me used and continued turning off! For an expensive flat iron it did not impress me at all!,0
"I am a regular user of Paul Mitchell products.  Not only does it meet my expectations, but I appreciate this company's anti-cruelty stance, i.e., not testing their products on animals.  I try to purchase products which meet this standard, and which also gives good results when used.",1
This is not waterless. It is more like a lotion that a soap. The only way to remove this from your face is to wash it off with water.,0
"Great product, beautiful colors. Make sure you apply two coats, makes a huge difference.",1
"Hello, sheving gel was broken pump please send the new pump.",0
This products did nothing for me but make my skin red.  I used it as directed and had no changes to my skin.,0
Very good coverage and a little goes a long way! Don't use to much or it will look cakey! Definitely blend out well! I like the full coverage,1
I love jane iredale makeup but not wild about the cleansing system,0
I love this product.  It gives just the right amount of exfoliation with environmentally friendly microbeads.  It is gentle on the skin and leaves the skin feeling clean and fresh.,1
I was disappointed. It was supposed to have conditioner in it. It is hard to apply.,0
"I have started using cream blusher - believe it works better for the more 'mature' lady . Great product , stays on all day & a soft but natural color . Very flattering product , I will continue to buy .",1
smells great! relaxing scent very clean ! bubbles up great! love love love it!,1
There're was not enough liquid for the pads they were dry but I loved how the first 3o pads were soaked and it helped my face so much not worth 70 for the dryer pads,0
"I discovered this product through my best friend and absolutely love it!!  I have a wide part due to thinning hair from having had low iron and this fills it in beautifully and naturally.  Everyone thinks my hair grew back!  It's coming back slowly, but takes time.  I didn't know what to do and when my friend put it on me and I was wowed!  Thank god for this product!!!  It takes seconds to apply after I wash my hair and I feel so confident and happy now about the way I look.  It stays on until you wash your hair again.  GREAT PRODUCT!!!!",1
"I love this using this after a hard days work, specially on hot summer days. It leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed and it smells great!!!!",1
"Overall good curling wand. It gets super hot and has adjustable heat settings. I still need to master the perfect beach wave with it!! The glove is kinda weird, useful, but weird feeling.",1
works better than it smells,1
"Moisturizing, yes. But after only a few weeks, it smells like a two week old bottle of water. I will be throwing it away.",0
"Still questioning how to properly use this. Doesn't do anything to my hair. I have medium wavy hair, medium to thin. Nada",0
I absolutely love this tool. I was a forever CHI fan before I was told about this at the salon. it makes amazing curls and makes it straight without the burn smell.,1
I have purple hair and this unfortunately leaves white flakes in my hair. I even tried brushing it out with a boar brush and the white flakes still won't disappear.,0
"I am glad some people have had the results they wanted.
I started using this product in April and I have not seen the results one would expect.
Eyebrows are still thin and some areas nothing.
I can not recommend this product.
Have read applying Castor Oil, Coconut Oil or Olive Oil
will give you the growth desired and you will pay a whole
lot less for these items.",0
All of the products are heavily scented.  I wish I would have known this before buying since my family is extremely sensitive to fragrances. I can't use it on my infant (for whom it was purchased) because it breaks him out in a mild rash. :(,0
"I've tried this brand shaving cream with different razors, amounts, pre-shave products etc and find it to provide far less comfort and shaving quality than a can of drug store shaving gel properly lathered. Perhaps you have to be a shaving elitist with little concern for value to appreciate the product.",0
It blends very well and feels wonderful.,1
Good product,1
I like this hairspray because it is light and not sticky feeling on your hair. It holds without being stiff. I would recommend this product.,1
"All skin is different, so maybe it will work for somebody, but it didn't work for me. The texture is nice, silky without being oily, not thick or too creamy... so it felt nice on my skin, but in the end it just didn't do anything to help with dark spots. I ended up going with a Rx hydroquinone cream and that has made the difference, and costs less than many of these correcting/dark spot creams.",0
"Helps give my hair a little boost, but I felt like it looked dirty sooner.  Still, the shaping aspect is nice, as I have very limp hair.  On balance, I used it rather than have flat head!  :-)",1
Item as described.,1
"I can t use this thing, no matter how I try to hold it, it just frizzes my hair. I bought an Infinity Pro by conair and that thing really does the job. it's amazing",0
Not pleasant smell,0
"Just OK, not worth the hype or price.  Nyx has better shimmer glosses for a third of the price.",0
"Used chi for 10 years, finally it broke. Was looking for the same one but did not get. But this is even better. Heats up fast, and has temperature control.",1
"I'm not impressed.  It showed up without a top.  Not a big deal, but the product is 'soft'.  I have fine short hair and wanted something that would add texture and definition.  This isn't it.  This like a light hair spray.",0
The rollers are too large.,0
Excelent Product,1
Product works well. However it came partially opened and I lost a good amount of the product. Was going to return it but got lazy so dealt with the loss.,0
This product is indeed very messy.....within minutes of it drying it starts to flake off.  Would not buy again because I really don't see a difference at all.,0
"I bought this curling iron after my other Hot Tools stopped working.  I thought I'd give it another try because I actually liked the way this iron worked.  I use my iron maybe 3 times a week.  I bought this back in 2015.  Well this one broke too, I'm very disappointed.  I won't be buying another one.",0
"Very gentle toner, no alcohol, no strong fragrance. I use it twice a day as second cleanser. It leaves skin a good clean feeling. Wish it was cheaper though.",1
"I've been using CHI Silk Infusion for several years however this was the first time I purchased thru Amazon.  It arrived in a timely manner and in good condition with no leakage.  It was also priced really well. About 30% lower than local stores.
I have long thick hair which tends to tangle when I wash it. This product is a great detangler and gives your hair the most amazing smell.  It also tames the flyaways really well.
A few months ago, just for the sake of comparison, I tried another product sold in salons that contained an oil from morocco. I used it for a while but came back to this product because it just worked better for my type hair. Also this product is not as heavy and oily as others.
I give it 4 stars because I do feel it could be a little better as a smoothing agent.",1
"Thanks, good product.",1
"I have been using Pureology products for more than eight years and swear by them! However, I do not like this product - it smells bad and the stench lingers for several hours after using the product.",0
It does it's job,1
"Corrective Fluid Makeup for the Face Like Correction Fluid ((White Out))  for Paper

This Vichy Finish covered my skin like that.  In a thick Opal colored blanket.

 I was looking for basic coverage that would hide some of the signs of aging.  I always wear a Natural Looking makeup.  I may be wearing foundation, blush and powder, eyeliner and mascara, but if I go heavy it's on the eyes, not the foundation.  After multiple tries I could not find a way to tone this product down so that I could wear it.  Fortunately I had&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vichy-Puret-Micellar-Cleaning-Solution/dp/B000Q388UK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vichy Puret Micellar Cleaning Solution</a>&nbsp;to get it off.  That latter Vichy product works great.  Soap and water, not so much.

SUMMARY
I was ready for a clown nose after putting this on.  It was just too thick and heavy for me.  BUT that might make it perfect for someone with small scars to hide.

I was looking to hide the signs of aging and for the most part, while this would hide age spots and broken veins, it presents wrinkles in a bad light.  If used around the eyes you are going to hate what it does to those crows feet.  (not me, I tried them on a friend, lol)

Don't Recommend except for special cases.",0
"I have sensitive skin and have used Imperial Classic Pomade, Imperial Fiber Pomade and the Gel Pomade for the past two years with no issues what so ever. I LOVE IMPERIAL! I recently purchased this Imperial Matte Pomade and loved that I could do the messy look when I cut my hair short, versus the other Imperial products that I use when it's longer. (Long hair with pomade in the summer when you live in Arizona, sucks.) The negative thing about this Matte Pomade is that after 3 days of use, it made me break out in painful bumps all around my hair line and on my scalp. It's no big deal, I still love this line, I just won't be using the matte formula anymore. It washes out great, just like the other products.

I have thick curly hair and when I use the typical classic pomade from the barber, it's just like Vaseline and it doesn't come out. It's gross. I also notice that when I style my hair with the typical barber pomade, way too much hair falls out because I have to tug. With Imperial products, they glide through my hair and straighten it out so that my styles stay in all day until I wash it out at night. Seriously these ARE the best products that I have ever used in my hair and I will continue to buy religiously.",0
Does a nice job of removing old polish. Would recommend this one.,1
Pump sticks when sprayed. Product needs better pump.,1
Doesn't work,0
"I think this is a fake! The packaging is different, it's not very pigmented, and it wipes right off. After all the videos I have watches and all the reviews I have read on this product (not on amazon) there is no way this is right. This product has been a favorite of so many beauty gurus for quite some time now and there's no way this is the same product. Go ahead and just buy this highlighter elsewhere. Don't buy from this seller!",0
"It made my hair feel like it was dirty.
 But it did make it look fuller.",0
I love this cleanser.  Ever since I have started using the Clarisonic brush and cleanser my skin has completely cleared up and I no longer have the need to wear face makeup.  It has a fresh scent and it leaves your skin feeling great.,1
"Top line: A fantastic smell cannot overcome the huge price and lack of effectiveness.

Good: Molton Brown is great at producing quality fragrances, and the Charge Black Pepper is one of their best. Subtle and sensational, anyone that has gotten close enough absolutely loves it.

Bad: I've had better performance out of the dime store travel-size roll-ons. I'm a moderate sweater, and within an hour of applying it, I'm sweating as if I'd gone au naturel. I can't believe they label this is an antiperspirant; I would say it's closer to deodorant, although the scent is understated. Considering the price, the ineffectiveness is inexcusable.

Other: If you are into the Black Pepper smell, you may want to check out Molton Brown's cologne if you get the chance (it is nigh impossible to find at this point).",0
"Great, natural color. Takes a bit of time to build color but looks natural on my very pale skin. I love that I can wash it off and not have that sticky feeling all day. Smells a little bit but not bad at all. Wish there were a bigger size because I go through it all within a week or so (with daily use).",1
"Works great and lasts a long time.  Much longer then can cream.
I would definitely try more of this companies products.",1
"I bought the peach tint.  Have used and loved Clinique's Black honey as very natural looking, but wanted something a bit lighter for summer.  Not quite was I was expecting, more teenager-looking - a bright candy-color peach.  I wasted a good deal of money on something I didn't try first, my bad.  Too baby-faced for a mature woman.  The color didn't last very long, either.  Although there was a heavy vaseline-ish feel to it, my lips were irritated, not moist and soothed.",0
good product.,1
Great product the scent is wonderful,1
"Can never get it to spread evenly, could be the applicator",0
This stuff will change your life,1
Great color because it has an iridescent effect to it.  Perfect for hands and toes.  My Favorite color of all-time and a trusted brand.,1
I would give it five stars but need to use it longer to see if it has longlasting results but so far I really like its plumping effect and the seller is reliable and quick in delivering an authentic product at a lower cost.,1
"Did not get makeup off at all. I live by the bioderma bottled cleanser and would recommend in a heartbeat, but this one did not hit the nail on the head. It mostly smeared makeup around my face and I had to scrub really hard for it to work. Nope nope.",0
Exactly what I expected. Love this color. Had a pedicure with it that lasted almost a month.,1
the smell was not worth the cost ($40); item over priced,0
This is a great product.,1
"Excited about receiving this, but 1st use was awful.  Hair caught and pulled so hard I had to unplug it to get free.  Bristles too soft to hold even fine hair like mine.",0
Works good. The only reason I didn't give five stars was that the color is a little harsh.,1
the only gel nail polish that has actually lasted on my nails for 2+ weeks!!,1
"This lotion is just okay... I found that I only used it once all summer, since it takes a longer while to create a sunless tan (hours) and, unfortunately, the smell isn't very enticing (I've used other sunless tanners in which the scent is less pungent and more pleasant). But again, it does work exactly as it should in terms of leaving you with a nice tan when the process is over.",1
Love it love bliss,1
"I never thought that a decent hairdryer exist in this price range. I have been buying drugstore hairdryer and been replacing each one of them periodically for various reason. I got to try this brand when I stayed at rental apartment in Paris. I had to get it! My hair was smooth, no frizzes, it takes less time to dry my almost waist hair length. I still use hotel hairdryer when I travel and how much difference the result is. This Babybliss Pro is better than decent.",1
"This is a great product; I've been using it for years.  The item that was sent to me however was the melt in sunscreen which I don'r really care for.  I had already thrown away the  packaging, so I'm out of luck with returning the item.  I knew the price was to good to be true;  I'll pay a little more and buy my sunscreen locally from now on.",0
"I have been using L'Occitane soap for as long as I can remember, for good reason.  The incredible scent, Shea butter, and moisturizing properties of this soap are amazing and well worth the money.  Milk, Verbena, Lavender are all great choices.  Pure indulgence at a reasonable price.",1
Didn't work for me. Too expensive for so little amount.,0
"My order arrived quickly and branding on can looks legit, but product was a dissapointment. Does not smell much like the cologne or the aftershave. Not sure what it's supposed to smell like. Not something I'd buy again if it were $1 a can.",0
They tell me  it would clear my acne and white heads up and it's been &agrave;lmost a month since am using it and the conditon of my face hasn't been improve instead it gets worse am disappointed,0
Love it.,1
Was disappointed in scent did not reflect the lemon grass and sage I know from Bliss products,0
"This product is difficult to apply, stained my clothes and was difficult to remove - even after scrubbing in the shower.",0
"This product works well for doing what it is suppose to do.  However, it smells just awful.",0
Love this brand of makeup. I docked 1 star because it was darker than expected.,1
There seems to be a significant chunk of product missing.,0
"I bought this product a few weeks ago and have used it as directed. I wasn't expecting a miracle product and working at a beauty store I know things take time to work. However, I feel as though it's doing absolutely nothing. I got it because I have minor milia and the product said it helps with that. I don't notice any sort of change in that department or any change at all around the eye area. I feel as though I wasted my money.",0
The formula seems to have changed. It is too heavy on the hair now and doesn't control the frizz like it used to.,0
"Ive been using this for almost 1 month now.  Many times face crmes irritate my skin so I have to stop using them. This crme did not irritate  not even the sensitive under-eye area.  It is very rich so a little goes a long way.  It absorbs fairly quickly & does not leave my skin feeling greasy as long as I use a small amount.  If you put on too much, it is kind of sticky/greasy feeling.

It has a light citrusy scent  there is no added fragrance/parfum listed so I assume that is from the ingredients  various citrus extracts and oils.

It doesnt miraculously get rid of fine lines/wrinkles but it does plump them up & make your skin look more youthful.",1
"As a long time user of the combination toner (always purchased at the red door spa), I would have to say this product is counterfeit. The smell, color and packaging are all different than the authentic product that I purchased at the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa.",0
"Paul Mitchell has always put out great hair care products. And usually I only ever get to enjoy them in salons and the occasional travel size offerings in nicer hotels and such. I love the Awapuhi shampoo for its rich texture, its fresh fragrance and the wonderful way it cleans my hair...so clean it squeaks. This item through Amazon feels like an imposter. Its runny, and the scent isn't fresh and invigorating. I will not purchase it again through this seller, but opt for some place local so I can be certain of what I'm getting. Disappointed.",0
... I don't know.. my kid maybe like it..,0
Love my La Roche-Posay products,1
"Love the quality, but find that it's unbalanced and a little heavy.  Not portable but not too big either.  I recommend this though it dries my long hair quick and leaves it healthier than a regular blow dryer!  Use the cool setting to set your hairstyle after it dries and blow in the direction of the hair to close the cuticle. Leaves my hair smooth.",1
"I started using this product with the practice attachment for about a month, and I waited a full week between uses each and every single time. I didn't see any really difference, but I liked it well enough to keep going. After about a month I went up to the next attachment which I believe is called ultra sensitive.

The first few weeks were okay. And then about a week ago I noticed that I have dark lines and discoloration on my face. Now, I initially wondered if the complaints of this might be due to stripping a tan or something. But no... the lines caused by this device on my skin are dark.

Now, when I say I watched the videos, I don't just mean the one that comes with the device. I do mean *all* of the videos. The bad reviews, the everything. And I went it planning not to use the more abrasive attachments, and not to attempt using it too often.

Maybe... maybe for some people using it every 2 weeks could solve the problem. Maybe staying on the practice head (which doesn't do anything at all, really) could be worth it. But for the price?  And the risk of having dark lines and discoloration across your face? It's really not worth it in my opinion.

I didn't pay the full price suggest here. I found it on sale at Nordstrom. And even at $60 less it still seems like a huge risk to take with your face especially if you have sensitive skin.

I did honestly like it after the first use of the ultra sensitive disc. But discoloration with the most sensitive option is absurd.",0
So far not particularly ...,0
"I tried it cautiously on my cheek at first because my skin is sensitive. It dried immediately and rolled off in a way that looked and felt cleaner (despite having already washed my face). Comparing both cheeks' skin, the one with the dermasuri was clearly softer. Brighter? Maybe so. The skin overall did look cleaner, fresher and felt smoother after gentle exfoliation with this. I liked it.",1
didn't work. My hair was a fizzy mess.,0
This wasn't an autentic bottle. My husband has been use it for long time and he knows it perfectly. Disappointed!,0
"SkinMedica is a line of medicated skin care products that previously could only be purchased with a prescription from a plastic surgeon or medical spa. This product, the HA5 Rejuvenating Hydrator, is designed to moisturize, and smooth away fine lines and wrinkles. It has an interesting texture, as it is a really light serum but still feels like a gel, but it provides so much hydration that your skin feels like you've applied a heavy, silky cream. There is a faint, medicinal, clean scent to it. It arrives protected and presented in a heavy display-type box, and a large, sleek silver dispenser that is a bit deceiving, considering there's only 2oz of product within. The Amazon description recommends to wet your fingers before applying to face and neck (though that is not mentioned on the box or product) twice daily, both in the AM and PM. Application is smooth and not greasy, and only a little bit is needed. I have been using it for about a week, and it does give your skin a beautiful glow, and seems to plump up skin so wrinkles disappear. It is definitely a luxury beauty item, with good results.",1
They don't really reduce pores. Just help remove dead skin and keep the face smooth,0
"Avene is the best, this product really has helped clear up my red, dry scaly skin, and it makes it soft & smooth. Great to use at night while sleeping, wake up with great skin. All of their products are the only skin products I use now. Great find!",1
Love it!,1
"I only use Oribe hair products.  After running out of conditioner and shampoo, I had pre ordered, as usual.  I have used this product three times (3).

TNIS IS NOT CONDITIONER BY ORIBE!

I will spend my money on a worthy product.  But, angry that this product has been tampered with.",0
the polish ingredients were separated and needed to be  thinned and mixed before using.,0
"Had high hopes for this product to cure my dry skin. I read all of the reviews and this product was even in Vogue for being good for pregnancy skin. Unfortunately, it turned my dry spots bright red and caused tons of irritation. I used it for a few days then stopped and skin issues cleared up. Perhaps it's because I'm pregnant and my skin is ultra sensitive, but this was not a good product for me. On the plus side, I love the smell and the texture/weight of the cream. Hope it works for someone else.",0
This product is amazing.  I have fine hair and when I use Agadir Argan Oil Volumizing I feel like I have so much hair even though it's fine.  After washing my hair I squeeze a few drops in my hand and then massage it into the roots.  A little goes a long way.  After blowing my hair dry my hair feels very natural and full. It not only works it smells wonderful. I love this product.,1
Just received today. Opened to see the file had been previously used. Bought with good faith as new. Not a deal breaker as shown in the two stars but I didn't pay for used.,0
"I've been using C-curl for a few years and it is THE BEST styling product for curly heads. I've been able to make my routine easy with only this one product for styling, instead of multiples like I used to have. It controls without stickiness or stiffness (unless you use too much) and defines beautiful curls. It's light scent is nice as well. A must have for curly hair!",1
I bought this after getting a facial where they used Bioelements products.  I have dry skin and I find this really helps keep my skin moist and soft.  I use it along with the Bioelements Sleepwear for eyes and it's a great combination together.  I would recommend it.,1
I couldn't get past the fragrance in this.  Couldn't wait to wash it off.,0
I bought this particular brand and type because I thought it would be easy to use. But it is so hard that pressure needed to be applied to make a line. I rolled it out a little to try again but there wasn't any more in it. I donot believe it stated anything in the description of this liner that it said not having so little in the inside of tge tube stick.,0
"I bought 3 of these ... after an entire day of walking around, thinking I had pooped myself, I realized it's actually the smell of this product.  It smells SO bad.",0
"Hate the price for the size.. My fault, that I did not notice the small bottle size.. I have purchased this perfume for years and always got about 3 times that amount for very close to the price.. So beware that you can get this other places way cheaper...",0
Just did not work well.  Product was blotchy and uneven.  I would not buy this again.,0
"My go-to hair product. I have super fine hair and this seems to be the only product that helps give my hair some volume. Sometimes I am unable to find it on the shelves in the stores, so I just buy it here now.",1
Prefer hard water wellness. This didn't do much for me.,0
It is a fake !!! DO NOT BUT IT !!,0
Wife is very happy with the product.,1
dried out my scalp,0
This palette is really cute but the product is low quality. I prefer Urban Decay shadows over most others and the Stila shadows pale in comparison. If you already have the palette just use a primer from a better quality brand. Urban Decay has a great primer and the primer from Too Faced works just as well and is a little easier to use. Cheers!,0
did not see results,0
"I can see why people love this, as it deposits a generous amount of color. Unfortunately, it was not the right color for my hair. It turned my hair pink. My hair has been dyed multiple times in various shades of blonde, but most recently in a more coppery color. I bought this in hopes of bumping me to read as a redhead but it went flamingo pink instead. Good thing I only tested on a small strand. I think it would work well for people who are in the true red-purple range.",0
I love Essie nail polish and this will be a favorite of mine.  It looks like turquoise and that is my favorite color.,1
Don't like it after I spay it my face feels sticky,0
Fooled me with the price. Not worth 75.00,0
"I only condition my hair once a week. Even using this sparingly, it seems to leave my hair flat no matter what hair products I use. If you aren't doing anything else to your hair, the conditioner is great. Leaves your hair soft and stays that way all week.",1
Great idea but pretty harsh on my skin.,0
It doesn't really work well on hereditary dark circles on people with olive skin tones.,0
"After reading all of the rave review, I decided to pull the trigger and spend more than I normally would for mascara. Unfortunately, the stuff clumps and goes on very thick. Wouldn't recommend.",0
BEST CONDITIONER ever!,1
"I've been using his face cream on a nightly basis for the couple weeks and it has helped with my dry skin.  Before using this product, I would usually only use St. Ives apricot cleanser to wash my face -- this would sometimes cause my face to dry out.  Using JB is a nice combo to counteract that by calming my skin.  My face has felt noticeably smoother as a result.

The product doesn't feel oily at all.  It applies clear, and doesn't have any noticeable fragrance.  It does seem a bit expensive for what you get, but it works.",1
"I am very dissatisfied with this product from the standpoint that it wasn't sealed and never did seem to dispense adequately. Not being able to see the inside amount, I couldn't tell whether it contained the full amount indicated. I was very disappointed when after not very many applications, it ran out. I mix it with the non-tinted version of the same product as the color is too strong for my complexion.  (I had bought the non-tinted at my dermatologist's office.)  I had used the NON-tinted for several weeks prior to mixing it and still have some left well after the other ran out, which is strange. Obviously I got much much less of the tinted product though they indicate the same amount in the bottle. I like it, but am hesitant to purchase it again. And it is NOT  cheap.",0
NOT a serum.  I should have read more reviews before buying.  It was definitely a lotion and slightly greasy.  I returned,0
"This is truly one of the best eyebrow gels I have ever tried. However, you need to apply it extremely sparingly or it flakes. Even on my oily skin, this stays put until I wash it off at night. Would give it 5 stars but my main issue is with the container itself. It doesn't matter if you store this product upright or on it's side, once it's opened it tends to leak out from under the top. I've ordered 3 tubes of this, all from different sellers, and the exact same thing happens within the first few days of opening. Doesn't matter how tight you try to recap the tube. Even with that fault it's still my ""go to"" brow gel.",1
"Wished I had purchase the large bottle, smells great!",1
On time and as promised.  Fabulous product,1
"This is NOT the old Remedy shampoo!  My hair feels greasy after I wash it~~VERY disappointed, especially since I contacted the company before buying it!  Won't buy it again!!!!!",0
"This nail polish is, by far, the worst I have ever used. The color was horrible, it chipped after two days and it took about 20 minutes to remove it. I would never buy it again or recommend it to anyone. I don't understand how Amazon can sent it to me through the mail, but I cannot return it because it's considered a ""hazardous"" material.",0
"Owned 5 months, just blew out circuit breaker and product no longer works. Don't buy.",0
"I am a redhead, with fair skin and I have been using Vita Liberate self tanning night moisture mask for about a year now.  I will NEVER not use it.  It's not going to give you a dark tint.  It is a very subtle glow, so if you have dark skin already--it may not do much for you.  It moisturizes well and I just can't say enough great things about it.  I also have sensitive skin, and it did not make me break out at all.",1
My All-Time Favourite Fragrance,1
Very Satisfied with product and price,1
"Worth the money if you can afford it, just make sure you buy the correct Mason Pearson brush for your hair type.  This brush will last a lifetime if you follow the instructions that come with the brush.",1
did nothing for my dark spots.,0
"This cleanser is gentle, effective and a non-toxic alternative to other cleansers. No bad stuff in it! I love it!",1
"Nope. This did absolutely nothing. I'm in my mid thirties so I am starting to see wrinkles in my forehead. I thought this might 'diminish' them as the product claimed, but not so much.  I'm not even going to bother posting the before and after pics I took because I legitimately can't tell which is which.",0
Clumpy after several uses. Will not buy again.,0
"Comptoir Sud Pacifique Vanille Extreme is truly an extreme vanilla fragrance!

With a name like Vanille Extreme, I was worried that this fragrance might be too strong for me, but I found it to be personal and it smells delicious.

Top Notes:  sugar vanilla, heliotrope
Mid and Base Notes:  absolute vanilla, milk

Personally I don't smell any of the heliotrope, but the vanilla and milk combine to make a beautiful caramel scent.  While Vanille Extreme is a pure vanilla scent, it's not extreme in the sense of overpowering.  It doesn't leave a cloud trailing behind me, which is something that I really don't like in a fragrance.

The scent stays with me through lunch.  By the end of the day, it's not as noticeable, but it's still there.

I tend to gravitate toward fruity or floral scents, but now I have to add vanilla to my list.

Vanille Extreme is a great scent when I'm in the mood for something sweet and pure.",1
"I have long hair and this curling iron makes my hair looks funny...it curls in an L shape. My friend who is a licensed hairstylist used the curling iron on me as well and it didn't look the way we liked. The heat is not as strong as my other curlers, even when I turn it on the highest. I would not recommend this product. Now I need to buy another one and a half inch curler =(",0
"Excellent hair dryer.. really smoothes out my hair. Only issue: on the heavy side(though I was warned about this in comments). If you have a lot of hair and it's thick (like mine) it takes quite awhile to blow out. Maybe I'm out of shape, but my arms KINDA hurt after holding this too long! Worth the money though.",1
"It's not my hair, but it helps conceal my hair thinning and loss",1
a very good product,1
Ive been using this for a few weeks.  Im not really a fan.  The grit is WAY too large.  Ive used several other brands of face scrub.  Some have a lot of grit. . . . some not so much. . . but Ive never used one that had such large girt as this.  Its simply uncomfortable.,0
"I was very excited to receive my product but after one use the iron started peeling. So needless to say I have a product that I can not use. I will not buy this product again....I am now searching to purchase another flat iron. Like many, I do not mind paying for good products but I HATE to have to repurchase something so soon.",0
"Having a Father and two older brothers that went completely bald by the age of 20, I was conscious about my hair from a very young age. Over the years I have literally tried just about every shampoo, conditioner, styling product and supplement on the market. With Revivogen, 5% Rogain Foam, 1mg daily of Finasteride and Aveda Grooming Clay (for daily styling) I have finally found the perfect combination in fighting hair loss. At age 35, my hair is finally back to being just as thick as when I was 16 (full head of hair). I even use Rogaine on my temples and frontal hair line and it's always worked very well for me (initial shedding phase takes patience, don't give up!).

As others have mentioned, this product does dry out he scalp a little bit, so be sure to use Nizoral once or twice a week to fight dandruff (it's also good for battling hair loss). My Wife tends to have thinning hair in her upper scalp region and it gets really bad when she uses store brands (diluted garbage and is sure to contribute to hair loss). Since she's been using Revivogen shampoo and conditioner her hair is full, shiny and you can't see through to her scalp even in the sunlight like before. We are Revivogen users for life and will never switch.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!",1
"My hair typically does not hold a curl, but it looks amazing when I use this curling iron! My curls typically do fall a little, so I have to make them a little tighter than I actually want. My hair even still looks good the next day!",1
"My mother introduced me to this a year back. She has very oily skin and her dermatologist recommended she use this to control the excess oil. It controls breakouts and oily skin extremely well! After a few days you may notice your skin becoming extremely dry after washing with this, I would recommend using a moisturizer right after washing your face to combat the dryness. Other than that, excellent product. Good amount of product as well for the price. You won't find anything like this in stores.",1
This is just to much to much work and time consuming. I have not seen a difference. Too expensive for the time you need to put into it with very little to results.  I sometimes wondered if it made my thinning worse. It could differ from person to person.  Your hands get exhausted combing it through.,0
"Saw this on QVC double the price.
Does what it says
Great for Travel or handbag.",1
I prefer the Gillette adjustable I got on e Bay.,1
The diffuser didn't stay attached when I turned on my hairdryer.,0
"I was expecting something...better. For the price and the hype I thought it would leave my lips super moisturized, maybe looking healthier, more plump. Nothing! It was heavy and sticky.",0
"I purchased this as part of my introduction to D/E safety razor shaving, and if I was doing it all over again, I would have taken the money I spent on shave oils and used it for after shaves (the aftershaves and alum block do a great job of preventing razor burn and irritation, which was the entire reason for purchasing the shave oil in the first place).

It works ok, as it does seem to soften my beard--which is why I gave it 2 stars--but it leaves a film on my face that seems to interfere with the eshave shaving cream. It makes it hard to lather, and I feel like I have to wash my face after shaving to get this stuff off. Really an unpleasant feeling.

Plus, with using good lather and d/e shaving technique, this stuff is unnecessary and expensively superfluous.",0
"I 100% agree with the other posts. This box was NOTHING like the last luxury box. Samples were smaller all around, the selection was CRAP and then when I went to spend my $19.99 credit, I was surprised and PISSED over how restricted the selection of qualifying items was. I bought both women's beauty boxes last time around Christmas and LOVED them both so I was so disappointed when I discovered the quality of this box had diminished so drastically. I remember last time I was able to use the credits on a MASSIVE selection of qualifying items so even if I didn't love the samples, I knew I would still use the credit on some item I would have bought anyway making it fool proof worth it. Now I've got a $20 credit to use and can't find one single qualifying item that I like. THUMBS DOWN :(",0
EXCELLENT,1
"QUICK SUMMARY:  Pleasant smelling shampoo, but don't bother if you're a short-hair-wearing male.

BACKGROUND:  In my family, I think most of us -- which includes males and females, adults and children -- got a chance to try the Jack Black shampoo.  Opinions varied but centered around liking this product.

WHAT WE LIKED:

- I really liked the fragrance, which I found to be quite different than Suave Strawberry, my usual :-).  My daughters liked the fragrance but thought it to be quite powerful, and I thought differently (they said it's because I'm old, but of course, that's not it).
- A quarter-sized dollop lathered up just fine
- As for ""thickening""...I couldn't tell any difference, but I wear my hair very short.  My daughters say they didn't really notice any thickening, but they enjoyed using this product.  I think they just like the feeling of using something more exotic than our usual personal hygiene products.

There was nothing that we disliked about this product (although, given its expensive selling price, I would dislike paying nearly twenty bucks for shampoo that I otherwise get for a few dollars).

CONCLUSION:  There are many ways to pamper yourself.  This is one way to pamper yourself that costs about $20 but will last for several weeks (or months, depending on who's using it and how often).  Overall, not a bad a value exchange.",1
"I recently went to Hawaii and bought two of these bottles since the sun is pretty intense out there. I don't know if the 1st bottle I used was a default because my whole back burned. I thought that it was odd that my back only burned but I think it was mainly due because this was the area that was exposed because I was facing away from the sun the entire time in the pool.  I initially thought maybe I missed this area when I sprayed (although my husband sprayed my back) so the next day I used another sunblock and used this spray on my shoulder to see if it was the reason. Sure enough my shoulder got burned. This was very disappointing to say the least since these are pretty expensive and not a lot of product in the can. I ended up not using the second bottle since I was afraid I might have the same thing happen.  In addition, the formula smelled very strongly of alcohol. I will not be purchasing this again.",0
I'm just Love It.,1
"Didn't see much difference in my teeth. Would not buy again. Not worth it for the money. Found out the Crest Dental Rinse I was using was staining my teeth. Quit that, had my teeth cleaned by the dentist and threw the Crest and the Supersmile away.",0
"while the smell is not entirely unpleasant, it does not smell like the normal Clean Skin I have purchased repeatedly from Sephora, which smells better.",0
"This curling iron worked great for a solid month, then completely stopped heating up. I am extremely dissatisfied with my purchase.",0
I thought since this was Jane Iredale it would not be clumpy. Not only is it clumpy but very thick coming out of the container.  I use all of Jane Iredale's makeup was disappointed this wasn't up to expectations.,0
"I have medium/long wavy curly thick hair. I wanted this because I was tired of always wearing my hair in aponytail because it would talke an hour everyday to style. My hair was naturally Dark brown but I have been dying it bright red for the past 2 years so I have some damage but for the most part I take well enough care of it so that it was not totaly screwed up. This product has a lot of steps to it and I do NOT reccmoned it if you do nit have any experience with hair. I have been dying cutting and styinging my own hair for about 4 years now so I was ok doing this on my own. I reccommend using you tube for a few tutorials before applying, and throughly read the instructions before starting! I purchased the iFixx and I protect cream as well since my hair has undergine many chemical process' (Dying counts)
DO NOT use this after you have recently dyed your hair!!!!! It stripped alot of the red out of my hair after i used cream #1, also do not leave it on for a long time if you dye you hair frequently as IT WILL damage your hair. I left cream #1 on about 20 min after I completed the application (try to apply it very quckly starting with the area of your hair that is most course/curly, for me that was the back of my head). DO not put it on the ends of your hair until you are at that last 5 min of process time!!!!
 This product tells you to blow dry your hair and then straighten it before applying cream #2, now I hate using a blow dryer so I let it haor dry for a while before I used the blow dryer and I don't feel like it affect the quality of my results. I blow dried the rest when it was about 75% dry and then straightened it. You don't need the boi Ionic straightener for this but I do recommend using a good straightener. I have the CHI and it worked very well.
Cream #2 is the same but I let it process for about 7 min after I complete the application. After I washed it out I made sure I did not use any shampoo and I did not straigten it afterwards. I let it air dry so I could get an accurate idea of how well it worked, and I was pleasantly surpirsed. my hair was straight, it had some minor waves but it was mor managable. I put a litle more of the iprotect oil in as it was drying as it wasa little dry and frizzy but I blame that on the excessive amout of washing and chemicals applied to it. I also threw in some high quality Argan oil to add moisture back in, I will need to re-dye my hair in a few days since its kind of orange now but all in all its pretty good stuff. plus I did not need to use all of the product so I have enough to retouch it at least twice!",1
"I am very unhappy with this eyeliner... it doesn't last on me at all, as soon as I put it on it seems to start wearing off which is rare for me and it irritates my eyes.. the color was more like a dusty plum. Maybe this works for others, but it's not for me. I tried to return with no success. I would NOT recommend this product or dealing with this Seller!! :-(",0
I'm not sure if this has expired. But both my hand cream smell spoiled. The day I opened them. Very disappointed since I usually love this product.,0
"I adore these Stila lipsticks and have several shades. They really do stay on all day unless you have a hamburger for lunch. I apply then blot, and follow up with a thin coat of Smith's Rosebud Salve, and I'm done for the day! I find the colors are super pigmented; the dark colors are like Katherine Hepburn/Lauren Bacall dark. I layer the darker colors with this Patina, and it tones down to a lovely shade. I get lots of complements, even late in the afternoon after it's been on for 10+ hours and I've eaten at least one meal.

It can be a little dry or tacky, and it's not that easy to apply. I carefully apply a dark shade with the wand, blot then apply this Patina, blot again and apply Rosebud Salve so that it's not so dry. This is a little time-consuming, but I can forget about lipstick for the rest of the day.",1
"I LOVE this moisturizing sunscreen. It was recommended to me by a family member over 8 years ago when I was a Dog Walker. I couldn't find anything that would not make me break out, but still give me coverage throughout my hours of walking outdoors (and sweating/re-applying). This sunscreen saved the day and I have used it ever since. It's lightweight, but still keeps the skin moisturized. I have recommended this to many people in my life. I've found EltaMD products from many sources, but  Amazon has been great!",1
"The product itself is excellent.  It greatly helped a condition I've had for years when nothing else worked.  As stated by other reviewers, the packaging is poorly designed.  The bottle fell in the shower and I had broken glass stuck to the soles of my feet.  Fortunately, no cuts--just a time consuming mess to clean up and a lot of wasted product.  Let me say that the product works so well that I will be ordering another bottle.  This time I will transfer the contents to a plastic travel container to avoid another shower mishap.  The manufacturer needs to take customer safety into account and update its packaging.",1
"Horrible product, made all the pimples worse and really damaged my skin.",0
I actually bought this as a gift for my sister.  I gave it 5 stars because she loved mine and I know she would do that.,1
There is enough in this bottle for TWO sprays!! :(((,0
"2nd one I purchased.  It makes my hair feel smooth, not fried.",1
I have been using this for years and I really like it for my daughters hair. Don't love the new strawberry scent they added.,1
"Temporary reduction in hair growth.
Does not work.
Not worth the pain you have to suffer.
It takes for ever to cover a few square inches as it takes about 15 seconds to recharge between pulses.",0
"I absolutely love the smell of this, but I'm not crazy about the foam dispenser. It feels a bit wasteful.",1
It's very soothing and travels extremely well since it is a gel. Good with some mascaras but not all.,1
Absolutely love this product! I discovered it in the sample section at Target. I apply a small amount of this cream as a moisturizer in the morning and a thicker coat at night. It helped calmed my sensitive skin and kept it soft all winter.,1
"This stuff works great but it contains polyethylene, the plastic microbeads that have been banned as a significant environmental concern. The law allows them into 2017, but continuing to use this stuff is terrible for all bodies of water and sewage.

Here is the US bill

[...]",0
Still having a debate with myself whether I like this or the Redken Align better.,1
Lighter than I thought and coverage was not very thick. Still a good product if you don't want a lot of coverage. It is just the replacement and not in a compact.,1
Poor result didn't find any result will not buy it,0
"The 2x that my ends were really really badly scorched, and had to chop off at least 2.5 inches off my hair...was when I used this product on the regular. The first time, I thought maybe I just hot ironed too much...I quit using it. Started using Redken products instead until I ran out, a year later. I began went back to using this, and again my hair was badly burnt.",0
"I ordered the color amore. The lipstick I received was nowhere near the color depicted on Amazon. Whats more, the color in the tube was nowhere near the color on the box. The color I got was very dark and not natural looking at all. I wouldnt trust any of the color depictions, and so ordering this product is just a shot in the dark as to getting a color that works with your coloring.",0
Love it but probably won't use it again because if the price.,1
"Dry, did nothing. Threw it out. Complete waste.",0
Best ever!  This is my second one! Heats evenly and glides through hair easily.  I have owned several and none come close.  Would highly recommend!,1
"Well, I like the natural colour and the brand essie, but this nailpolish is the one that doesn't last even for a day and looks awful.",0
Not impressed.  Don't waste your money.,0
Left my hair feeling very weird. No noticable improvement in texture or thickness.,0
"Very disappointed. Product is watery, not consistency of other Pureology.",0
"I thought this was supposed to have sunscreen in it, but I cant find that anywhere on the ingredients list. Maybe I read it wrong... Doesnt hold that great.",0
"Way over priced, can find for half the price at other stores, that rhyme with with 'bowls' and starts with a k.
Scent is nice, but wears off fast",0
This is not an immediate fix by any standard.  I am a pale white male with pitch black hair and lots of it.  I bought this mainly for my face but decided to test it on my armpits as well.  My face has had no noticable changes over the course of three months.  The only thing I can see it do is create a layer of bleached hair so I think if I can keep this up it will eventually have an affect.  I think that part of the issue is that I get a lot of sun due to my work and hobbies so that may affect my result.  My armpits are another story.  Before if I didn't shave they could be long enough to stick out of my shirt.  Now it takes forever for them to grow back and when they do it is very thinned out.  A perfect result for 3 months.,1

"Very Nice, that I ordered it again for my wife's thinning hair..",1
the scent and the moisturizing in this is amazing!  LOVE it!,1
first found this soap in Croatia and after I ran out of the tiny ones I 'borrowed' from them I bought these here.  I wish they had the 100gram size but a fantastic hand soap with amazing natural lemon scent.,1
"My girlfriend has been using this foundation and she likes the consistency and the feeling of it on her face while wearing it. She said it blends in with her skin tone well and feels its moisturizing benefits.

It 's staying powder was adequate wearing through an eight hour work day just fine.

The one problem was that application took longer than with  fluid foundations. Because she isn't used to applying cream foundation. She was happy with the matte finish.

On the whole, aside from application, she has been satisfied with the product.",1
"I agonized over which hair dryer to buy, and I'm pretty happy I went with this one.  I picked it because it's a good brand for a good price with decent reviews.  It's very sturdy and it has the look of a more expensive, professional dryer.  The cord is very long, which is a huge plus.  The airflow is strong and doesn't get too hot.  It's not the quietest or fastest hairdryer ever, but it does the trick.  The only thing that drives me nuts is that I keep hitting the cool button all the time.  It's in an awkward place and depresses easily.  Overall, it's a strong play if you're looking for a simple, effective dryer.",1
"Comparing this to the one I bought from Ulta.com, this is fake. It was watered down when the consistency is suppose to be thick and milky. Beware.",0
Bulky width doesn't work well,0
So I bought the little bottle first to see how I liked it. I didn't use much each time I used it. Only was able to use it twice with that little bottle before it was empty. $22 for doing my hair twice? No thanks. It wasn't that good for that price. I honestly didn't see a difference between that and no product.,0
"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED ....  TOO STRONG ....  LIKE GLUE ....  MY MISTAKE HAVING ORDERED IT ...
NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS PRODUCT TWISTED FABRIC THAT I USE TO GET ..",0
Didn't care for it. Made my hair feel dry,0
"This is a very nice under-eye concealer cream.  It goes on easily, and covers well.  In fact it does a better job than anything else I have used and lasts all day.  Another majorr plus is the fact that it is unscented; fragrance is the last thing I want near my eyes.  It is pricey, though you need very little, so I expect it to last a while.  As far as I can tell, it just comes in one shade, which suitw my skin well, but a variety of shades would be nice, as women are not all one color (minus a star for that).",1
"Does not conceal even minor blemishes or veins.  Too thin, disappointed in this product.",0
I bought this with high hopes after reading all the 5 star reviews. It made me look weird like a yellowish tone. It did last all day I usually have to reapply I have oily skin but when I looked in the mirror It was such a strange color like I was sick.,0
"This is just a terrific product which doesn't feel like the typical ""product"" (i.e. hair gel) at all.  Using just a light touch with it and combing it into wet hair directly after showering, I found it provided a light but useful hold without even a hint of the shiny, plasticky feel of other gels.  This pomade provided a completely natural, plain-hair look and a soft, natural hair-feeling hold, far preferable to the sticky or over-rigid feel of more aggressive products.  Recommended.",1
"I have always been a fan of OPI and based off of the reviews I thought this product would be exactly what I needed to help my peeling nails. I used exactly according to directions and this product is nothing more than a crappy top coat. I have not noticed any difference in nail strength, in fact, the polish chipped very easily and my nails would break while the product was on. I am so disappointed in this product and the fact that I spent almost $18 for something that doesn't work.",0
Smelling really like fake product. It made my skin more horrible. Difficult to wash. like a glue on my face. Hate at all!!!!!! Disgusting...,0
"lovely color ! soft, pretty, slightly iridescent , more on the mauve side than pink. great coverage.",1
Just as advertised---strong hold.  Very pleased,1
"I love the product, but one of them won't spray out. Broken pump! Disappointing.",1
The hose would not stay connected,0
"Nice gentle toner, can be used on the eyes.  It doesn't do anything miraculous, just a great basic toner that does the job and doesn't irritate the skin.",1
"It is made with good high density wood that doesnt splinter or crack and sharpens easily. The glossy surface provides good grip. The core is soft, applies easily, and blends well. I have oily skin and the eyeliner spreads a little after around 4 hours, but not too much. It lasts all day. I personally like the deep, saturated black that it provides. Its easy to get a consistent application with pleasant look, especially with how easily it is to get a fine tip. It also cleans up very easily with makeup remover. Overall I like this product very much, particularly for its ease of application and the depth of its black.",1
This is not the same smell.  Something is off.,0
Pure excellence in every way,1
A great product that works extremely well.,1
"I was surprised how well it actually works!  No smell or residue.  It gives extra volume, feels a little like a hair spray, but it makes hair look clean (which is the ultimate goal).  I ordered the little ""sample size"", but I'll be re-ordering the bigger bottle next.",1
"I was so excited to get this base cost. I got it not even 4 days later, that was awesome! However, I've been using it for a month now and it makes my nails peel really bad :( so much for a base cost for natural nails. I'm so disappointed with it. I've never had this problem.",0
"My first encounter with Ahava's shaving cream was on a trip to Israel.  It was given to me as a gift.  I was thankful at the time, but my thankfulness grew after I got home and actually started using it.  I have a tough beard, but sensitive skin.  If I shave too frequently, I get razor bumps.  Ahava's shaving cream gives me a smooth, close shave, but without the irritation.  I have been using it ever since.  Highly recommended.",1
Came on time when promised.  Smells great and feels wonderful on the skin.,1
Seems like it would be great but didn't do much for me. I will keep trying though because I'm not great at the whole skin care thing,1
"Great set for shaving. The hot towel is a great prep for the skin. The shaving cream is great and makes your skin super slick. The shaved ice after the shave feels great. I love the cooling effect, reduces the pain and also closes up the pores. A great system and great when you travel when you need to shave on the go and quickly. I highly recommend it.",1
Look and feels like a trash bag I could rip it apart with my hands,0
"I love this product! With my roots lifted, my hair stays cleaner for longer. After applying a lot directly on my roots, I use a diffuser to blow dry my hair (using a heat protectant).",1
I like this shampoo but it can be hard to rinse out with repeated use.  It seems to leave a soap build-up in my hair when used for three or more consecutive days.,0
Smooth on the face. Sheer coverage so may need more makeup for a fancy event or if you have blemishes.,1
"I applied the mascara and primer as directed, on one eye. On the other I used my favorite, cheap, drugstore brand in the  ""pink and green"" container. You could not tell the difference!!! I am so upset that I spent so much money on this gimmick. Also, the next day, despite two face washings, I was constantly picking little black specks from my face left from the tiny fibers that are in the mascara.",0
"""Coming up Roses"" is the name of this color?!! It's a drab shade of pink. Not happy. Not impressed.",0
works as intended on my dry bleached long hair.,1
Doesn't work well,0
Love this color.,1
My husband's favorite shave line.,1
Good stuff.  Smells great...and is high quality.  My wife swears by it for our daughters.,1
didnt work well for my wife,0
"I bought this item Sept 12 2014 it's Nov 19 and the tip has broke off and I can't return the item. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!
Do not buy this is junk!",0
"Made my hair greasy and I only used two pumps!  I tried it three times, it just didn't work for me.",0
"Somewhere between a lipstick and a lip gloss, giving the best of both worlds.  Has the staying power of a stick, with the glide of gloss (but sans the stickiness!) Easy to apply; worth the price.",1
What l like is that It works without harming the enamel.,1
Good product.  Too bad you have to pay full price now as the manufacturer has shut off anyone selling it besides themselves so quite the little monopoly going on there,0
Leaves residue on me.,0
"We took this with us on our recent trip to Florida, and none of us had our usual sunburn issues. It comes out of the tube fairly dark, but it blends in well. It has a nice scent, and it didn't bother my wife, who has insanely sensitive skin.",1
These tubes are very tiny,0
This was not for me. I do not have great skin to start out with so I can't blame the product 100%. I am a person that needs more coverage and this did not do it for me. Also maybe I got the wrong shade. I got a light tan but it was too light. I love the fact that it is in a compact and is not messy but it just didn't give me the coverage and I felt it was pricey.,0
My nails are growing-finally! They usually break off once I get any length at all! This stuff really works for brittle nails.,1
This soap is great for hands and face but the talc really irritated my urogenital tract. Ouch. The smell is mild and makes a fancy hand soap. Not sure if I would give as a gift because of the talc though. Talc might be contaminated with asbestos so it's safer to use cornstarch.,1
"I paid a lot more for this hairdryer at Ulta.  I wish I had checked Amazon first.  The hairdryer is llight, quiet and helps control frizz.  It isn't quite as powerful as I expected it to be.  The buttons are in an inconvenient place on the handle, so it is easy to accidentally change the settings. I've been using this hairdryer for about 6 months and I am happy with it overall.",1
"The best curl setting cream made.  I use one complete squirt after each shampoo along with a squirt of the Paul Mitchell leave-in conditioner.  Put both together in the palm of your hand, rub together to mix and apply all over your hair, working in thoroughly.  My hair is pretty short and is permed so you may need a bit more or less for your hair length.  It will never leave your hair looking greasy or stiff, but rather soft and natural.",1
Such a nice new produch and smells fantastic.  That you for getting it to me right away  I just love it.,1
"For my mixed/oily skin is a no no.  I am sure it is great for people with dry skin, but for me it just caused the pores to clog up and break out.",0
I'm a big Oscar Blandi fan.  I like this because it adds shine to my hair and doesn't weigh it down at all!  I don't use much and I love the scent!,1
My beautician says she like the way my hair feels when she uses this shampoo. It is no longer dried out and hard to detangle. My daughter also uses it. We've noticed a difference using it.,1
I use this as a moisturizer on my face and enjoy it because it is tinted and I don't want to wear makeup. I have to use more than most women because my skin is dry but at the end of the day my skin still feels moist. Those little red bumps that pop up with other creams don't happen with this. The price is hefty but so is skin creams from Macy's.,1
"I don't really care much for this product. One of my friends uses it and said it was great to soften your curls after using gel. However, I didn't think it worked that well. It does help a little bit with frizz though. It also has a very unpleasant plastic smell. I don't think I will be buying this again in the future",0
pleasant scent and rich foam easy to achieve,1
does not make your hair too greasy.  smells great.  not too thick or thin.  makes your hair very shiny and bouncy.,1
"This will last you a long time. It's a gentle exfoliator recommended by an aesthetician at my local spa.  The fragrance is very nice. Just use a 1/4"" as it's very concentrated.",1
"CND Vinylux #132, is a nice neutral color",1
"I am using HairMax lasercomb from more than 3 months ago as instructed (for 15 min every other day). However, I do not see any results.  I gave the product two stars because I cannot tell if it keeps the rest of my hair and if I stop it I will lose all my hair or not.",0
Yep they did it again i bought this unaware that there was urea in the ingredient list. Once i did it went right in the bin.,0
No good,0
Ive been using this product for a few weeks now and I really like it.  It really helps with my rosacea and keeps my pinkness under control.,1
great perfume! Smells nice and is not overwhelming.,1
It works as long as you continue to use it.,1
"This product did not work for me. I have fair skin and dark hair,but no luck. There is zero difference after using for months!
I'm hoping I can return this.",0
"Nice,although the picture shows a bluish tint it's actually greenish.",1
"Best hand cream ever, and I have tried everything out there. I don't care for the scent but will gladly tolerate it for the results, and it goes away quickly.",1
GREAT PRODUCT SHIPPED VERY QUICKLY NO BAD NEWS,1
"Has a sweet semi-artificial, cheap smell despite the bergamot and tobacco expected. Two stars (not one) because it is much stronger than other cheaper candles I have - the scent carries around our apartment.",0
Makes no change.,0
Did nothing. Returned.,0
Has a bad oder to it and the product was seeping out and all over the bottle.,0
best of the best,1
Love it!,1
"didnt last a day in my hair, didn't covere the gray",0
This product smells good and did a good job moisterizing my hand. I use it in the morning and night. Very good product at this price,1
Not really doing anything.,0
I was not happy with this product. I didn't feel like it did anything. Would not recommend. Save your bucks!,0
You get what you pay for.,0
The box was not sealed; no protective seal... Very disappointed,0
Very disappointed. Worked great first day.  2nd day stopped working and will not heat up at all and will return,0
Love this stuff.  I was recently diagnosed with Telogen Effluvium which causes massive hair shedding.  This stuff is a miracle.  I am able to cover up the sparse areas and the wider than usual part flawlessly.  I will definitely be repurchasing.,1
love this stuff,1
too slow.  returned this item.,0
"I wanted this dryer for a very long time but held off on buying it because of the expense. When I saw the price at Sam's, I jumped on it immediately. I do like the dryer but I am also very glad I did not pay full retail price! The biggest thing I had to adjust to was the fact that it is much hotter, but not as powerful as the dryer it replaced.

Pros - very quiet; dries my long, thick hair quickly; the cool setting is a toggle switch so it does not need to be held down in order to change the temp

Cons - does not seem to dry my hair 40-50% faster than my old dryer; a bit on the heavy side; gets VERY hot so it's easy to burn your hand when doing a blow out or removing the attachments (it actually melted the bristles on a plastic paddle brush); the on/off switch and the hot/cold toggle are located in places where you apply pressure to actually hold the dryer to use it so i'm constantly either turning the dyer off or turning the cool setting on - annoying!

Even though I listed far fewer pros than cons, consider it more of an informative review than a warning. I can say that I am still glad I purchased the dryer.",1
"I've reordered this product twice.  Have used one other brand but believe this is the superior product.  It miraculously hides the scalp in thinning areas.  Sprinkle on, pat and you're good to go.  You don't know it's there.  It truly attaches.  Sleep in it, no mess on pillows in the morning.  Feel secure to wear hats or sweat during workouts.  It has given me confidence.  I no longer feel self-conscious about how thin my hair is getting as I age (I am 61).  I love this product!",1
Unbelievable. Very nice case contains micro amounts of product. Tiny circles of product that went to the bottom on first use. Extremely disappointed. Will return. Fair price would be $19.99. Just micro samples,0
Lemon-aid by Benefit works better,0
after year of use there is still hair growing,0
Mine didn't smell like the real thing. I think it was a fake or a bad batch. I gave it away.,0
Very good,1
great product! I use it everyday after my gym workout,1
Waste of money. Saw no changes what so ever!,0
"This was recommended by my dermatologist.  It works great for me, and is very gentle.  It reduces my dark circles and fine lines better than any other eye cream I have used, and I've tried a lot.  For the reviews talking about red eyes, I have to assume they got product IN their eyes.  It does state right on the package not to allow the product to get into the eye.  Which makes sense, if it's strong enough to help around the eye, you probably don't want it in your eye!  For the reviews talking about allergic reactions, anyone can suffer an allergic reaction to just about anything, but I am still surprised by the negative reviews.  I have extremely sensitive skin, so much so that I have only found one suntan lotion I can use on my face - only one!  But this product causes me no problems at all.  However, that one suntan lotion I can use did cause a severe allergic reaction for a friend, which completely shocked me as I found it so gentle, but proves the point.  Anyone can have an allergic reaction to an ingredient, it does not make the product a bad product, unless a large percentage of users have the same reaction.",1
Love this eye cream! I've been using it for 5 or 6 years and it's better than all the department store brands I've tried!,1
"This is my wife's favorite perfume, and has worn it for many years. The bottle I purchased for her birthday is noticeably weaker than normal. We are now beyond the return date and stuck with a $90 bottle of perfume. I wonder if this product has been sitting around too long or they are seconds? I will try to contact the amazon warranty department as this was sold by Amazon LLC",0
"I was not impressed. It didn't do anything, other than smelling amazing, for removing my makeup. I wear waterproof mascara and my coconut oil worked better at removing it. I would skip this one. I'm returning it to get some money back. It's like floral water - refreshing but does nothing.",0
Product does not work and the lotion has an awful smell. Aveeno baby unscented products work much better.,0
"I have extremely dry skin around my eyes and it gets especially bad in the winter. I tried several products, and either they don't moisturize enough or my skin would break out. This was the first product that actually did a good job moisturizing. The dry, peeling skin is gone. I've been using it for about a week and have not seen any breakouts.

The price was more than I want to spend, but a little goes a long ways! I'm sure this little jar will last me a few months.",1
This is a just - right cream  . Moisturizing but not too heavy. Fast to absorb with a mild pleasant scent. And if it is good for sensitive skin it should be good for all.,1
Holds my hair in place for a few hours only then need to re-apply. Smells very nice and feels good to the touch though,0
"The color is perfect for a nude, but unlike other LORAC shades, this one goes on very dry and stays that way. Disappointing.",0
not enough wattage,0
"The color is fine, but the actually product is super shiny and I have a matte face, so it stands out.",0
"i have fair, dry, acne-scarred skin. i use this over a light coverage foundation in the places i most need it so i don't cake up too much product. definitely set with a powder. use this sparingly, though! it's very pigmented but it should look natural as long as it's blended into your skin. since you only need a little bit, this jar will last a long time. i would definitely purchase again.",1
"It's ok. It does not rip your face off the way the girl in the video filmed it. We had several family members try it here too and not one had an issue. It was really easy to get off. We tried it thin, heavy-- all the same results without pain. I actually wanted the rip off factor. I don't know if they changed the formula or what or if that girl had a crazy hairy face...",0
It works as well as any of the other concealer.,1
"Good product and I am on my third tube. Makes my face feel polished, clean and most of all soft.",1
I have used other lash serums and of all of them I saw the least result with this one.  I used every night for 30 days and didn't feel as though the appearance of fullness or length of my lashes budged at all.  I used the bottom of a tube of Rodan & Fields lash serum for three days and could see results even with the last few drops I had.  It's more expensive but I get a discount and I've already ordered more.,0
"I'm back. I just received my order of 2...the large size. The best out there.

This product is awesome. Now if you have thick hair or long hair or think long hair use this and another conditioner together. You want to put this conditioner on first and then something like Herbal Essence Hello Hydration (use quite a bit) and leave on for 30-45 mins. Your hair will love it. I use this back and forth with Redkin or Macadamian mask (do not use a lot use same method as above)",1
"I was optimistic about this hairdryer but a few weeks in, a rattling noise started. Then after a few months, it totally stopped blowing warm air and I'm have to replace it. Would not recommend this product. It was a total waste of money.",0
"As a makeup artist, I know how important it is to have good brushes to do the best work.  Not only to you need the brush to perform well, but be durable and stand up to cleaning.  Let's see how the Japonesque Kumadori Countour/Highlight Brush measures up.

WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?
This brush is about 6 1/2"" long with the handle being 5"" and the brush head 1 1/2"" long.  The brush head is about 1 3/8"" wide at its widest point.  The shape of the brush is a teardrop shape.  The bristles are natural and they are not at all dense in the way they are packed.  I would put this more in the fluffy category and not dense.

The handle is tapered, but the base seems to be a rubbery base underneath.  A rim of that material is visible up near the base of the brush head.  The rest of the handle is wrapped with a natural piece of what resembles thin wicker.  I am not sure what the actual name of it is.  It is wrapped and glued down with the end tucked up under at the top.  It simply ends at the tip of the handle and is not tucked down.  The surface texture of the wrapped handle makes it easy to hold and manipulate in your hand, although in certain positions it can feel rough.

HOW DOES THIS BRUSH PERFORM?
As for performance, this brush does not do too well picking up product from a pan unless the pan of makeup is very very soft and easily picked up.  It does not disperse the product as equally on the skin as I would like.  I have tried this with blush, bronzer and highlighter, but I find that it seems to work best with Guerlain Meteorites.

That is not necessarily a bad thing as Guerlain Meteorites are little balls of product which are in different colors.  It is hard to find a brush which applies them well.  They act more as a highlight or finishing powder in a very subtle manner.

This brush would also work decently with mineral makeup.  The tip makes it get into smaller spaces of the face like around the nose and inner eyes, but is broad enough to use on the rest of the face and under the chin.

I did not find that the bristles were dense or sturdy enough to pick up sufficient product to apply to the skin evenly from pans of color such as contour or highlight.

I tend to get better results from brushes in that same shape but much higher density than this one is.

WHAT I DO NOT LIKE ABOUT THIS BRUSH
My biggest problem with this brush is that it is not going to be easy to clean.  Brushes are meant to be used and that means they will get dirty.  Sometimes handles will also get dirty.  In the case of this brush, the handle being wrapped by the wicker like pieces, I don't see this brush being easy to clean.  The bristles being wet only is possible, but any moisture at all on this handle is bound to make it come apart eventually.

I imagine if you were to coat the handle with something that would withstand moisture, you could probably still use this brush and it would be more practical.  That way the handle would not unwrap with constant cleaning and you could still enjoy the brush.

THE BOTTOM LINE
If used for application of light powdery highlights or contour that is not packed hard in a pan, or sphere powders like Guerlain Meteorites, this brush would be good.  For use where you want to deposit color more evenly from pans of product, it is not the best brush. The composition of the handle makes it not practical to clean as if the handle becomes wet over time, the handle will probably come apart.  It you are a brush collector and love unusual brushes, and the practicality of this does not matter to you, then you might still love this brush.  If you are a practical person who uses their brushes a lot and likes to keep them clean all of the time, this might not be the brush for you.

I have rated this two stars because I feel that it just isn't practical for makeup use that leads to lots of cleaning for that price.",0
"This product is OK.  It's not all that the company claims it to be, but I do use it frequently.  As a curling brush, it is good, but as a flat iron, not so great.  I would NOT use this on long hair.  I tried it on my grand daughter's long hair, and it immediately became entangled up in her hair.  My hair is about medium length, and occasionally gets entangled in the brush, but mostly it is just OK.",0
"After reading reviews on several different hair dryers this one stood out.  Most people commented on how quiet it was, and they were absolutely correct.  This not only is a powerful hair dryer using ion technology, it is very quiet.  There are variable speeds for both hot and cold.  In fact you can blow cold air by just pressing the blue button, which comes in handy for us when our young daughter complains if it gets too hot.  It makes my daughters hair smooth and shiny, whereas the other blow dryer makes it frizzy.

My only complaint is the ac power adapter is not durable.  I have had to fix the reset button a couple times or it will not turn on.  For that you just need a screwdriver, but it's worth it since this is so quiet and effective.  When the adapter first broke we went back to our other basic hair dryer and it was so loud and less efficient my wife made me fix this one right away.",1
This is Great......!!!!,1
not recommended,0
Too thick and does not cover a dark spot with minimal application. Would have to apply much more which would appear cakey and thick.,0
It's my third tube - obviously I like it,1
"I have medium thickness hair and used it to make a low upward twist. It did not stay up on its own, I had to use many bobby pins to make sure it stayed in place and it still did not feel secure. Using it for a half-up do, the same thing happened - it did not stay up on its own, even when I grabbed not too much hair. My hair had hairspray and was not washed so it was not slippery but this didn't seem to help. Good idea for a product, but poor execution.",0
"Was hoping the product would provide shine and seal hair. Instead got the opposite. Harsh product
Would not recommend.",0
Great to use intermittently to get rid of built-up oils.,1
"My nails normally chip the same day I polish them, if not the following day. I'm on day 3 so far and no chips! I was very skeptical about the product but I was so fed up with painting my nails and then removing it the same day,  but so far so good! Would 100% recommend. I did apply two coats and sort of rubbed it on, making sure I fully covered the tips and slightly under the nails (my nails have a little length), I then used a base coat, and polish, no top coat. The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I think it's a little expensive (I paid $14 at Sally's) plus I think you need more than one coat, although I can't be sure as I never tried with only one!",1
Great shaver. I have about 7 Merkurs now and love everyone of them. Merkur means great quality.,1
"Smells great, like peppermint.",1
"I am NOT reviewing the seller.  I bought my olaplex No 3. directly from a salon.  I was not impressed with the results, even combined with the initial salon treatment.  It didn't add any shine, smoothness, or pizazz.  I have virgin hair.  Maybe it works better with dyed or permed hair.  ? For the price, though, forget it.  If you tolerate silicones go for Oribe or drybar.  If you hate silicones, then go to CR or even John masters.  Their results far surpassed this total waste of money.",0
"This is the only curling Iron I've ever used.. the very first one I bought was 8 years ago and lasted me about 4 years.. before the inside hinge broke off.. I bought another and I suppose they had by then been updated with the 360* rotating cord so no it doesn't twist and tangle.. ever since they have easily broken within months..twice the little black thumb grip broke off.. then the rotating cord stopped working (like it somehow disconnects the actual cord from the rest of the wand so there's no power.. this was the last one I bought (bringing me to a total of 4 AFTER my first one) and from day #2 of using it the rotating cord once again was causing the power to go out.. it turns on for the most part.. but as soon as the bottom turns with the movement the light goes out.. and if I'm not watching it consistently to make sure the light is still on.. I end up losing the heat and having to wait.. I have more hair than Mofasa, curlier than a cabbage patch kid and with the very first one I got (without the rotating cord) it would take me about 10 minutes to do my hair, it was amazing.. ever since they changed the model, besides breaking as easily as I just stated, they don't heat the same either.. it takes me longer to get to the highest setting and it takes about 3-5 slides through my hair to set the curl properly instead of just 1 (with the old model).. I don't know if they changed the actual metal piece, but they must have for a cheaper version because like I said, it used to heat in about 40 seconds and flatten my hair with one slide.. not I'm lucky if I'm done with my hair in under 30 minutes..",0
Product works great without over drying your skin,1
Works great even with naturally curly hair.,1
"For the price, I was disappointed. Smells nice, but didn't slow the flow.",0
Leaves your hair too sticky ,0
"I have such sensitive skin and also Rosacea.  Almost everything irritates my skin, which is very frustrating. I
absolutely love this skincare lotion because it actually calms irritated skin.  I apply in the evening
and it just feels like silk on your skin. When you wake up your skin is calm and dewy--love it!  La Roche-Posey
is probably one of the best skincare lines out there--next to Jan Marini.",1
it did not put on a heavy enough coat.,0
"I tried it, but just not good for my super curly hair.",0
I looooove this product..my winter treatment for dry skin.,1
"I personally found this formulation to be irritating to my skin. I suspect that it may have more to do with the acetone and menthol than the glycolic acid, as I have since tried another glycolic acid product of similar concentration that does not cause the uncomfortable itching/burning sensation that this product did. Despite that I had to stop using it, I did find that the disposable pads were convenient for daily use.",0
Dry and cracked heals are gone!  Makes me very happy!  I have recommended it to several people who have also bought it!,1
Makes my hair have static. Don't really like it.,0
This is a very good product. It works perfect on my skin. The service was excellent.,1
"Very bad experience, very bad product packaging is completely lost, not recommended, I made a purchase of several products, the seller lost everything I pack in one box. abusers! stole a perfume",0
"with this cream, my chapped hands feel good",1
This product info on the Mason Pearson website indicated that this was a 100% Boar Bristle brush but when it arrived from amazon it was 100% nylon bristles. I am returning this product asap.,0
Really makes my eyes burn. I must be allergic to something in this. Maybe stronger chemicals than I'm used to... I try to go as natural as possible. Within minutes my eyes really start to water and burn. This product is not for me.,0
When I opened the package my nails polish was broke!!! I am not happy,0
"Has more of a perfume than I would like, but I love the color. It stays fairly well for a glossy balm. This one is more orange than I expected but turns out I like it!",1
"Still trying to get the hang of using a large barrel curler but the product itself feels very high quality, heats up quickly, and produces great curls.",1
Love the texture of this lotion.,1
"They call it special for a reason.
this is not for daily uses.  This product is to heal
your scalp from harsh shampoo and conditioners  by people who wash
their hair everyday like me.  You should use it maybe twice a week
till you notice your scalp feels better. then maybe once or twice a month.
this is why u think its is such a small bottle.  it is bigger then small, you get my drift...
it has a mint smell to it.  keep out of your eyes..  feel better!",1
"Great eye cream. Pricey, but worth it.",1
"Best sunscreen, doesnt irritate skin nor leaves it oily!",1
DID NOT fit my Elchim hair dryer so I had to put an elastic bra strap on it and tie it to my hair dryer...the things we do for beauty,0
Best moisturizer.,1
"Great value, very gentle on my skin. Mild smell and feeling. I'm not sure it does that much for my skin but it seems to clean excess residue after cleansing. I use as an extra step to make sure all of the makeup has been removed completely.",1
"This is good. Does what it's supposed to do. I wish it was slightly darker, without being as red/peachy as the next color made by this brand. That being said, I still use it everyday. New addition to my morning routine. Unless you want to shine like crazy or are as white as snow, then buy a different color.",1
"My husband loves this. He has it in all bathrooms, his gym bag, and his travel bag. Can I say more? If one runs out, he has me buy at least two. Our hair salon usually has it in stock. If they are out I order by mail !",1
"I loved this curling iron. Used it once and it worked perfect. Went to use it the next day and it wouldn't heat up. Now I have to wait a month for them to replace it. Not happy, because I have multiple events this month I wanted to use it for.",0
"Love, love this product!! I use it every time I shampoo my hair and it gives it shine and body.  It also keeps my hair soft and healthy so I don't have to shampoo everyday.",1
This is not REAL StriVectin - it doesn't have the silver seal - this is a complete mis-representation and I will be writing a review!,0
I first found  this color Rosy future when I went to get my nails done at a salon. I was instantly obsessed with the light pink iridescent Shimmer that almost has a purple Hue to it. I plan on wearing this color on my nails on my wedding day.,1
"This is a decent concealer, better than some but not so different from some other brands (Clinique).  I would purchase it again.",1
"Works ok, not their best product, would not order again, though I do use Wen cleaner and other Wen items.",1
I have sensitive skin and easily get closed pores and itchy skin due to products. This moisturizer is light enough for daily wear but moisturizes enough to use at night as well.,1
One of the rollers broke within weeks of using and it no longer heats up. The others have continued to work but are almost too large to stay in place on my head.,0
"I have received so many compliments on the smell of this fragrance from women and men,everyone wants to know what's the name of it and where they can get it, if they sold It by the truck load l would buy again and again and again this is like sex in Bottle. by the way do they sell it in gallon bottles ?",1
"Dont buy, its fake",0
Horrible soap. Doesn't lather. Only plus Is it smells nice... just wish it would flippin' lather!,0
"I was expecting a better moisturizer because of the buzz about Obagi. It's simply OK, I've used other brands that have much better moisturizing power and had SPH protection, which this one doesn't have. I don't think I'll be buying again.",0
"Nice product, but not sure it is worth the price. Does a good job, but I don't see much a difference from the $60 one I got from Sally Beauty. A little heavy too.",1
"This will not fit a standard size shaving brush. Luckily, I used some ingenuity and mounted it to my wall upside down. Now it fits my shaving brush and provides a sufficient amount of surface area to place my straight razor on top of. Don't expect to sit this on your counter and believe it will hold a full size shaving brush though.",0
Covers well,1
"This is  a product I've had difficulty finding in this mini size.  I'm so thankful I was able to purchase from your company, as this size and brand is one I could not do my fine, thin hair without.  By far, it's the best!!!",1
"I bought this at my local Ulta along with several other MB products. This stuff does not work at all. At least for me anyway. I have some cystic acne bumps that are reoccurring and nothing seems to work so I thought I'd try this stuff out. I shake the bottle real well, and then dab it on my bumps with my finger. It feels like all it does is literally sit on top of my skin. Then it dries but you can't tell anything happened. Wake up the next day, still nothing. I have used this product for a month now and have seen absolutely no results. Do not waste your money. The drying cream and mask work way better as spot treatments. I haven't tried the drying lotion yet, but plan on using it next.",0
great product. My husband and son absolutely love the Art of Shave products. They last long. Smells good,1
"This hairspray is one of the best I've ever tried, and believe me I've tried a lot.  It gives my  fine hair lasting volume, and a little goes a long way.  My hair is not stiff, feels fuller to the touch, and still looks good at the end of my work day.  Very happy with this product.",1
"No miracle... Overpriced, no significant results..
I still have half left... I cant say it does a thing except moisteurize.",0
"I have long, thick, medium curly hair.  I honestly didn't notice any difference when I used this stuff.  I tried adding it to my hair before using my blow dryer and straightener and tried using it after my hair was already straight.  I didn't notice any real change in the texture / frizziness of my hair.  It smells okay, but I wouldn't buy it again.  I've had better results with the Frizz-Ease brand hair serum.",0
"This is my favorite leave in conditioner. The smell is incredibly pleasant, it makes my hair feel silky and I just love it. I recommend it to everyone",1
"This is an amazing collection of eyeshadows. It's a perfect mix of matte and shimmery nude colors. They are very neutral shades that would work for any skin tone. The powder isn't a creamy buttery texture, but not like rubbing chalk on your eyelids. It does blend well though. It does stay well with a primer. Without one, it has worn off by quitting time in places. The pigment is good. Not great for some of the colors. The dark ones are packed! The medium shades are the least. Which is sad because I love the matte feisty.  I ran out of it super quick. Flawless is a nice matte shade that's really nice chocolate brown. The highlighter s are decent.  All in all its a great everyday palate,  that works well on anyone!!!",1
Not sure why I purchased this.  I have other cleansers which do a better job.,0
I just love this and will get more,1
"DO NOT BUY THIS NAILPOLISH! It is definitely NOT worth the money! It flakes and chips off really easily. The hearts don't stick on very well and come off extremely easily. The glitter doesn't like to come off the brush. It looks really pretty in the bottle, but in my opinion, it doesn't come out well on nails.",0
"I am very demanding when it comes to dryers.  I work in the beauty industry and tested many driers before I decided on this one.  I purchased this for travel, and it has been great.  Light weight and smaller than the usual full size appliance.  It works fast and gives a polished look.  For home use I prefer the Babyliss Carrera. 2 1/2 years have passed and I am still loving this drier. I travel about once per month for several days so it gets good use.",1
"I have mixed feelings about this curling iron, because it has some really great features and hasn't royally screwed anything up yet... it just doesn't work very well for my hair.

Here are some awesome things:
-the swivel cord... keeps it out of the way when it needs to be
-the temperature adjust... allows you to choose exactly how hot you want the iron
-it heats up VERY quickly
-it has a little stand so you can prop it up when you need to put it down on the counter

But for some reason, my curls just won't stay. I'm still giving this 4 stars, however, because I don't doubt that this is because of the length and thickness of my hair, and not necessarily the curling iron itself. I have not tried it on its hottest setting yet (because I'm scared of the burn horror stories I see in reviews) but may just have to try it if nothing else works.

So overall, it's a very cool looking curling iron with a lot of really fantastic features, but it hasn't quite lived up to my expectations yet.",1
Great value!,1
I use this product with my electric face brush (Clarisonic and similar brands) and find that it does a great job of soothing my skin while I'm buffing off the top layer of skin. I wouldn't use this as a makeup remover or for cleansing in absence of exfoliation of some sort.,1
love that stuff and my hair salon was out because they are redoing the formula or something. Got the last one,1
"This is a wonderful lotion, especially for dry winter weather. The lavender scent is relaxing. This is one of my favorites!",1
Smells great but after using it for 6 months I didn't notice a difference.,0
"I love the highly perfumed scent of this lotion- it's got a very, very strong lemon note with less prominent notes of lavender, cinnamon, and chocolate.
It's a white color, and a perfect consistency for me- it comes out of the tube easily but it isn't at all thin or watery.  It's thick enough so there's no waste squeezing it out, and it isn't so thick it doesn't spread easily.  It absorbs in quickly, and leaves skin highly scented, smooth, and soft, and it does ease crepe on my hands, knees, neck and arms.

My main issue with this product is that it does contain dimethicone, which, to me is a cheap ingredient that feels great but isn't all that great for skin when used regularly.  Some people find that dimethicone causes their skin to get drier over time with regular use, like a rebound type dryness.  I switch my lotions out a lot depending on what scent I feel like, and I rarely use them daily, so it's really not a problem for me.  This could be an issue for some, but not others.

Bottom line, it's highly perfumed- you probably won't like it if you don't like the scent of lemons.  It works as advertised but I wouldn't use it frequently, and monitor that your individual skin doesn't suffer from a rebound type dryness with it's use.",1
LOOOOVE this for contouring. You can put a little or keep adding for a more glam look. I also love using the highlight to go over my under eye concealer. And the compact size is perfect for taking with you during your travels.,1
Hot tools are awesome. Cheapest I have found anywhere.,1
I will definitely not use this product again.  I have very sensitive skin and this over-priced product caused red bumps to appear on my face within seconds of applying it.  It took several days for my skin to completely heal.  I'll stick to Neutrogena's oil free moisturizer for sensitive skin.  This has been my go-to moisturizer for years.  It's never irritated my skin or caused acne.,0
"As a woman with thinning hair it's vital that I find a good product to make it look thicker. I don't know how other buyers on here can rate it so highly when it makes your hair look and feel like you haven't washed it in a week. With such a greasy look too, it makes your hair look thinner than ever. One of the worst hair products I've ever bought (second only to one that made my hair break off).",0
Does not warm at high temperature,1
"This stuff is amazing. It lasts forever because I use a tiny amount, and it takes care of the puffy dark circles under my eyes that I inherited from my dad, and late nights, or seasonal allergies only increase. I've been looking for a quality product that does just that without costing me a fortune, and this one does. I've been using it for years, and got my last one here off amazon when my favorite local store to get it closed.",1
"I don't understand the great reviews, so I feel obligated to share my negative impression of this facial spray. To be clear, there's nothing wrong with it. It has a pleasant smell, but I don't understand the purpose. I don't see how it's refreshing or moisturizing in any way. I suppose spraying something on your face can wake you up if you're feeling drowsy, but I'm fairly sure water could do that too. If you enjoy spraying something on your face during the day, you'll like this. Reading the description, I expected it would, but that was  not my experience.",0
Love this product.,1
"For the $, there's far better makeup on the market. This stuff is cheap and messy.",0
"I hated it! Nothing stuck to my hair, only to my scalp. Now it looks like theres dry dirt on my scalp. Very noticeable and looks ridiculous. I don't know how other people say they like it....",0
"Horrible, hazard, stay away, smells weird, fake!",0
Works well.,1
It peels off.,0
Good product,1
Good quality.,1
Very good smell. My husband loved it. I got the original product too.,1
nice price for it,1
"I found that after day 1 I had to reapply, as the color never went on again as darkly as it did on day 1.  I have reverted back to using my Mary Kay with the gel pot, which is annoying to use, but works far better.",0
"I don't see how this kit is going to reduce the ""crepe"" effect as the name strongly suggests. It's a good exfoliator though.

Signs of aging aren't going to be smoothed away but the skin can be made healthier through exfoliation and for some the moisturizing is an excellent second step. As far as I can see, the innovation this product represents is that it's a 2-step process.

The products have a light citrus scent. They don't have SPF protection. They're not exclusively directed to people with ""crepey"" skin, since of course exfoliation and moisturizing are good for non-crepey skin.

My wife likes the product and reports that it's good although the cost seems high even after use.",1
"Beautiful palette. Itcwas bigger than I thought. The colors when one very nicely,  not super pigmented but not powdery like other brands I have tried. This has all u need . Love it.",1
the packaging may look legit but it is still not the real ahava dry oil product.. do not order this.,0
I Loved it!!  My hair was so damaged and felt like straw before my olaplex treatment. I followed with a coconut oil/almond oil mask and immediately noticed my hair absorbing the oil whereas before it would just sit on top and not penetrate the hair shaft. I Will definitely be purchasing again!!! Very happy customer!!!,1
The bottles are microcosmic in size. I needed a micro-magnifying glass just to see the items that were sent to me. This product is way overpriced for what is received.,0
"As someone with older dry skin this worked well for me. However it is somewhat yellowed than my skin color. I mixed in Juice Beauty tinted moisturizer in tan to match my color better.
A little bit does go a long was as Jane I red ale is thick but that's what I like about it. It really makes my skin look the best. Winter dries you skin out like crazy but this makes my skin feel great.  Would give it 5 stars if they gave you more product. I would recommend this especially for mature skin. I'm 53 yes old.",1
GOOD,1
These are not the best quality body washes.  They have a nice scent but are watery.,0
So far so good but have to see what happens with the upcoming sessions,1
These are amazing! Wish I would have know about these years ago. Works great!,1
"Box was torn open. Haven't tried it yet but it seemed used...

Update: the tan is somewhat ""orangy"" which is not an excellent color. Wouldn't buy it again.",0
Have had this product for a few months and doesn't hold well plus leaves a white residue. Definitely won't buy this again,0
Great root lifter for fine hair.,1
"I obviously liked it as I purchased a second one. The first came with the shower head, this was the replacement. The filter was easy to change out, and you can instantly feel the difference it makes on your water. LA water is harsh and full of chlorine, making it extremely drying on your skin, hair and havoc on your haircolor. As someone with purple hair that typically fades quickly, this helped extend my color, which trust me, is a miracle in itself. It's also made shower cleaning easier as there are alot less mineral spots.",1
Smells nice nut that's all. Could be pretty for photos but it comes off so fast.,0
My naturally curly hair LOVES this product!! Good hold through entire day of work or play. Love the no nonsense and hair benefiting ingredients. LOMA rocks!!,1
Awesome leave in cream for thick hair!  And it smells heavenly!  I have very thick medium length hair and this is the best product for getting a comb through it when it is wet!,1
Turned me yellow. Sent it back.,0
"I must have received an old bottle. It was really dry when I put it on. There was even a crack in the lip color,  like how your nail polish gets cracks when it's old. So disappointed as I was looking forward to trying this out.",0
"I have ruddy, red skin from years of plucking and waxing hair off of my neck. I used a silicone applicator to put this on. It is green at first but quickly blends in and helps tone down the redness quite a bit. It also feels very light, so it is great for those of us who do not like to wear foundation or makeup at all. I worked out at the gym wearing it and it did not smear or run.",1
"Beware, this is only a refill. The picture shows a product container, very misleading (and bad value!).  Also,  color Is obviously different (lighter) from my last purchase.",0
my go to makeup for foundation as has excellent coverage. Make sure you write down the color that works for you though as I had to reorder as I ordered the wrong color when replacing because I guessed because the label on the bottom with the correct color faded. Still worked out okay - I just use a different one in the summer and a lighter one in the winter. Prefer the rosier one though.,1
"Really works, when applied correctly. Great product for those with a lil insecurity, purchased the smallest as a test and I foresee future purchases.",1
Love the product,1
This is a good product however I've had so many problems with the sprayers not working I've had to throw away full cans because the sprayer quits! I have emailed the company about this problem and apparently they don't care.,0
It's very difficult to apply -  it's like putting elmers glue stick in your hair. Very hard to distribute!,0
One of the replacement heads arrived broken. I'll go back to buying the generic brand for a third of the price.,0
"I've tried other hair products like Uppercut and Layrite, they just didn't hold up to what Reuzel does.  I have super thick wild unmanageable hair, and this did more than tame the beast.  It's got a great shine without the funky smell some pomaded carry.  You won't regret the purchase.",1
shade is not what i expected at all,0
A friend suggested I try this hair spray and I'm glad she did.  It holds without being stiff or sticky.  Worth the extra money.,1
"Very small, tiny size and didn't make a noticeable change in my skin's appearance. Not worth the price.",0
Really good variety of good quality brushes for a great price. So much better than those low quality bundles you see sold everywhere. The bristles are soft but firm and they don't shed all over the place. Great buy if your too lazy to clean your old brushes like me!,1
"I have eyelashes that are very difficult to curl and normally lose their curl very quickly. However, I have used a Shu Uemura eyelash curler with much success in the past. I decided to give the Japonesque curler a try since it had so many positive reviews and since the refill pads are free.

I was immediately a bit skeptical when I opened the package and the curler felt very cheap and ""loose."" I gave it a try anyway...and found it was no better than the $5 curlers from a drug store, maybe even less effective. I would have to apply a lot of pressure to the curler to get it to create any curl at all, and even then had to go over my lashes 5-6 times. Any curl that I got fell out within 2 minutes.

I have ordered another Shu and this one will be going in the trash as soon as I receive it.",0
Wrong product again.,0
"It's expensive, but you feel like you just had a cleaning. Your teeth feel all slickery and smoothe. No aftertaste, fresh, lovely.",1
"I've used this product for a very short time, but I love it.  I am using the sensitive formula, and it did say that it could tingle at first.  Well, the first time I put this on in burned!  I was really worried that it was going to burn my skin completely off, but I kept on for the 10 minutes.  I figured that I wasn't going anywhere for several days, so why not see.  The burning stopped in about a minute and it felt very refreshing on.  There was no tightness with some other masks that I've uses.  Plus, it's colorless on, so it doesn't frighten my kid!  LOL  When I rinsed it off for the first time I was amazed at just how wonderful and soft my skin felt!  To be daring, I used it the following night for another 10 minutes.  That time there was no burning sensation.  I guess the first time around it was just doing what it was supposed to and exfoliate the dead skin.  I have already noticed after one week of using that my skin is softer, and the coloring is more even.  I also don't have any dry patches, nor to I have any excess oil in the T zone.  This stuff is truly  a wonderful addition to my skin care regimen!",1
Curls don't last- my curls last better with my Conair clipless curler that was half the price,0
Doesn't take off all of my makeup. Wipes were better.,0
"I have previously purchased this hairspray from a beauty supply store.  In many, many years, never had a problem with the sprayer.  This is the first time that I have purchased through Amazon.  I have cleaned the nozzle and done all that I can but I will have to throw away 1/2 can of product.  Will not spray properly.  If these are 2nds from the manufacturer, they should be advertised as such and priced accordingly.  Not very happy.",0
"I've tried moisturizing gloves before with mixed results. They are usually hard to get on and off. In this case, I was pleasantly surprised. They are easy to get on and take off. They seem to work well and have a nice mild scent. I recommend them.",1
Good,1
"It does seem to work! I'm no longer looking at my scalp through my thinning hair--I'm looking at my cut. Hair seems fuller. The only thing I don't love about it is the medicinal-minty smell. Not my favorite. But a very small thing--it's the results, not the experience I'm after.",1
"I have used many different crystal nail files, and this is by far the worst. It snapped on the first use, though I wasn't putting any pressure on it at all. I still use one of the shards, and the surface grit has not dulled. I  much prefer the NailTek XL or the Essie crystal file. In any case,  no matter what file you buy, make sure it is a true crystal file as opposed to a glass file with grit adhered to it.",0
My skin is itchy and broke out after using it,0
Didn't perform half as well as my $20 flatiron and it's steamed,0
Let me tell you I never tried butter london's make up and I'm not sure why. I have so many eye pencils that I'm always grabbing this one. It's smooth and long lasting.,1
thought it would be more ivory gold...,0
"Made my eyes after use ,puffy.",0
Nothing like the original Euphoria. Scent is gone almost as soon as you spray it on.,0
"I bought this nail polish for my mom for Christmas.
She was looking for a nice red that would not chip. This product pretty much covers that. It is very strong and stays on well. I would still recommend using a clear top coat though.
Only problem is that it can be a little hard to get off and use some extra rubbing and nail polish remover.

Bottom line: I would recommend this product!",1
Your hair will not stayed curled. I have tried using this curler so many times but it just doesn't make nice bouncy curls that stay. Rather the curls fall out almost instantly. You get what you pay for and the was definitely not worth it.,0
"I was really loyal to the brand OPI for my nail polish needs. When I ordered this, I had really low expectations because it wasn't my usual brand. Two weeks ago I painted my nails with it. My manicure still looks fresh and unchipped.

I'm not easy on my nails. I wash dishes by hand. I play in the dirt. I wash them a hundred times a day. And fourteen days later it's still perfect. Better than OPI. This product is amazing.",1
"LaRoche-Posay is a brand I love for skincare, and was excited to find out they have cosmetics!

I have very sensitive eyes, with mascara being the worst offender. Through trial and error, I can usually find a non-waterproof mascara to use, but finding a waterproof one that I can tolerate is like finding the Holy Grail. And EVERY time I do find one, it is discontinued! I'm currently using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Palladio-Aqua-Force-Waterproof-Defining-Mascara-Black/dp/B00CQNM6XS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Palladio Aqua Force Waterproof Defining Mascara, Black</a>&nbsp;but I hate it. It does nothing for my lashes, but it's better than nothing if it's raining out or I know I might cry.

I first tried this LaRoche-Posay before I took a shower. I didn't bother to curl my lashes. HOLY COW! It went on like a dream, and the more I applied, the bigger and more dramatic my lashes got. It even curled them (although not as dramatically as an eyelash curler). And they were smooth and silky looking, not clumpy or with bits hanging here and there. I then took a shower, making sure the water got right in my face. I was so shocked to see that my lashes looked exactly the same afterwards! Other waterproof mascaras I've tried didn't run when wet, but my lashes would uncurl, look mangled and ""chunky.""  This mascara left them perfect.

I did have a hard time removing it, however. I can only use non-oily removers due to my acne-prone skin, so I'm sure that's why. But I had to bring out the big guns and do a lot of scrubbing.

I tried the mascara for real the next day.  I experienced a slight irritation (burning) in my eyeballs after a number of hours. Sometimes when that happens, if I use a product a few more times, the burning stops. It doesn't really make sense to me, but that's what occurs, and did in this case. I now have an amazing waterproof mascara!  I would use it exclusively if it was easier to get off with my normal removers.",1
The tube is extremely hard to get anything out of. I have used this product for a week and my skin is very flaky and dry after using. I will be sticking with my usual product and throwing this in the trash.,0
I'm a big fan of the Baux cologne by Loccitane so I bought this blindly.  It smells great and similar to Burberry Weekend with light citrus sent.  Unfortunately the smell only lasts about an hour or so and that's while using the matching deodorant and aftershave. Very disappointing.,0
I had heard someone on t.v. talk about what a wonderful scent this had and how good their baby smells.  I thought I would give it a try.  I use mostly natural face creams but I absolutely love this.  It gives my skin a nice silky glow and holds in the moisture.  It has such a nice light scent as well.  Im not sure why they only market this to babies because everyone I have told about it loves it as well.,1
Works well with the Babyliss hair dryer I purchased.  Does what it is supposed to do.,1
This product works great on dark spots.  I had a bump on my nose and kept messing with it and caused a big dark brown spot on the tip of my nose.  What a bummer.  I used this product and it faded away within about 7 or 8 days.  This product is great.  I doesn't have to be used only on dark spots you can use it on your entire face to even out your skin tone.  I use it before I put on my moisturizer..,1
"It smells wonderful and the product is great. But..The bottle unfortunately had a leak. Although it was taped down well and wrapped in bubble wrap, it still some how leaked. The bubble wrap was full of shampoo and sticky.",0
PARABENS?? Seriously??? With everything we know about parabens? Who would have known that you actually need to check the ingredients list before purchasing from such a well known brand. I read the reviews on their website and multiple people have criticized them for the parabens without any response. Really sad.,0
Great for dry course hair,1
"Hampton Sun SPF 15 Tanning Gel is in a very attractive container. It looks quite posh, for this type of product. Really it does. I thought it would be nice to give it a try, as I do a fair amount of gardening, and I walk to work and spend time outdoors. I like a wee bit of tan on my face in the summer. Why buy bronzer when you can get it for free, right? Now, on a particularly hot and sunny day I would want a product with a higher SPF. But since most of my outdoor forays are early in the morning, or fairly brief, I rarely feel the need for the high SPF products. This seemed like it might be a nice product to try.

I cannot say definitively if this actually works or not. I have a wee bit of color on my face, as I do every year at this time. I don't know if Hampton Sun SPF 15 Tanning Gel has protected me, or helped in any way. But it feels nice to apply,and is very light. And it is very posh looking, so if that matters to you, I say go for it. If you don't mind a multi-colored tube, that might be a better choice.",0
Did not buy this,1
"My hair is kind of long so I need to work on how I roll my hair into the curlers, but it looks beautiful like I just came out of a salon. I just put some mousse in my hair, blow dry, then put the curlers in. It doesn't burn my fingers and it take like 10 minutes! Love it, I would recommend it to everyone.",1
"Zirh Shaving Cream

P&G purchased Zirh in 2009 and made many product changes.  Consumers didn't like the changes and stopped buying the products and retailers dropped the Zirh line.  P&G dropped the Zirh line, which is currently being sold by TPR Holdings.

The new P&G formula that was released in 2009 is horrible, most retailers had stockpiles which lasted through early 2010, so many consumers didn't even realize that the product had changed until they got home.  Once it did change, sales associates at both Macy's and Nordstrom's said that they were getting multiple returns for the shave cream product.

Macy's and Nordstrom's dropped the Zirh line...

The primary ingredient in the old shave cream was Aloe Vera, the new crappy products main ingredient is water.  Which seems fraudulent to advertise the product as an ""extremely concentrated formula"" because the primary ingredient is water.  Also, stating that ""one jar should last up to 3 to 4 months"" is making a false statement as the new product would not last any longer than 8 weeks with regular use.  However, the prior formula would last 3 to 4 months for one person (I've used the old product since 2002 and purchased a large stockpile that ran out in June of 2012).

I don't know why they would continue selling the product with the new formula.

Fantastic,1
Don't know if I would like it or not--> package arrived with the liquid contents spilled all over the inside.  Impossible to use without the liquid.  Very disappointed and hoping replacement package will be better protected en route.,0
smells amazing and that is about it,0
I purchased this to replace an off-brand tan applicator mitt and this one seems sturdy and is easy to wash.,1
"I was excited to get such a big bottle for such a low price but now I'm upset. Usually when I wear Juicy, the perfume stays on my body/clothes for hours and I ever use a lot. With this product however, I have to basically shower in the perfume and the smell is nonexistent after two hours. I am very disappointed with this product.",0
"After trying this product I find it the most awful  smelling product and do not find it moisturizing at all, it gives me a dry feel on my skin  and I need to apply moisturizer right after. The salon that I purchased it from would not let me return it, so I'm stuck with it. If I could give it 0 star I would.",0
Mine ripped after a few uses but I did  hand wash it after every use so maybe it's only meant for a few uses. Other than that it helped apply the product pretty well,0
Good to go over another purple polish but you have to apply way too many coats for it to be a stand alone polish. Also it's not quite the color in the picture. It's more purple.,1
It was fine.,1
"Unfortunately, this ends up being very drying for my skin.  I tried it for a week, but I found that I was getting dry spots along my forehead and nose.  Once my skin began to feel itchy, I just gave up and bought my normal face cleanser from Sephora.  For $20, I was expecting more.  It looks like I'll be going back to Purity.",0
The  clay was nice and creamy broke down easily. It applied to the hair with little pulling. The hold was good and the product was matt. However the smell is awful and way to overpowering. I didn't even want to try it that is how overpowering the smell is. I was hoping the smell would die down in my hair but it failed to do so. I had to take a shower to get rid of the smell. When i bought this I thought the sweet tobacco  scent was a great idea but they just added to much fragance.,0
"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1
"Though I appreciate a company finally catering to different shades as well as skin tones, this is not my favorite full coverage concealer. I have had mine for about 6 months and: I find the product separating, the seal at the end of the plastic tube broke, I find it oily and difficult to achieve even coverage, it creases, and it doesn't stay very long. I love many other EM products, but I think this one needs to be reformulated. It is ok for medium to light coverage in areas that are not prone to crease and don't move around too much ie: forehead. The best full coverage concealer I've found is the ""full cover"" by Make Up For Ever.",0
"was recommended by my dermatologist, I like it, and the way it makes my skin feel. Not real sure it's doing anything, but I'll try the whole thing and probably order again",1
"I've used this for one month now and no miracles, this doesn't work for me",0
"I believe that this is not the real stuff. It made my eyes extremely irritated. They were red for days after using it once. The real product doesn't irritate my eyes. After inspection, I noticed the packaging didn't match the manufacturers.",0

Great product!  Fast ship.,1
The Batteries didn't last even 3 months and now this unit is not even charging. It was good till it lasted. How can this be repaired or replaced in Dubai?,0
"This lip color has staying power.  This lip color can read as a more dry than creamy feeling product but it is still comfortable and doesn't feel too drying or chapping.  It has just a hint of creaminess but for a more natural and moisturized wear  I like to apply a lip balm before I apply this and it still maintains a pretty solid staying power.  Though any additional moisture does lessen the richness of the color and the staying power it falls to desired finish and preference.  There is a pleasant scent to it but I have sensitive skin and it does not bother me. Bordeaux is a rich, brownish pink with a hint of wine but not so dark that it is not a daytime color for even a conservative wearer.  As the color fades it leaves your lips a pretty pink color which stays until you wash or purposefully remove it with a product. I think that it would be flattering to any skin tone and hair color.  I have extremely fair skin with yellow undertones dark hair and dark eyes and it compliments my complexion and adds a healthy look.  I would recommend this to any woman that wants a versatile dash of color that stays.",1
Great stuff! Works really well. 2nd time ordering !,1
Very confusing to get to operate.  Have to be an electrical genius; cannot get mine to work.  Sending back.  I would rather pay for immediate results if I am going to spend this much money.\,0
"As someone whos never really bothered with a set skin care routine as such, Ive got to say that Luna is a great way to get started. You use it with your normal face wash and kind of move it around your face. It even tells you exactly what to do by buzzing when its time to move to a new area. Not the most important thing, but it also looks really stylish!",1
"I'd like to start off by saying Shellac is incredible.  It lives up to all the hype - stays on for the full 14 days, doesn't chip, and comes off very easily.  However, the color in the photo is incorrect.  The seller has uploaded a photo of either Tutti Frutti or Hot Pop Pink.  Rose Bud is not a hot pink but rather a mid-range pink- in in between bright and pale pink.

Also note that you can only apply Shellac at home with the proper tools - it cannot just brush on like other polish so make sure you're aware of this.  You'll need the base and top coat from CND and you'll need the UV lamp.  I'd recommend going to a salon unless you're very familiar with nail design.  It generally isn't much more expensive than a traditional manicure with regular polish but stays looking perfect for so much longer.

5 stars for Shellac.  2 for this particular item listed because the picture is not of the actual product advertised.",0
"good but overrated and overpriced . actually most any shampoo does the trick because you don't really wash your hair; you wash your scalp, so the heading, ""shampoo for fine and normal hair"", is, i think, misleading . it does not have to be expensive to wash your scalp.",0
This stuff was a waste of $$$ it clumps on my edges. When you wipe it by putting gel in your hair it comes off on your hand. This is nothing like I thought it would be.,0
This is the only shampoo that keeps my hair shiny and manageable. I have well water and the minerals wreak havoc on my curls.  Malibu Hard Water Shampoo and Conditioner work like a dream!,1

great fir morining clear and after cleaning with another face clear,1
Great value and just like the one I buy at the salon.  Thank you.,1

"I have been struggling with dry facial skin as my makeup has been caking and flaking off.  Since I have started to use this product paired with the face lotion my skin is beautiful and it smells amazing.

I love most Mario Badescu products and will purchase more! I am currently using Paula Begoun and Mario Badescu. I have tried numerous creams. I am gonna stick to these products! I also love the chamomile toner, cellufirm drops, and i yet have to try my other Badescu purchases. will give an update. I have been recently diagnosed with eczema and this cream has done wonders with my sensitive, red, flaky, itchy skin. I love mario badescu skin care line!!!!!!",1

"My hairdresser turned me on to this wonderful oil. I use it most every night after I shower. I apply it to my damp hair so when I wake in the morning my hair is shiny, soft and tangle free. My hair is about 4 inches below my shoulder. The aroma of the oil is clean and very nice. It is not heavy ( on my hair). My hair is a little fine but I have a lot of hair. It is also highlighted. My hairdresser says my hair is in great condition and credits this product for some of that. She does note that some color treated blondes have mentioned their hair gets a bit brassy but I have not experienced that. It should also be noted that changing to the lighter oil seems to fix that issue, according to my hairdresser. My husband has started using this and gives it high praise, too. I will purchase it again and from this seller.",1
The product is a great concept but i'm not so sure is works.  My husband and I have used a few times now and we don't see a difference.  When I go get a professional facial I see instant result and I just don't get it with this product.,0
Pricey but works...just wish it were more cost friendly.  Won't be purchasing again.,1
"I have reddish brown hair with red highlights and it really didn't do anything except make my highlights orangey. My hair looks dryer after using the conditioner than it did before. Maybe I had high expectations for this product to give my color a boost. Unless your hair is very light, I wouldn't recommend.",0
"I got the wrong shade. Really disappointed, because I was very excited to use this tint. Definitely not worth the price unless you get shade matched first.",0
BEST smelling cologne ever!!,1
"I have been using Perricone products for 20 years and never had a problem with them.  I purchased this from
ShopXperts because there was a big discount of $30.00.  Now I know why.  The product is defective!!
Unfortunately, I purchased it in November 2013 and didn't start using it until recently because I still had
some left from my other bottle.  When I started using it, that's when I noticed it is pure liquid...NOT GOOD!!
It's supposed to be creamy.  Of course, since it is over 90 days they are not taking it back and instead of
getting a good discount, I lost $67.00.  I guess the old saying you pay for what you get is true.",0
"Love the product, even though it is rather pricey!",1
I believe it works only for very minor hair loss. In my case it was just a black powder to cover the scalp.,0
"I have two cans right now that do not work correctly.  They both squirt a small amount, then die.  Product dribbles down the sides of the can.  I've washed the nozzles/caps and have tried clearing out the aperture, with the same results.  Nothing works...and this is not the first time I've had trouble with their hairspray cans!  I did an online chat with Bosley, and the person gave me the number for customer service.  That person kept trying to schedule me for a consult.  When I finally got her to listen to me, she said that I would have to go to the person who sold me the cans.  Since this is a recurring problem, I (mistakenly) thought that the company itself would want to know.  Not.  Avoid this can!  Actually, I'm switching back to the Nioxin line.  I had better results with their products, and I know a hairdresser who is switching herself and her clients back to Nioxin after all of them tried Bosley.  Don't lose time (and hair), just go with Nioxin.",0
It seems to work ok but after the first use I had an allergic reaction to it and can't use it.,0
"Love this product. Excellent for travel; curls well without getting too hot.  Highly recommend for those who need to pack rollers without taking up your entire suit case. Also great for just using at home, little counter space.",1
"Nozzle did not spray,  will not order again.",0
"Very high quality product. Continues to work very well after 2 years. Arrived promptly, which is a usual (expected) Amazon bonus.",1
Didn't fit on my blow dryer,0
Mine arrived looking like it had been opened and missing the brush!,0
"I did not realize there would actually be specks of glitter in here! However, it looks really luminous under foundation in a good way (not like toy glitter spray or something). Can make your makeup a little pale.",1
"Not like my last order of soap....the stink is horrible.  I don't know what they did to change the smell, but I won't buy this product again and Ive been using this for years.",0
I feel like it works when I first apply it to my face but the stinging sensation fades after a fee minutes.  I think I need the stronger peel because I am more than halfway done with this container amd have not seen any results.,0
Its a lot small quantity than I expected.,0
"Makes a good lather, smells good and it's a light scent. Provides a good soap for shave.",1
"This product is suited for light conditioning and wasn't what I was looking for.  I needed a intensive conditioning product for split ends and dry fly-away  hair. But, if you need a good basic conditioner, this is a good choice and is better than grocery store brands in my opinion.",1
"I've been using this for about a week with some good success - I believe this only works if you are using it properly.

What You Need:
- A good routine...use it in the AM and PM. Make sure you use a gentle cleanser before (this is very drying - that's the purpose), and moisturize after.
- Less is better. A pea size is enough for your whole face. Any more will be VERY drying and cause more problems, increased oil production, etc.
- A good shaving routine - with a bad routine, this can help, but it won't clear you up unless you are doing everything properly beforehand.

Some people are complaining about the smell...I think it's pleasant. I don't see any of this 'blue film' on my face after using it either. I'll update again after a few weeks after I get a few more good shaves in.",1
Good condition and use iron it often would purchase again if I would need to.  Thank you for product quickly.,1
Works great on red and irritated skin. Very soothing and hydrating. My skin always looks less red in the morning if i use this before bed.,1
"The cleanser has been watered down or tampered with.  I have order this product several times through other sellers and have never had a problem with it.  This is NOT the same product,  the cleanser has a foul smell and is very watery.  I did not open immediately because was finishing another tube and passed the return date by a few days.  Horrible product and don't recommend product from this  seller.",0
"I've been using this eye gel for a while, and notice a difference in my under eye puffiness when I don't  use it.",1
Not happy with this product. I washed before first use as instructed and every time I use it it leaves black lint all over my face and does a sub par job of taking my makeup off. I should have went to Sephora and bought theirs for $12 and you get two!  Instead of $20 for one!  Rip off,0
Item came leaking in bag. Very displeased.,0
"I love the way this looks and feels on my skin, but the smell is just strange.",1
"Great product.  Smells like peppermint, Im not a fan of peppermint smells but its not overly strong and it doesnt last a long time after you're done washing your hair.",1
"So I saw this at walmart and didn't buy it...sadly. Then in Hawaii it was EVERYWHERE and when I got back to Cali I couldn't find it anywhere..I finally got it at an Ulta 25 minutes away but it was so worth it. This color is my favorite and it's one of a kind. IT IS NOT THE SAME COLOR AS IN THE PIC. It is much more blue than green...I'll add a link to the real image. This color is worth the buy and dries superrr fast! Only con is it occasionally chips and needs more coats at times..

[...]",1
"Either the product separated, or something else is wrong with it.  It should be a cream but is a tan liquid.  I tried shaking it to see if that would help, but it doesn't.  Returning it.",0
Works great with my hair.,1
"love this, best conditioner!",1
Makes my skin feel very tight and dry.,0
"I bought this hair dryer with high hopes. After exactly 6 months the dryer started stopping in the middle of the work and I have to wait few minutes until it cools down so I can continue drying my hair. Recently I am not able to dry even one small section without having it stop few times. I am unable to return it because I threw the box thinking that this dryer will last me years like my cheap dryer from Sally's that last me 10 years before it stopped blowing hot. for me, this buy was a waste of money and I am very disappointed with the buy.",0
Mine came with hair on it!!,0
"If hair is fine and thin with areas of balding, it does not  fill in as shown in TV primotion.  I brought smallest size to test results.",0
Seller was right on time with delivery. Love this product and color. Would highly recommend!,1
"""Natural"" would be the perfect color if you were an Oompa Loompa.  It has a very orange cast to it which doesn't work for my pale to fair skin tone.  I'm not sure it will work well for anyone, Ooompa Loompas excluded. The coverage is definitely buildable, the powder is finely milled, and if it were a wearable color, it would be great. The included application sponge is of average drugstore quality. The packaging is a little odd. The mirrored case gets covered with fingerprints very easily and therefore looks messy.  There is a clear plastic cover inside that hinges off of the powder that is awkward and feels flimsy.  I can't recommend this product.",0
I didn't see any change in my hair,0
love the smell! great shampoo would order again,1
"Bottom line: Opi Infinite Shine polishes are difficult to apply, but are pretty, so shiny, and more durable than traditional Opi polishes, although they are removed as easily as other Opi polishes. From Here to Eternity is a bright, happy color -- it is tropical and makes me smile and think of summer, despite the snow outside now. The Infinite Shine requires 3 coats of color to be opaque (=5 coats total, including base & top coats). These polishes are not forgiving, in that it is very easy to leave more bare spots, from working it too much; this is not the type of polish that you can brush on carefully to cover from top to bottom and side-to-side on each nail before it starts to set. This polish goes on best with minimal brushing, as 3-4 quick brush strokes per nail. The brush is as good as all Opi brushes and it dries quickly enough between coats but is overall more difficult to apply than the traditional Opi shades. After 3 days, I have noticed 1 tiny chip in my pedicure, but having tried the Infinite Shine shades several times, they look good for at least several days (and up to a week) longer than traditional Opi shades. I can get 2-3 weeks out of a pedi done in this color collection. The color is rich and deep, and shines nicely. Pretty Pink Perseveres is also lovely; it is a light pink that contrasts nicely, especially if you have darker skin tones.

If you are thinking about switching to Opi Infinite Shine, I am not sure it is worth the bother (or expense), unless you need new Opi colors -- because the Infinite Shine polishes are so frustrating to apply, plus switching requires the purchase of new top & base coats.",1
"I love the product.  In fact, they Proraso makes the cream they sell at Bath and Body Works.  I think it's called the CO Bigalow line.  Anyways, this cream lathers great with a brush in a bowl.  It smells great.  I think it works great.  The ONLY reason I won't give it 5 starts is because of the packaging.  The caps on these metal tubes is a soft plastic and breaks EVERY TIME.  That means you can't travel with this.  I wish they used a cheaper tube and a better cap, that way I didn't need to buy ""normal"" shaving cream/foam/gel for when I travel.",1
"Did not conceal my dark circles at all, no matter how much I applied.  And when I applied my finishing powder to my face as I usually do after my liquid foundation, it left my under eyes looking very wrinkled.  Also did not like the opalescent quality.",0
"Still have a tube and tub of this (don't ask), but I've been trying lots of other brands and finding things I like better. I'll go back to this every few days though as it is itself a great product, I just fell in love with some other scents and creamier formulations!",1
Toooo big. Feels like a hammer in my hands. I had to return it.,0
"SUPER UPSET

Worst colored mascara ever. It clumps, it is hard to remove, AND IT SUCKS. DO NOT BUY!",0
Works wonders on dry hair!  Helps make styling easier too!,1
Says spf on the product presentation but no were in the box says it is :(,1
Great product I will continue buying the Oribe products. Great Product I will recommended to my friends I will purchase it again. This product has everything I expected and more,1
Smells super awful!,0
love it!,1
"My hair holds curls pretty well. However, this does not keep my hair curly at all. I have to end up using a ton of hairspray which I had never had to before...",0
"Used the old 10% one for years, now smaller worse bottle and doesn't specify percentage along with parabens.",0
"I absolutely loved this curling iron for the first 2 months I had it. One day I went to use it, and noticed the tip was spinning around like it had melted away from the metal. I used it on my hair and immediately noticed a strong burnt hair scent.
The curling iron's heat settings had apparently gone crazy, and the iron burnt off a lot of my hair :(
I went back and read the 1 & 2 star reviews here on amazon, and noticed this has happened to several other people.",0
Invisible powder. Doesn't work.,0
Dont waist your money .,0
"I bought this product to stave off aging not because I was unhappy with my skin per we, you can never be too careful ;). I'm 40+ and an avid runner, the sun and sweat leave my skin a bit dry sometimes.  Been using this product at night on my chest neck and hands, love it. Can feel and see a difference.",1
Amazing soap.,1
Great for sensitive skin.,1
The cord is long it's thin like I wanted and it grrr real hot. Don't clinch down on the hair like I expected but over all its a good flat iron,1
"I bought this product for my wife but she has not had a chance to use it. It arrived in good time, well packed and in excellent condition but unfortunately it did not work. When plugged in to the power supply the pretty blue light on the front panel came on but that's all it did, no matter what button was pressed.
Inside the box there was a card from Nu Brilliance which said
""Do Not Return Your Nu Brilliance To the Store, We Can Help!
Please call our friendly customer service toll free at:
1-800-423-4248""
Well we did but it seems customer service was not that friendly after all, because they bluntly told us that they could not help and we should go back to the store, in this case Amazon.
So we went back to Amazon and to the seller, Your Party Delivered (YPD), and after a few email contacts we had a full refund, which we thank YPD for sorting out for us.
Not the result my wife wanted as she wanted to use the machine and get a result she wished for in the first place.
The moral of this story is you don't always get what you wish for and having seen some of the other reviews for this machine, its plain to see that there is a reliability issue with the Nu Brilliance system and until they can sort it out there will be a lot of disappointed people out there.",0
"Out of all the colognes I have had before in the past, this is the best smelling one I have purchased. Women will be throwing compliments and puntang at you everyday!",1
Color and consistency of makeup was great but packaging is so poor and product made me break out :( love stila though!,0
"I was excited to receive the SachaJuan Ocean Mist shampoo and conditioner after reading the reviews. I was so disappointed after my first use but thought I'd continue to use it and see if it would grow on me. It did not. This is very expensive for what you get. I have drug store shampoo and conditioner that smells so much better than this and performs better than this. The shampoo comes out gloppy like very cheap shampoo, not silky and smooth.  The conditioner doesn't really condition at all. As a matter of fact, I ended up adding leave in conditioner after my shower because my hair felt course and dry.",0
Love this... I would buy this product over Enzo Milano and cortex 4 in one.. the curls loosen and hair looks naturally curled.,1
I have tried this three different times with three different nailpolishes and cannot get it to peel. I end up having to use nail polish remover anyway.,0
"I like this blowdryer more than my last one. I research everything that I buy extensively, and after reading many reviews I settled on this one, even though the price was a little higher that the previous blow dryers I had purchased. It does work quickly and the only downfall to this model is the on/off button is easy to switch on accident while drying. I think it's still worth the price for the quality. Seems well made, so far. Overall, great product!",1

This cloth is amazing & really does work! All it needs is warm water! The only thing I don't like is the price! You can get them from an actual rep for $19.97 plus shipping which is usually $2-$3 with the same fast shipping!,0
"I am a long time Vichy user and always loved it. My nearby store was sold out on it and I ordered This Vichy here on Amazon, big mistake. I don't know what it is but it is certainly not Vichy Nutrilogie 2. It is a completely different substance, different smell, different result. This is my last attempt to buy any cosmetic stuff on Amazon.  Shame on you guys. You are not doing an honest business with cosmetics.",0
"Wonderful rose fragrance. A relaxing smell for the bath. Soothes this new mom after a hard day. Does not produce as many bubbles as I would like, but it's called ""milk"" and not bubble bath.",1
"I thought it was Ok. I read the review on the ""lathering ability"". One guy posted a picture of his cup over flowing with thick lather. I never achieved anything close to that. I tried, more/less water and I was only ever to get a medium to light lather. It was adequate for shaving but not what I was hoping for. The soap lasted a long time, several months so I certainly received my money's worth. As far as the container - disappointing. Very messy and the lid pops off easily. After shaving the cup is messy with soap, the lid won't stay on to rinse it off. Made a hot mess out of my travel kit. Nice idea, poorly executed.",0
"I ordered this in July 2017 and paid $60 for it. I decided to get a nicer professional dryer after having several lower end dryers go out after a couple of moths.  Unfortunately spending more money for a professional dryer didn't do any good.  This dryer only lasted 3 months before it started failing.  The motor on it started slowing to the point that it hardly blows even when I have it on the highest setting. I only use the dryer 3-4x/week so its not like it gets heavy use, especially since it is a ""professional"" product. After contacting customer service I realized this is just a Conair product with a ""professional"" label on it.  The only way to replace it under warranty is to send them more money along with the defective product and then wait 3-4 weeks for them to replace it- that is a long time to be without a hair dryer!  I was on the phone for an hour with customer service and they insisted that there was nothing else they could do for me and suggested that I go buy a cheap dryer while I wait for them to send me the replacement.  That is pretty poor customer service and I will definitely not be buying anymore Babyliss/Conair products in the future.",0
"This product may not be authentic, I've not had any improvement in my hair health when I use this product.
Also, if you use this product for protection when highlighting, the processing time is lengthened considerably, lift
is diminished and you are advised to go up a volume level. This is causing even more damage in my opinion.
I bought all three products and followed instructions. If you have very thick dark hair, perhaps it'll seem to help
for you, but really don't advise use if you have fine or fragile hair. Just use your typical products and a shorter
processing time, lower volume developer. This is my opinion after months of use.",0
SMOOTH,1
These didn't work for me. It made my gums burn too bad to keep using it. So I won't be buying it again.,0
One of my favorite Claus Porto soaps!,1
'Disappointed.  This smells nothing like any of the Devines Momo products I've used. It actually smelled like fish n plastic. 'Returning.,0
Comfortable and easy to use.  I don't even use a mug with this - the shape of the container coats the brush nicely for face lathering.  Excellent shaving soap.,1
"I have used Nioxin 2 for several years.  I would like to think it is helping with my thinning hair but who knows.  It ""seems"" to work.",1
Thought the size would be bigger; and not thrilled with the lash primer.,0
Nice iron,1
"I love everything about Essie this just ahppens to be my favorite color. Goes on nice, Comes off nice and last about a week or two depending how applied.",1
"This is an excellent iron.... Exactly as described.... Supposed to b safe on hair... Does the job (rapidly.)...
Dual voltage so u can use it anywhere in the world..
But the only problem is it reaches the temp after very long time (almost 45 seconds) compared to CHI & GHD which I used for 6-7 years back..
Otherwise it's much more better than these two .. Sliding easier.. Makes ur hair shiny much more... No comparison ..!",1
Very disappointed in this product. I bought it to be used while traveling due to the compact size. This item does not heat up as expected. Wish I could return this but it has been past the 30 day return window. This product does not work and I would not recommend to future buyers.,0
Excelente,1
"Well, I did like this curling iron a lot, but after owning it two years and using it probably once a week the purple paint began peeling off and I would find it in my hair so I had to throw it out.  Two years doesn't seem like a long time for a curling iron compared to all the others I've owned in my life.",0
Works well on colour and smells really good.,1
"I am actually reviewing this for my wife who is a member. She didn't realize that it was for men at first.  However, both of us have used it.  What we found is that it really left skin smooth and oil free (for hours).  It cleaned pores well and was easy to remove.  It wasn't however as good as other products we both had used except for the oil control - in that it excelled.  It gets a ""very good"" recommendation from both of us.",1
I was disappointed with the delivery and the vendor. The product arrived without its original packaging or seal. There is no way to verify if it is authentic. When I ordered the product nowhere in the description did it say that it was not in its original packaging or that it was opened previously.,0
"Very nice just need to take care around knees ankles and elbows. I have a salon in my home, customers really like the product.",1
It doesn't really give you curls its way way too big.... Not good for the price at all be careful.,0
ehhhh its alright :/,1
Makes me break out.,0
Super nourishing! Only 1 or 2 a week.,1
Love this oil!  My hair has never been better.  Love love love.  Would Highly recommend this product to all my friends.,1
Seems too sloppy for me,0
"The highlight is terrible quality and not very pigmented, I was disappointed.",0
"Miracle in a bottle!! Seriously! All my life I've had the occasional giant zit that and thought there was nothing you could really do about them since no other acne products I tried helped. This stuff literally changed my life! Whenever I feel one of those coming on, I put this on the area and it either completely stops it in its tracks or if the zit does prevail, it TOTALLY lessens the duration and severity by a mile! I can't say enough good things about this product. I hope it is never discontinued!",1
I used everyday for 4 weeks and no results. I have used other products for 2 weeks and obtained great results.,0
Not as I hoped,0
"Have been using it every night since I recieved it weeks ago.  I have not seen amazing results like I thought I would, no visible changes. Thought this would help with wrinkles or tightening the area, but has done nothing. I will not order again, paid too much for this.",0
This was a gift for a friend; she seems to like it a lot.,1
This is a really great styling tool! It does take some getting used to but is not hard to use at all. It makes beautiful curls that last all day. It gets very hot though so don't leave it on your hair for more than a few seconds to avoid scortching your hair!,1
not as good as the salon Cream.  it seemed watery.,0
I'm using this item as a watercolour paint box. The smaller wells hold over a half pan of paint and the larger wells are great for mixing washes. I removed the central plastic divider and clip on a larger flat plastic palette if more mixing space is required.,1
It appears that this product may have been tampered with. It is nothing like the original product I bought directly from Oribe. Disappointed.,0
Love glo minerals!!!,1

"This color is not as I perceived it would be, dreadful: ( Their polishes are great though, just not all the colors.",0
"Best hairdryer and brushes ever.  I have fine hair with a mind of it's own.  This leaves it smooth, long and silky. It lasts for days, even in this dry CA drought.",1
Not at all unscented.  My fiancee has odor-induced asthma and can't be near me if I use this product.,0
"My favorite, and I have tried a lot of hydrating face cleansers!  This is an invigorating, spa like treatment for a daily wash!",1
"Normally this gel is gel-like. This time it's very watery, disappointed.",0
"Smells so good.  This is excellent soap, so luxurious, and it's for both men AND woman.  Everyone who has used it has asked me where I got it.",1
"My favorite perfume is Acqua di Gio by Giorgio Armani, but this one isn't too bad either. I wore it one day and while the scent is a bit strong for my taste, I wouldn't mind using it when the Armani fragrance runs out. Now if I had to choose between the two, the Armani is a clear winner. I've gotten several compliments and questions about that one which I doubt I'll get with this one. This one has a scent that's a bit too common in my opinion. It smells overly sweet and a bit spicy while the Armani is refreshing.

Overall, not bad at all but there are definitely better options out there.",1
Product does not worK as advertised. Save your money and buy a toupee!,0
very healthy for hair,1
This color is absolutely hideous.  It looks like I have pennies on all of my fingers.  I was expecting this to be a gold glittery polish but I was wrong.  Its a pure copper color and does not look good with pale skin tones.,0
AWFUL.  Made my hair even frizzier which I didn't know was possible.  Total waste of money.,0
"Works well when put on wet hair.  Not a stiff hold, but it does a good job of making my super fine hair semi-behave.  Smell is OK.  Not really floral, but not off-putting.  Has a bit of a glitter sheen to it which requires heavy duty hand washing after application. Bottle does not travel well in luggage.  I bought a travel bottle as it leaked a little on my first trip.",1
This product did nothing for my wire like gray hair coming in.,0
I usually buy this from a local beauty store but they were out so I ordered it online. It appears it is old or something as it didn't have much product left in it and I had to buy another one within a week.,0
"I tried this and the Kiehl's Facial Fuel lotion. The MenScience brand definitely worked better for me, less greasy and light. My only complaint is it's too pricey, although a little goes a long way.",1
Everything good as expected.,1
2 coats and a topcoat and still it chipped.  Thought at this price it would be better quality polish but no!,0
Best row water spray I've used! Doesn't leave my face greasy in this Florida humidity yet moisturizes so it's not tight and itchy,1
It works well on adult acne.,1
I haven't used this particular color; I have so many other options.  Just from the stand point of the container it's a  beautiful hue of pale purple.,1
love it,1
"I've been searching for the perfect eyebrow ""supplement"" for years now, and I think I may have finally found the one for me. My hair is a dark blonde/very light brown color, and this blonde pencil is perfect for me. It gives just enough color to make my eyebrows more defined, but doesn't darken them too much. It glides on effortlessly and blends in with my eyebrows beautifully, so I definitely don't feel like my eyebrows were drawn on. It looks very natural, stays all day, yet washes off easily (although I do use a cleansing oil to take off my makeup, and that takes off just about anything effortlessly). My only complaint is that the sharpener, which is AWESOME, only works with this microsized pencil. I had hoped maybe I could use it for my eyeliners as well, but it's definitely smaller in size than a normal eyeliner pencil sharpener so it will only work with this pencil. Oh well, at least it comes with it's own sharpener. All in all, this is a great little pencil and I will not hesitate to purchase it again.",1
"This stuff has saved my life. It's so gentle but you feel like you get a really great clean. I recommend using this with a routine with toner, and night cream/sunscreen.",1
Best base coat ever!  Before a friend recommended this product to me I could never keep polish from chipping off my nail tips - now I'm good until my next mani!,1
I ordered this brush originally and received something different.  I notified the company and they refunded me the money.  I ended up not reordering because I had found another one at a local store.  It was disappointing to get the wrong item.,0
"These pads leave a sticky and oily residue on my skin.  Not what I want on my already oily face!  Have used glycolic acid for years and these didn't give much of a tingle or do much to improve my skin.  I liked the ease of the pads, but chose to return them.",0
"Did not cover my (light) under eye circles, just doesn't contain enough color pigment. It is creamy, I liked that hence the two stars.

Build quality is terrible!  No match for my very thick hair! Iron gets so hot when I curl my hair the release thumb gaurd actually bent..... bent so much now it's unusable bc it won't open.  I've pushed it back up again several times but keep doing this and it will surely break off eventually. My conair I've had since high school has never done this to me and has always performed extremely well. Going back to the cheap drug store irons. And don't even get me started on hot tools blow dryers or flat irons. Joke and the biggest waste of my money! They simply can not stand up against my thick hair!!,0
Not worth $42 for a tiny bottle. It comes in a huge box and feels heavy but the bottle is just thick glass to hold less oil. The bottle is extremely small. Smells nice though.,0
Love this pink! It doesn't really last 7 days for me - but longer than regular polish.,1
After reviewing the ingredients--it is a pretty high price to pay for spring water filled with silicones! You would be better off using a serum which is truly organic with natural oils in it for your skin.,0
Like the color. Wish I could find even darker blue of product on Amazon. Took to my salon and they applied it for me. Has lasted over 3 weeks.,1
"There was something wrong with it.  It smelled ""stale"". I had a sample of it which is why I bought it that smelled amazing.  I returned it right aeay",0
because I order a lot through Amazon I do not review many if any products. but I have to tell you this is one awesome customer service company. I purchased my Tria lazer through Amazon. 3 months later it is not acting appropriate. I email customer service at the Tria website. They have me a new device within a week. I truly would recommend this product with this company. They will make it right if something is wrong.,1
"Good price but fragrance is very weak, and does not smell the same as I got from younkers VERY disappointed in it -Paul Loitz",0
"I must first say that I have no liaison with this company nor have have I received a free device or monetary compensation for this review.
I must also say that I have had about 6 professionally done laser treatments on my legs and bikini area by the time I started using this device.  I did however, still had thick black hair growing everywhere (it was even worse before the professional treatments).  I have done about 4 full body treatments with this device and I can certainly notice the difference.  It's not as effective as professionally done treatments with a good aesthetician, however, for the price and convenience of not having to make appointments and pose naked in front of someone it's well worth it.  You have to be attentive and thorough when zapping yourself.  You must realize that the lamp area isn't as big as the entire head of the machine so there will be a margin area that will not get zapped.  The more surface area that you leave unzapped, the poorer your results will be.  So it's up to you to be thorough without over-zapping yourself and potentially damaging your skin.  I like to use a pen to create grids on my skin so that I know where i have zapped and where I have not.  Call me anal but this is how you will get the best results.  Expect about 10-20% hair reduction per session.  Be realistic and patient.  Do not expect to be completely hair free in a couple of months.  Give yourself about a year of well-performed treatments (depending on your hair type) and you will see great results!  I have dark long hairs on my arms (which did not have previous professional treatments) and after 4 treatments with this device I've had about 40% hair reduction, which I'm quite happy about.  I would have given this device 5 stars if it was a tad bit more effective, you didn't have to wait 3 seconds between zaps, and if the head did not have a margin of plastic around the lamp which makes it trickier to measure the zap area.  I'm overall happy with my purchase and do recommend it.

P.S. I always used the highest zap setting on all my treatments and I cannot attest for any of the other settings!",1
Best dry shampoo out there,1
I had to return this curling iron as it burnt my hair on a medium setting.  Amazon's return policy is terrific!,0
"This works for me, but only if I completely saturate my hair and leave it on for at least an hour.  I'd love to get the No. 1 and 2 to get the full treatment and benefits.",1
"Would live to say that this was the best hair dryer diffuser I have ever used... the problem?  The ""universal"" diffuser would not fit either of my blow dryers, which are your basic brands and sizes. The diffuser must be used with a dryer that is either narrow or tapered. It appears to be a quality product, but doesn't meet my needs and is destined for the charity bin.",0
This scent is awesome!,1
cheap product - pulls your hair and has a cheap design since the edges aren't flat,0
Quit getting hot after 5 months.,0
Love it!! Great frangrace,1
"I can't be sure, but it doesn't seem like the real hot tools iron.  I have another one bought from the makeup store, and it works great without a problem.  This heats up weird (sometimes too hot, sometimes not enough), doesn't curl well, got some build-up on it that can't be cleaned off (which doesn't happen on the other iron).
I'm giving it a 2 rating just on the off chance that it is user error, but I seriously doubt it.",0
It does not work for me,0
My hairstylist told me to purchase this and apply this at home but theres nothing special about it. It's basically overpriced hair conditioner.,0
"In my twenty five years of barbering i never seen a better looking clipper not only looks great but works great.
The best pair of clippers made in  years .",1
Love it,1
"We have many allergies in our house, and the scent on these cloths is one of them. Would be great if these were fragrance free, but as is they are unusable for us and possibly dangerous to those with more severe allergies. Caution to those.",0
Burns my hair.  Even on the lowest setting.  I have very fine gray hair and it really made it a frizzy mess.  Very disappointed.  :(,0
Great way to cover roots between colors!,1
Cheap,0
great dryer - dries my hair quickly - just a tad too heavy but getting used to it. Want to know where my warranty card or sign up is?,1
Best price found!,1
Not worth $28.00........Did nothing for me. I love L'Occitane products and was VERY disappointed in this one. VERY!,0
I wasn't as happy with this scent than others I have bought. To me there was very little scent at all.,1
"Just lovely, my go to hand soap in all my bathrooms.",1
"Although I like other items in this brand, I do not like this cream. It is too thick for me and feels heavy.",0
I liked a sample i had gotten before. This did not seem like the sample.  Did get great customer support from the seller.,1
"I like Replenix, however the bottle I just received in May, 2015, expired in September, 2014. Hassle to send it back and I refuse to pay $60 for an outdated product. To bad, I will purchase elsewhere",0
"Well, unfortunately, I am allergic to this because it has menthol in it. Shame on me for not checking before ordering. However, my mother, who is in her 60s loves this. Shes been putting it on her face and neck every morning after she washes her face. She says it stings a little, but not too much. About the same sting as if you get toothpaste on your face. She cant put too much on her face around her eyes because the fumes burn her eyes a little. This serum seems to be helping with the fine lines on her face, but where we really notice a difference is on her neck. She puts it on every morning on her neck and the skin is noticeably tighter and less-wrinkly. Now Ive got mom hooked, and shell be buying more.",1
"I'm going to have to side on the same side as some reviewers who question the authenticity of this product. I first tried a sample of this oil from a beauty box and LOVED it! Suddenly my curls were like BAM! So I found this on Amazon, and for the price thought it was too good to be true. Ladies - (or gentlemen, I don't discriminate)... it is.

The first few times I used this I thought it smelled juuuust slightly different than my sample, but I figure maybe more product... we can rationalize anything. Then my boyfriend pulled me aside one day and asked me why my hair was flaking. Uhh... What do you mean by flaking exactly? He started to pull out pieces of the product (clear and plasticy looking). That's when I knew this was not working.

It seems like product dries and flakes off. It's gross. And it doesn't give my curls nearly the same bounce or love that my sample did. I'm disappointed and think the seller should pull the product if it isn't authentic.

For the price though, give it a shot. Seems like plenty of people have been happy with this. But I warn you - you could end up with flaky hair.",0
very disapointed in my Straightner.  sounds like its breaking the ends off my hair when i pull it through and doesnt straighten my hair well at all. Minutes later i have friz..,0
This arrived on time and was exactly as stated. Live the color. This product wears very well last a whole week.,1
"It quits working after several months of use.  This was my second one, thought I would try it again after the first one.  Well the same thing happened, plugged it in and it wouldn't work.  Loved the brush but will not continue to buy this piece of junk.  Usually three strikes out this is a two strikes you're out!",0
"Good product, shipped promptly, thanks",1
"Heats up fast. Only an off and on, no temperature control, when wiping clean paint comes off too.",1
love it,1
"I really, really wanted to love this product, but it was a horrible experience for me. I will say I have sensitive skin and I wear contacts as well, so that may have contributed. This stuff kind of melts when you rub it in, and it always seemed to run into my eyes. I have tried other eye products but this is the only one that always seemed to get into my eyes, and boy, it stings! After a week of hoping for the kind of result the lady wrote about ( where it was instant and so profound she almost peed and had to run out of the house to show her husband) I gave up. I also had very dry under eye areas and a few days after I discontinued use, I got an eye infection. Don't waste your money on this garbage. If, like me, you have serious dark circles and thin skin under your eyes, try to get a hold of something called Borba orbital eye rejuvenator. It is no longer made, but eBay has it sometimes. It can be pricey, but it is the best stuff I've ever used on my eyes.",0
Loved the color for the Spring and Summer. OPI does it everytime!,1
Works great on white heads.,1
My absolute favorite brand of lipstick.,1
not so great,0
Only bought because some said it's great,0
"The color looks lighter than described. I have dark brown hair and this looks more like a milk chocolate color. The spray makes your hair very gritty and rough to the touch. I don't recommend using this on clean hair as it will make your hair hard and prevent it from flowing naturally. This also transfers A LOT. It will get all over your fingers and might even transfer to your forehead if you're not careful. Also, when you shower it looks like you're washing out hair dye. I used it several times to give it a fair chance, but overall I would not purchase this again.",0
"Hello ladies...

I marked the previous lady's review as helpful because it is... I do agree with her... that while she may have been using it for a few weeks she didn't  get results.... I also had been using it for weeks but failed to see any results literally until the 5-6th week.....and the results are quite impressive I have sleep insomnia frequently, and fine lines and dark circles run in my family and at my early age of 28..... so with that said.. I would advise other ladies to buy the product yes.. but be FULLY COMMITTED to applying it nightly... for at least 6 weeks.... Ive been doing it for 6 weeks and I still have quite a bit of product left... I actually purchased mine from QVC so I paid more than what it is sold for up here, for just 1/2 an oz...and i can def say its worth it..... I have tried arbon i think its the intense eye repair its orange and that is good..and works literally in 3 days at most...however if you miss a night of application it will be apparent the next day.... not so much with this Dr. Perricone.... The effects seem to be long lasting, not to say that if you stop using for a week or so your eyes won't go back to having fine lines, but thats with any of the best products/procedures on the market, they require maintenance....I gave the product 4 stars because of the time factor. Besides that I am pleased with my purchase. I can say Im on the bandwagon of devout Dr. Perricone anti aging fans...Its good stuff...just be patient. :)",1
"I have to be in the mood for this fragrance to tell the truth. It's very sweet, and unique. Trust me you've never smelled this one before. If you're looking to stand out and differentiate yourself then I'd suggest you buy this. I would recommend this as a date fragrance. Girls will definitely appreciate this smell and give you compliments. I have a lot of cologne so last summer I used this as my signature  work fragrance for a a while. And I can tell you that it gets compliments!",1
"Best makeup ever.  I have been using Jane Iredale for more ten years.  My shade is just perfect for my skin.  It looks silky and smooth, not powdery.  This makeup also helps dry up blemishes, and it has enough SPF to save me from casual sunburns on my very fair skin.  I was glad to see this product on Amazon, and at a better price than other places I have bought it.",1
Best body soap on the market.,1
I am underwhelmed.,0
Great company.  Been using their products for a bout two years.  My favorite hair products.,1
"I have dry eye syndrome really bad (I have to use restasis, etc.) and for probably ten years I didn't use mascara.  It seemed to dry my eyes out and I couldn't make it a full day before washing it off.  I did some research and found that tube mascara can be tolerated by some of us who have dry eyes, so I started using the Blinc tube mascara and was very pleased.  Then I saw this primer from Blinc and have been happy with it as well.  It volumizes my lashes and then I put the mascara over it and it works well.  No, it will not crazy volumize or lengthen like a regular mascara, but I am just so thankful to be able to wear ANYTHING on my eyes that I am thrilled.  I'm attaching a picture to kind of show how it works in my lashes.  Sorry it's not clearer!",1
"This was barely used because the battery only lasted about a week before it would die. A year outside of the warranty period, I went to plug it in, and all it would do is vibrate. The light did not come on indicating it was charging. After leaving it plugged in for a half hour, all it continued to do was vibrate. When I called CLairsonic, I was told that the only thing they could do for me was offer to have me purchase another one for $60. Um. No thank you. I spent over $100 on this sucker--it shouldn't die this quickly--particularly since it was barely used.",0
"I have used this product for nine days and have seen NO changes in my skin. NO fading of dark spots, not even the slightest bit. Will continue using until the bottle is gone but at this point I am not hopeful this is going to work. I was hoping to see some fading after the first week. Will post an update when I've finished the bottle..

I finished the entire bottle and not even the slightest hint of fading of any brown spots whatsoever.. Complete waste of money",0
"I purchased this in ""Cameron"" and while I tend to like light nude lipsticks but this was quite chalky.",0
The iron is good and hits quickly but the hair dryer is not as fastest and powerful as a profesional dryer should be.,0
Very thick and leases a residue on anything it touches.  I like the fact that it is safer than others but disappointed.  I had read that it absorbs well but unless I have weird skin...that is not the case.,0
"I got this as a bonus with the healing oil hair treatment. I absolutely love it and now I am going to purchase the full size bottle. It creates volume as well as definition. It dries almost immediately. You can tell it is high quality. I never thought I'd spend this much on hair spray, but it's more than actually just hair spray because it gives my curls definition. Highly recommend!",1
FYI: I was super excited about this face wash only to find out the distributer sent the more expensive serum. SMH,0
I wanted a cruelty-free non-greasy face sunscreen that was spf 50. This is pretty greasy. It is no where near matte after any amount of time and and doesn't seem oil free because of that. It also has a cloying smell that I find to be unpleasant because it's so strong. I'm not buying it again and I'm using the rest on my body because the smell bothers me less when it isn't on my face.,0
"After 2 uses, it becomes clogged and will no longer work. I am now on my 6th one in the same month! Several others report the same issue with the applicator. It's poorly designed.",0
Love pureology. My hair is so much thicker than before. (like when I was a child). Leave in conditioner smells great and no sticky feel. Happy to have added to my routine.,1
I got the wrong product!  I paid for the XL and received just the normal size...1102. I was in a hurry when it came in and needed to use it. That's why I needed to use my Prime. I didn't notice when I opened the package but as I used it I thought it didn't seem any different or longer. I turned over the iron and saw the model. It was the same one that just went out on me on Saturday. I could have spent less money if I wanted the regular length. Ugh. So annoyed!  Plus they put their sticker over the 1102 model number. You can see it in person.  Crazy,0
It wasn't the color I expected. I plugged the item number in even.,0
"it doesnt work. Whenever i place the machine against my skin and press the button, it blinks orange. Forgot to mention im pale skin. Im very dissapointed.",0
"Love the wipes, but the spray is like putting food color on your face. Doesn't work as tanner. I'll keep buying the wipes and be happy I found them.",0
"My wavy, spirally hair is fairly fine. I've used other Ouidad products and liked them, but this spray really does nothing at all, not even de-tangle my hair.  If anything, my hair is unusually frizzy after using this product.",0
"Makes the best curls, even with hair that usually doesn't hold curls. This wand is better than any curling iron.",1
Smells gross and has fake colors and chemicals. I dumped it and kept the bottle,0
"i have been using this product as directed for 5 months and show no signs of hair loss. If it sounds too good to be true, it is. Lesson learned.
I agree with the person who said it must be family and friends writing good reviews. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! You will regret it if you do.",0
"I bought these because the visuals in the advertisement suggested that the curlers could be heated by blow dryer ( picture of curlers + blower dryer with caption of ""complete system"") and there was no product description indicating otherwise. I now learn that they need a heating base costing hundreds. This is clearly not the travel solution I was looking for. Wasted money.",0
Used this product for years. The results Do Not Last More than a few hours and at DOUBLE THE PRICE ITS NOT WORTH IT. Save your money!,0
"I like this produdt, have been using for a long time.
Yes, I would recommend it for those who use cream deodorant. .",1
"I feel like I will never be able to find the perfect mascara, but I can't complain too much with this one. It goes on pretty easily and stays on all day. Sometimes it can be a bit clumpy though, so I wouldn't call it spectacular, but it does make my lashes pretty long and thick.",1
"My skin has always been very sensitive and prone to acne, so I was leery about using this product because I thought it might be too heavy for my skin. Thankfully, it's been great to use and has caused absolutely no breakouts. Truth be told, I was expecting it to be more moisturizer than sun screen, but I feel the opposite is true, so it might be best for Spring/Summer when you don't want a heavy moisturizer.",1
"I received a sample of this in my ipsy glam bag.
Its a really nice serum with a lovely texture that leaves skin feeling soft and supple, but although I only tried it for a few days, I am not exactly sure i can really see any superior benefits over other less expensive serums.
-extremely light, liquid consistency
-absorbs quickly without any stickiness or residue
-doesn't leave skin shiny
-can be put on under make up
-leaves skin feeling soft and supple and nourished
-not really a moisturizer and no skin plumping
-the most amazing mild coconut smell",1
Good hold on curl.,1
"Battery goes bad and is not replaceable.  Clarisonic will only replace it for the warranty period, after that it has to be thrown away.  Mine died in less than two years.",0
"I received the RevitaLash Advanced today and was disappointed to find the product's cellophane covering had been removed and replaced with a badly-fitting plastic bag sealed with scotch tape.  Since the cellophane had been removed, I am returning it.  There is no expiration date on the box.  Possibly it was on the original cellophane?  I don't want a product that appears to have been opened or old.  The RevitaLash should have been wrapped in it's original packaging.",0
What's with the price increase? no way.,0
When I ordered this product before there was another shade-Light and it wasn't available this time so I am not really happy with the product because it is slightly too dark for my skin tone,0
"I ordered this product because I used a sample given to me by my dermatologist. I LOVED the product when I sampled it- it was moisturizing without appearing oily and the tinted quality allows me to not wear makeup but I appear as though I do. However, when I ordered the product it was nothing like the sample. It made my face feel SO dry so I started wearing an additional daily moisturizer underneath it and my face still felt dry. This morning I noticed my skin cracking above my eyebrows. I have never had dry skin issues, or any skin issues for that matter. I wonder if they changed the formula. I do not recommend this product.",0
Great product for my skin with acne.,1
This stuff is great - this is my 2nd purchase & there will be more.  It really is a treat & works well & smells/tastes great!,1
I love the smell of this face wash. The only thing I wish is that it did was exfoliate more to help get off more dead skin.,1
Been using this for 3 months now. Maybe there was a small amount of reduction. More likely wishful thinking than anything. I'll keep trying and hoping I didn't spend a whole lot of money and time with no results.,0
This is great night cream! It has eliminated breakouts and keeps my skin soft and smooth. An awesome product.,1
This stuff makes me greasy and I break out when I use it.,0
Doesn't stick. Even just after applying it.,0
"Although i love the scent it left my hair sticky. And im not really picky,so draw your own conclusion.",0
I think I like it so far. Not like the old self tanners. No ORANGE! A subtle golden look.,1
Fake.  I have used this Moroccan Oil for several years and knew something was off when I opened this.  Scent all wrong.  Very heavy compared to the real thing.  Returned.,0
Opened the jar and it didn't have the usual coconut smell. The jar was not sealed so I have no idea if it was tampered with. The consistency was also a bit thicker than usual.,0
the concentration of actual argan oil here is very low. you can get better products for this price. It's basic serum mixed with a little bit of argan oil and a rat poison preservative... don't get me wrong I still used it till it was done but I won't waste my monet again,0
"The photo of the product makes it look like a deep red. It's not. The nail polish that I received and applied to my nails looks more like a burnt orange/brown color. Very disappointed.

Also, you can totally just buy the top coat and use it with regular nail polish and it'll last a week that way too, I've done that before.",0
great stuff,1
I like this product.  It makes my hair shiny and does seem to prevent split ends.,1
My skin performed better with Retinol and tea tree oil. I tried it twice. It was drying my skin out and was leaving lines. I'm dark chocolate. I hated all the restrictions on other beauty mainstays like no waxing or Retinol etc.,0
Received and more than half of the product was replaced with some sort of liquid. Paid full price for only a fraction of what I was supposed to receive. Very disappointed.,0
"Love this soap! So rich and smooth, it lasts longer than anything store bought. Wonderful scent as well.",1
was too sheer for me.,0
This worked for me. It gives a nice glow!,1
I bought this for my son.  It doesn't cause him to break out but does have a mild odor that he doesn't like.,1
"This is the second Hot Tools Digital flat iron, Pink Titanium item I've purchased that stopped working after using it for just 2mos.  Very unhappy with this product and will look to get reimbursed this time.",0
This is my second Elchim dryer.  The only reason I bought another one is that my daughter moved out of my home and took the original. It was about 2 years old and still going strong.  Its easy to use and drys my thick hair quickly.  I highly recommend it!!,1
I like this remover! it not tense after wash,1
"So I somehow managed to do it on my own without causing more damage to my hair And actually made it look healthier and fuller. If you haven't gone on a treatment before or have no idea how the long process goes then I wouldn't suggest you do it on your own and just let the professionals do it. But if you really want to save big time then do it at your own risk.  the only downside about this product is that it says is good for permed hair, I waited a year and a half and let may natural hair before using this product. I have very thick hai so I thought it can manage the chemicals however, I ended up cutting 4 inches off which isn't a big deal since i have long curly (permed) hair. all in all, I will definitely use this product again and also follow instructions carefully",1
"I use to buy meaningful beauty until I discovered this product from my sister in law. While I was happy with meaningful beauty this product is like developing new skin. Leaves my face feeling smooth, hydrated, and smaller pores. The cloth gives a nice deep clean. Definitely worth every penny",1
a bit expensive for the volume you're getting but it is a good light hold gel.  i'm not sure if it really thickens or gives the illusion of thickening but i'm trying it out along with the other nioxin hair products in the hope that it works.,1
"I've used this product for several years, but the product in bottles that I purchased this time was a different color and It was clearly not the same high quality product that had purchased before. Does not work at all.",0
"Not particularly moisturizing on my very dry skin. Scent is very strong and very perfume-y, smells like an old Avon product.",0
Love this hairdryer.  I have think shoulder length hair and I section if off to dry.  This dryer does the job in a vey efficient manner.  My stylist only uses Rusk so I thought I would give it a try. Only negative is the concetrator will fall off from time to time which can be a pain b/c it just slips on with no lock in.,1
Love it,1
This cream cleanser is perfect for my sensitive skin.  It also removes make up.  Great before bed.  A little weird for me not to lather and rinse but I am getting used to it.,1
Has the bad hairspray smell. Wish I could return.,0
Very fast delivery.  Works good but I like the smoothing conditioner better I have curly hair and other works better for me,1
i love it,1
"I had my husband test this product for me because I figured his exceptionally manly stubble needed a quality grooming product to help manage it.  Here are his thoughts:

Ive always looked on the Art of Shaving stores with the exact kind of Nostalgia I think the company wants me to feel -- its old fashioned, right? The REAL kind of shaving weve forgotten, thanks to electric shavers, disposable razors and bottled product. This (rather expensive) starter kit promises to give me all the basics I need to shave like a proper gentleman.  I think the $20 shaving kit I picked up at Walgreens does just as good (if not better) of a job.

The kit has the four elements of a perfect shave -- prepare, lather, shave and moisturize -- as represented by a pre-shave oil, a bucket of shaving cream with a brush and a post-shave lotion. These replaced my normal kit (a cheap brush, soap and bowl from the drugstore) for the duration of the review. Things went bad immediately.

My normal routine has me shaving immediately post shower, when my skin is still hot from the steam and easy to shave. I normally run my shaving soap under some hot water, and apply the frothy warm mixture to my face. I run my safety razor across it a few times. It glides painlessly. Im done. This did not happen when I used the Art of Shaving kit -- instead it was painful not smooth and my skin hurt when I was done.

So whats the deal? I blame temperature. As near as I can tell, the kit actually contains pretty okay product, but its all cold. It ruins my hot, shower-fresh face by covering it in a cold oil and a cold lather. The shave isn't smooth. Its painful. Its cold. It doesnt work. Its a pun I cant avoid: The Art of shaving isn't found in a kit, its a process. This set interrupted my process. It does not work for me. It would probably be better if you bought an expensive lather warmer and, hey, guess what? Art of Shaving sells those, too!

The contents itself seem okay. The pre-shave oil is oily, the lather is lathery, I guess (though I found it dried out my skin, making the lotion necessary) the post-shave lotion is very moisturizing. The brush seems fine, but it requires a lot of washing--the thick shaving cream sticks to it, and doesnt come out with an easy rinse. Ill probably keep using it with my old soap.",0
I had a little filler injected which resulted in some faint green bruising and wanted to cover it...  thought this should do the dtrick but there was very little coverage whatsoever.,0
"I thought this was going to be a red with a lot of glitter in it, but it really is just a glitter top coat.  Nevertheless, I really do like the effect, and would recommend it for anyone looking for a bold glitter.",1
This is the first straightener I have used. I like it.,1
"At first you think it wont, but it ends up looking amazing. Great product for my beard. Helps shaping it.",1
Great stuff,1
Not the same. Scent!!  I have been using product for years and it just is not the same to me!,0
"The best products, ever!",1
"Gooey, large particles, would not stick to my scalp. Returned product.",0
Nice scent fresh,1
"Very handsome masculine scent - a friend has used it for years and I decided to try it  and love it.  It's a nice fragrance, but is not overpowering.  Highly recommended.",1
This product works so well to cover gray hair in between your coloring.  I just wish they sold refills instead of having to buy the whole case every time. It is a waste.,1
"This stuff is amazing, great ingredients, doesn't break me out/dry me out. A little pricey but I always return to it!",1
No shine on dry hair at all. Scent was yuk.,0
Does not work as well on break-outs as thought.,0
"OPI's My Private Jet is supposed to be dark charcoal/black with silver sparkle.  Instead it's a frayed dark brown with silver sparkle.  I think it probably looks good on those with a warm skin tone but I'm not thrilled with it on my cool, pink under toned skin.  Essie's Tribal Text-styles is a blacker base with silver sparkles that works better for those with cool toned skin.  I think the Essie wears better in this case too.  I got 6 days without chips with the Essie Tribal Text-style and only 3 with the OPI My Private Jet.",1
Huge and bulky--nearly burnt my hair!,0
"Bliss wax? The name is not fitting! It was painful and if you didn't work quick enough, the wax hardened too much to use. Having to reheat it wasn't very convenient.",0
"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1
"Great cost and yes, really 20% glycolic acid. Will order again!",1
This is much darker than it looks. Dark brown not taupe,0
"Excellent shaving experience!  Very aggressive razor, however, only needed 1-2 passes to get a great shave.  Net results, less time on the face = minimal or no razor burn or irritation!!!",1
"this item came with a faulty push pump. it does not function, request an additional pump be sent....",0
Not what I expected... When I see chrome I expect shiney. This is just silver,0
Just trying it now....will know more later,1
OMG! This stuff is good! Doesnt smear.  Love it,1
love it!,1
"I had a french manicure at a Ritz Carlton in FL using all the Vinylux products. Being on the beach, swimming/sunscreen & sand the manicure literally lasted all week, which prompted me to buy the very same products as soon as I got home. Disappointment! I don't know what is different, but w/ less wear & tear on my nails being home, I'm lucky if I can get 2-3 days before it chips. Won't purchase again.",0
"This iron created great curls but they didn't hold.  By the time I was done curling all my hair the first curls had lost most of their curl.  I switched hair products thinking that might be the problem -it wasn't.  When I went back to using my old Hot Tools iron (not ceramic titanium) the curls held. Sadly, I have to return the iron.",0
"I have tired many different types of shaving creams and this one was not the greatest.  It's ok, but not as nice as I wanted.  In my opinion, I didn't like the strong scent of menthol that comes with this product.  Others said they liked it, but I don't, like I said it's too strong.",0
"I ordered this because of all the great reviews on it.. but I wasn't impressed at all. The texture is very light and kind of.. greasy? I haven't seen much difference once using this eye cream, except that after using it for a few weeks I ALWAYS get little bumps under my eye. I'll stop using it for a few days or a week until the bumps disappear and start using the eye cream again, and the bumps come back every time. I would NOT repurchase this again. By the way I have oily skin, especially in my T-zone, although my undereyes are dry. My main eye concerns are dark circles and eye bags, not so much wrinkles right now as I'm only 26.",0
I will definitely not use this product again.  I have very sensitive skin and this over-priced product caused red bumps to appear on my face within seconds of applying it.  It took several days for my skin to completely heal.  I'll stick to Neutrogena's oil free moisturizer for sensitive skin.  This has been my go-to moisturizer for years.  It's never irritated my skin or caused acne.,0
Feels super thick and dry in hair. Yuck.,0
"I have always worn hair gel because if I don't I look like a Q-tip head.  I have tried many brands over the years.  I just want a nice hold without it looking shiny/greasy.  I could never find these 2 needs in one hair gel.  However that search is over because thanks to my local sports clips I was introduced to this reformer.

It does a good job at holding and being this is a matte black means the greasy look is gone.  I would guess I have went through 4-5 cans of this product.  Typically I will pick one up if needed while there getting a hair cut.  Amazons price is just a tad cheaper so I purchased this one from here.",1
"After used for a week, this cleanser made my skin very dry. I stopped using the product when I saw wrinkles on the forehead, cheeks and even on the nose.
I wasted my money on this absurd product.",0
This is a good as any shave cream I have tried. It is essentially odorless and the razor slides smoothly through it. It seems expensive but it's a big jar and will last me for several months.,1
I've been shaving with DE razors since the early 60's and I recently purchased the Merkur adjustable model. This is a very well made razor although expensive. It  shaves well but also very heavy and bulky. For the money I don't believe you can beat the Gillette DE adjustable model. I have since retired the Merkur and gone back to the Gillette. I gave it a four star rating because of the weight.,1
"I have very sensitive skin, prone to redness. This cleanser is one of the very few which help to keep my skin redness-free",1
"As another reviewer stated, this ""stuff"" lol, is really magic.  I have sensitive skin and along with using 5 blade razors (which are stupid expensive), I use sensitive skin shaving cream as well and have ALWAYS had a problem with getting razor burn/bumps and ingrown hairs.  With this, a dab rubbed in after a shower and shave and I'm good.  My face doesn't look irritated, and it keeps my skin feeling refreshed, not itchy and burning feeling which is how I used to feel, even after using some top quality aftershave lotions.  Nothing worked, this stuff is really gold in a bottle.  Expensive, but it really does work if you have sensitive skin.",1
"Horrible, smells really strong and leaves a thick residue. Will be returning this product",0
I couldn't get it to do anything. I didn't thinj it was working correctly...sent it back,0
"The product is like a sampler, & such high price. I tried it and you can get the same result with Over the counter $3.00 product. I don't know the comments that they said it is so great and my hair is much thicker. I think they didn't check out the products that are easy available. I spent $33.00 dollars for 2 ounces of each shampoo, conditioner & hair setting lotion and did not see the different. It is a rip off.",0
The packagine is carton insteadof metal and the scent is pure alcohol. Totally fake :( Very disallowed.,0
"My review is not for the Mia 2 but for the Clarisonic line the Clarisonic Plus.  Received this higher end model, with the extension handle and body brush, as a gift. I never dropped the unit or even used it in the shower only for facial cleansing. ONE day it stopped holding a charge. I was able to recharge it and afterward it no longer oscillated only hummed.  Called Clarisonic, offered to send pics and all that they offered was a 25% off coupon for a replacement.  Unit is in pristine condition!  Terrible customer service. Have to admit it worked until it didn't. Consider another brand. Obviously these units are not built to last.",0
"Smells Fantastic, but doesn't work any better than a $5 antiperspirant you can buy anywhere else. I've decided to stick with the one of the store bought clinical strength ones for about $8.",0
"I bought this product mainly because my daughter has fair, sensitive skin, which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation. This product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face, hands etc. It did not irritate her skin at all...the problem, the one and only problem, is the fragrance, if you can call it that. It stinks so bad, I did not want to go near her after I wiped her down...I had to give her a bath, it was so bad.",0
I really wanted to like this product because i have used the re texturizing body pads in the past on my face and body and i loved it!  These broke me out really bad so now i have scarring and tiny red bumps and pimples popping up everywhere. I will be going back to the other cane + austin pads.,0
Excellent,1
This is an amazing product. I love using it on my children. It doesn't leave their hair feeling dry and brittle. A little bit goes a long way.,1
"It's OK, but there is not much in it.  Was dissapointed in the amount that was in it.  Buy at your own risk.",1
"received wrong product,unable to sent back",0
This is 125W and not universal. This information was not provided on the site. Kindly always provide this so customers are aware of its power consumption.,0
"Gave as a gift for my sister who loves OPI, the polish stained her nails. Havent had any other issues with this brand.",0
Makes my skin feel silky smooth.  Didn't clog my pores either,1
Doesn't heat up properly.,0
Totally different smell then the real Chrome. Smells like it was mixed with something else and almost like it was watered down. Guess I will need to buy it locally.,0
"I have thick, corse, super curly hair and this is the best flat iron I have ever used. Although I don't use it on a weekly basis I do use it pretty frequently and my last one lasted 5 years until one side of it stopped heating up. Definitely worth my $30 investment! Looking forward to getting another one to last the next 5 years.",1
It's a hit or miss with me but this didn't help my skin :(,0
"Great value and the spray is lovely, but it carries a heavy scent, so you should know that before buying.  If you wear other scented items, this may clash.  The scent eventually seemed to disperse but my husband who is not fond of strong scents makes a comment each time I use it.",1
This product is everything the company claims!,1
Don't like it after I spay it my face feels sticky,0
muy buenos resultado,1
I THINK I AM ALLERGIC TO IT I KNOW I AM  ALLERGIC TO FIBERS BUT THOUGHT THIS WAS REGULAR SPRAY BUT ITS NOT.,0
Best acne medication on the market.,1
good product but not exceptional and is overpriced,1
"I really like Anthelios 60 Ultra Light Sunscreen Fluid by La Roche-Posay. It comes in 30 and 60 spf. I bought it at my CVS but I think it's also available in department stores, et al. I have sensitive combo skin and this stuff is super great because it's totally non-greasy, absorbs real quickly and isn't thick at all. Plus it leaves no white mask or anything the way 60spf Coppertone and Neutrogena spf has the habit of doing. Perfect for wearing under makeup. Also, the shape of the tube is really convenient and nice. I'd suggest you to check it out.

Hope this helps!

Wonderful for extremely soft hair. Helps hold curls.,1
"The gap between the plates basically turns this tool into a nightmare, pulling out your hair. It feels like pulling a piece of tape out of your hair with every stroke. If there were no gap, this iron would be phenomenal, but its just ruined in this way.",0
"I wanted to love this!  As a professional hairdresser I purchased this, the flat iron nd the hair dryer.  this was so highly raved about and it just didn't live up to the hype at all!  This iron seemed to clamp the hair and pull single hairs on my clients constantly.  This entire rose gold set is gorgeous and I wanted to LOVE it so much but none of them lived up to their standards,  especially not for professional use. Very sad!",0
"Easy to use
  Love it.",1
The color is darker than expected and not creamy enough.  It could work better for a young person without as many creases under the eyes as mine.,0
"This stopped working. At first, it stopped getting hot enough. Then the indicator light stopped coming on, but would sometimes come on if the butt of the iron where the cord attached was twisted and turned just the right way....ridiculous. I wish I could have returned it. It's useless to me now and it was expensive. I bought another one in janurary 2015 and the same thing happened just now! The chord is all twisted and its turning on and off. either these are knock offs or hot tools just SUCKS.",0
This didn't work for me. Hair did not fluff up.,0
"Overall I am pleased with this product. Does not leave my skin dry like other products with Retin-A, but feels smooth and I think I look better.",1
I don't know if this was an old bottle or if it was fake but the smell is different than the bottles Ive gotten at Ulta. Id recommend buying it there.,0
Does exactly what it claims. I love this product,1
Come broken,0
This is my second Clarisonic and both stopped holding a charge after about a year. Very disappointed especially considering the price. Would not recommend.,0
"Face feel a strong tingling sensation, the whole piece is red, direct allergies",0
"This is the ""reformulated"" Pearatin Fortifying Repairative Serum.  I used the original formula for years and loved it because it was light, smelled great, and wasn't oily.  The new stuff is awful--it is thick and oily and makes my hair feel oily and gross.  It takes soap and hot water plus vigorous rubbing with a towel to even get it off my hands!  If I could give less than one star I would.  I wish Loma hadn't changed their old formula--now I have to try to find another product elsewhere.",0
"Maybe this make-up works for 16-year-old girls and models, but it was thick and caked into my lines and wrinkles.  It was also impossible to blend it.  I wrote to TCP Global Corp., and they don't do refunds on make-up unless it hasn't been used or even taken out of the box!!  How on earth would anyone know how it worked for them if they couldn't use it.  I should NOT have tried this...$50.00 in the trash.  Oh, and I would not buy from TCP Global Corp. if they were the last company on earth, and they had water, and I was thirsty, and it was cheap - I think I've made my point.",0
"I really wanted to like this lotion, but the smell kills it for me. It reminds me of the Avene body oil- a ""clean"" scent but too strong for my liking.",0
"This is the only dandruff shampoo that actually WORKS. Whenever my husband stops using it, his dandruff comes back. It's a great product! Love Davines",1
"This product is all about learning how to use it.
When I first go this, I was soooo excited about it. I mean, a mascara that promises not to smudge? Who wouldn't be excited? And with my super oily eyelids, I have struggled with mascaras many times before.

Then I got the mascara.

At first, it was awful. I mean BAD. It was clumpy and just seemed to wet my lashes. But then I learned how to apply, and it was like a dream.

You have to apply the mascara without twisting the brush at all and only applying a thin coat. Then, I go to the other eye and do the same, and then do another coat on both sets of lashes. Now, it makes my lashes look awesome and I no longer have smudges under my eyes and marks on my upper eyelids. Yay!

And it really is easy to get off, you just have to wet your face and tug gently on the lashes to make the tubes slide right off. It might take a little while to get the tube off, but it was worth it.",1
Loved it,1
"This came in my Ipsy bag and I absolutely love this product. I use very little while hair is wet (shoulder length hair) it helps the air drying process go faster (in my experience). I would highly recommend for dry hair!! I will order, hope it will be back in stock soon.",1
"Love the color, just what I needed for my bathroom, but paid quite a bit for this and its molded in less than a month! I've purchased $1 liners from walmart that have lasted at least 6-8 months before beginning to mildew on the bottom. This curtain has mildewed all over. Very disappointed.",0
Outstanding product for dry ends.,1
Pump does not work,0
"This is an OK hair blowout.  However, you spray it on the mid shaft of hair to ends, which gets tedious. I don't see any difference when I don't use it.  I have fine hair & maybe it justs works better on different hair types. I'm sure Oribe has excellent hair products, just not for me & my incorrigible hair!!",1
"This is another fun set by Vichy. First of all, as I've said in other reviews, the Micellar Water is the best cleanser I've ever used on my skin. There are lots of brands and they all seem to work well for me. My complexion is the clearest it's been in years. The kit includes a large size bottle of the Micellar Water. There are three different masks as well and they are sample size.
Double Glow Peel Mask: This is my favorite of the three masks. It has barely any scent and is light to apply. It certainly does make my skin glow as described.
Quenching Mineral Mask: This is another light mask that really gives moisture to your skin. After you use it, you're supposed to rub it in the skin. This always seems weird to me, but I know they just want the product to continue to moisturize your skin. I'm a little hesitant to leave it all on my skin, but it's a nice mask.
Pore Purifying Clay Mask: I liked this one the least, but it's not bad overall. It has a strong scent, which bothers me. The clay does help with impurities and it's easy to apply. I just prefer the other two over this one.
All and all a very nice set in a pretty colored tin box. This would be a great gift too. Recommended.",1
Great color. Wore good.,1
Very disappointing product even when you realize the size .  It doesnt stay on the hair like other products of this should and DO,0
Was great but not great enough for me to order again.,1
Waste of money,0
Don't buy this product. Save your money. It never reaches max. temp.,0
Love the product at first but then after using it 10 times it the mitt pulled away from the plastic liner....totally useless,0
Doesn't work at all.,0
"Great items, quick shipping.",1
I was disappointed with this base coat. I always dread getting glitter nail polish off so thought that this might be the perfect solution. It helped it come off so much that my entire nail color was peeling off the next day!  It is also a matte white do I do not think you could put a clear glitter top coat over it.,0
I like this eyeliner. I don't have to concern about the oil on my face. Finally I find the perfect one.,1
"Not as subtle as expected.  From the sample, I anticipated a ""blackberry cobbler meets vanilla"" scent.  I no longer wear it.",0
"I read about it in a magazine and it was reccommended(can't remember which mag. now.  It did not help my hair at all,nor would I ever recommend it to anyone.",0
"This product does not remove my makeup or cleanse my skin well. My skin is normal-dry during the winter and this has been terrible. I used more than half of the bottle, so I can say with relative certainty that it didn't do anything for me and (along with the Toleriane face lotion) caused a breakout of small red bumps. I was hoping to like this line because my skin is so reactive and sensitive, but it really isn't a great product for me.",0
"Don't know if this one was a bit off, but this foam's scent smells like soda syrup to me. My husband uses the Rituals ""Samurai Shower Gel"", and that one smells wonderful, we both agree.",0
"A bit firm but one can control it by lighter strokes ,bristles did not fall out much but I am not too sure how 'natural' the bristles were as it's clearly a China made brush .The wooden bamboo handle was discolored much ,like akin to mold and it wasn't packaged like it is a new unused brush .",0
"This moisturizer is my favorite! It's lightweight, but works at night, too. I have olive skin and live in the Pacific Northwest, where there is low humidity.",1
"It worked great, it did protect my hair color, the only thing I didn't like was that it left my hair oily as times and it weighed my hair down, while some would like that I dont, so its more on preference of how you want your hair. It arrived fast, wrong for my hair, but might be perfect for your hair.",1
"I purchased this hoping to achieve soft waves but instead, I didn't really get any type of curls. I normally use a 1 inch and it's fine but this one just sort of flick my hair outwards or inwards but not curls. Not really waves either.",0
Noticed no difference in the thickness of my hair after using an entire bottle. Was not satisfied and will not be purchasing again.,0
"After months of using it twice a day, there have been no changes.",0
It doesn't work Not good as I think,0
I LOVE this company's Eye Brow Pencil and decided to try the Lip Liner. I found a new favorite. Excellent Product.,1
It really did not help at all. Made my hair very greasy. I would not recoomend this product to anyone,0
"very pretty, subtle w nice shimmer. wish it lasted longer",1
Not true to color! Or even close! It's the same color as a concrete driveway.,0
"Streaky, but convenient.  Wouldn't purchase again.",0
"I buy this color all the time, they haven't had it in the stores the last couple of times I went so I tired of online. This product is not the same quality nor shade I get in the stores.",0
"This Stylus is pretty rad, but I've only used it once due to getting distracted by baby. When I use it some more I will update! It definitely beats a flat iron, I can say that much!!",1
"I wish the handle was a tad bit heavier.  This feels a little too light for the size.  It's a good value for someone getting into traditional shaving but I do think there are better options out there for a little more money.

Small for travel with a little weight to it.  In my opinion it's worth the extra money and a definite 5 star item.",1
I use quite a few LRP products and something is wrong with this one. It smells like diesel fuel. Sending back.,0
"Have you ever once had a blowdryer slip off your bathroom counter?  If so, absolutely do not throw $100 down the drain on this product.  One might think a blowdryer should be manufactured with the fortitude to withstand such an incident.  I'm pretty sure this isn't the only blowdryer to have taken such a tumble under my ownership.  However, it is the only one to be rendered worthless as a result.

After owning this blowdryer for less than six months, it slipped off my bathroom counter one morning.  The plastic casing housing the filter on the back shattered on impact.  I tried super gluing the pieces back together, but the filter housing didn't fit securely back onto the unit.  I figured this shouldn't be an issue.  As the filter is removable, surely I could just contact BaByliss (apparently owned by Conair) and purchase a replacement part, right?  Wrong.  They do not offer any replacement parts.

BaByliss (aka Conair) was kind enough to respond to my inquiry (which clearly stated the fact that the dryer fell off my counter) with the following email:

[i]""Dear Conair Consumer,

Thank you for contacting us regarding a part for your dryer. Unfortunately, we do not carry any replacement parts, such as the filter cover housing.  Please accept our apology for any inconvenience.

If your dryer is within the  limited warranty, we can offer you a replacement unit.  Please call our customer service department at 1-800-326-6247 for assistance with a return authorization.

They will need your name, address, phone number, model number and date of purchase when you call.  If a receipt is not available, the warranty will be determined by a 4-digit manufacturing date code, which is imprinted on the unit.

Regards,
Consumer Correspondent""[/i]

That sounds promising, no?  Not remotely, as it turns out.  I called customer service with my Amazon receipt handy.  I was advised that manufacturer defects are the only thing covered under the warranty.  WTF?  Why would they respond to my tale of my blowdryer taking a counter top tumble with any sort of glimmer of hope that my $100 investment was not lost?  I can only assume:

1.  They do not actually read the facts supplied by consumers,
2.  They entrust response to written inquiries to employees who do not know there is no such warranty, or
3.  They do not value consumer loyalty any more than they value manufacturing a product of adequate quality to withstand normal incidents of use.

If you can guarantee that you will never allow a blowdryer to slip off your bathroom counter, then by all means shell out $100 for this product.  But if there is any remote possibility that it may slip from your counter or ever slip out of your hand, know that it is not designed to withstand a couple foot fall and you can toss it in the trash as BaBYLISS DOES NOT STAND BEHIND THIS PRODUCT.

But I will give props where they're due for one thing.  In all the literally hundreds of products I have purchased off Amazon over the years, this is the first experience that left me feeling disgruntled enough to write a negative review.  Cheers to BaByliss for being my first!",0
love it,1
Chalky pencil .. Not smooth on the eye.  THE color is not a saturated tone.  .,0
I didn't like it ended up cleaning it off my arm. Also it's $42 at walmart,0
Fell apart and crumbled all over the place.,0
Love the fragrance!!!!!,1
A little too oily,0
The color is a bit darker than I anticipated but still very nice; just more neutral than I expected with two coats.,1
"Not so crazy about this one , seemed to give hair more of a crunch than a smooth curl. Have purchased less expensive brands that did a better job.",0
Love this moisturizer. I have pretty dry skin but live in a very humid climate. This moisturizer is the right amount of moisture for me without being greasy or causing breakouts. I've been using it for over a year now and have nothing but good things to say!,1
Didn't notice a difference after use.,0
"I bought my first Hot Tools curling iron 18 months ago locally. The thermostat went out in six months.  It was stuck on high and burned my hair off. Hot tools would replace it but I had to pay a five dollar fee plus shipping both ways to get a new one. Adding in some kind of mailer I could get one at Amazon (a prime member) for almost the same cost. I got one from Amazon in August of 2015. Two days before Christmas 2016,  it burned the ends of my hair off.  It was set on the medium setting as was the first iron. I really liked the curling iron but I am giving up on Hot Tools. I am giving it a one star due to it's unreliability.",0
"I love this shampoo, it leaves my hair feeling CLEAN and has a nice SHINE. I use it almost every 2-3 days and my hair never gets weighed down or oily. Must get this product!",1
I bought these on sale for like $26 and would not buy them again.,0
"Love this curling iron!! I have fine, thin hair and this curls my hair at about 330 temp. My hair keeps the curls over night, even tho I don't put any product in my hair (except for heat-protection spray). 1-1/4 size curling iron was perfect to give me loose bouncy curls (semi-long hair). I would recommend starting at the lowest temp setting and work your way up till you find when your hair starts to hold the curl. Do not go straight to the highest temp, as you might burn off your hair due to everyone having different hair types. I bought mine from the seller Quick E Shop, came brand new and authentic.",1
"The scent.....It reminds me of witch hazel......
The lowest quality of toner and very bad scent. Would not recommend it. Maybe it was the shipper.",0
"When I received the tube 3 or 4 days ago, there was no seal under the cap and it looked as if 1/2 the tube was missing.",0
I've used it for a long time.  I like it!,1
"I read most of the reviews,,,, you know what? They all are true, this product really works",1
"This goes on well. Allow enough time for  a second coat. I never have good luck with polish on my hands, so used this for a pedi. Long lasting, rich color with nice depth.",1
It is a great cream for dry skin and it works great on my sensitive skin.,1
"I had such hope for this product. It is difficult to find a charcoal gray eyeliner marker. This one dried out so quickly it took me twice as long to line my eyes. I should have sent it back, but I missed the March 23 deadline. Very disappointed.",0
"I love this stuff. The scent is fresh and unique, not overpowering. Once applied your skin stays soft all day. Definite must-have!",1
Absolutely delicious frangrance. Last a good while also. Fantastic product. 1 star removed for price but would give half star back if I could,1
Great buy,1
"Used for 4 weeks ,saw no change at all",0
elegant fragance,1
I love St. Tropez but this one is a joke. I used It faithfully and went through more than half of the container.  It just doesn't work. Go with another St Tropez product.,0
"The companys claim that it reduces the appearance of age or sunspots on hands & dcolletage is absolutely correct!
While the price is pretty high, one tube lasted me 17 months. You don't have to use very much.",1

"I bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift, and he loves it! Every time he shaves, he comments on how much he loves his new razor. The only non-positive thing he has said is that he has trouble in certain areas, like at the jawline. It's a tricky spot, especially since this razor doesn't curve along with the face. With more uses, he's gotten a lot better, and he doesn't see himself going back to his old razors.",1
Very good product. You have to use all the products together to get the best results.,1
It worked well.....but it broke on me 6 months after I bought it.,0
Great Product,1
I've been using this product once a day along with cardio and interval training 2x a week. Haven't noticed any toning of my body.,0
"Very mediocre and very overpriced. I didn't think a highlighter could look cakey until I came across this product. Not only this, but if you try to use it over foundation, it will completely displace any foundation, concealer, blush, etc that you may put it over. As a person with an issue with skin redness, I was left with cheekbones that looked like cheap red discoballs. Stays tacky and sticky right up until you take it off. I also attempted to mix it in with foundation to create an all-over dewy look, and it made no difference. Not worth the money. Try Benefit high beam or the cheap e.l.f dupe instead.",0
2nd application - still not tan.  I have fair skin,0
"I was disappointed in the amount that it held. It covered well and was easy to use, but I wish it had lasted longer.",0
"My favorite moisturizer
I use day and night
Immediately disappears into skin so you can put on makeup
Skin feels great",1
"I LOVE this conditioner! I was actually surprised by good this works. It provides a nice color and leaves my hair very soft. I'm only giving 4 stars because of the price for the amount you get. Unfortunately, I have thick, coarse hair, so I only got about 4-5 uses out of this container. If you have normal hair, it would probably last you 10 times (color is good for at least a week). It instructs you to towel dry your hair before applying it, so my hair really soaks it up. Other than that, I love it.

I also use Tressa Watercolors shampoo in copper/red (mixed) prior to using this. I've had dyed red hair (all different shades) a majority of my life but only since I started using these products did people actually start commenting on my bright hair color. Very strange, but I'm very happy!!!!

As a side note, this doesn't do much for non-dyed hair. My roots are medium-dark brown and using the combination of products has given my roots more shine and a tinge of red so the root line is less obvious, but this is really for dyed hair or natural redheads.",1
"At first it smells OK,  like a lot of other aquatics do.
Cucumber, spice and flowers, very fresh.
The drydown is a sweet soapy warmth, not at all harsh.
The  longevity is a weakness, it does definitely NOT last an eternity , at least not on on my skin .
After 3-4 hours it goes flat without character, smells like any soap or laundry detergent.
Sorry guys, I must say this  was a disappointment to me. In the price range of 20-40 USD there are much better options out there.",0
Not the real deal,0
As described,1
"Tiny little thing you'd carry for a 3 day trip, missed that when I ordered. Plus I really like ginger but not much taste to it. Cleaned ok. Will not order again.",0
"Beware if you have even slightly enlarged pores. I ended up with an instant cheekful of blackheads after just one swipe. (And that was on top of primer, foundation, and a dusting of powder.) This is a very fine, silky powder -- very blendable -- and it may be great for folks with perfect skin, but if you weren't so blessed, I'd give this a miss and go for a creme contour product instead.",0
My wife was thrilled to get this brush as a gift.  If you wife has hair she will want this brush.,1
"The #1 make-up remover, period.  I've tried many different products from many different cosmetic companies with varying results.  Many products are okay, some are good, but this one is THE BEST, absolutely.  It's very gentle on the eyes with special natural botanicals while being extremely effective in removing eye makeup, even waterproof.  And it's very economical.  A little goes a long, long way.  Look no further, this is the one.",1
"bad bad bad bad bad
it's terrible",0
"I had used this product several years ago and fell in LOVE but couldn't remember the name. I was so estatic to happen across it on Amazon because I always remembered how wonderful it smelled. The texture is wonderful and it leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. However, the scent leaves a little to be desired. The Vanilla Coconut scent is light and doesn't have a lasting effect.

I may repurchase and try some of the different scents.",1
The best and lowest  price I ever paid in AUD.Overly happy .Best service. Thank you,1
"I bought Vinylux Red Baroness and and the Weekly Top Coat and just left a review for the Red Baroness color coat. I prepped very carefully prior to my first use. Two coats of polish and Weekly Top Coat after. I had best results when I let the polish dry well prior to applying the top coat, tried not to disturb the nails for at least an hour. No washing hands, picking at things, etc. I spent several hours in direct sun after that and the result was 3 days without chipping. That's not 7 days, but for me it was amazing. Since that first application i have been a bit lazing about application. If I apply the top coat within a few minutes of the color, it partially dissolves the color near the tips in areas, giving a ghost effect. Overall, very satisfied and will definitely try more colors. I used to get CND Shellac manicures once or twice a month with great results, but can no longer afford it.",1
So easy to use.  Love it!,1
"This eyeliner came dry, doesn't give a smooth precise line. I've always bought pen eyeliner from Japan and Hong Kong, because they're the best. This didn't even come close to Dolly Wink or KissMe Heroine pen liner.",0
Not the real product.,0
I love the smell!,1
"FIrst read a lot of good reviews for this product. I like it. I am not inlove exactly, but it definitely give an extra cleaning.",1
It's the only shampoo that makes my hair happy and healthy,1
It is a light Tint.  I like the feel of the lotion.,1
cleanses so well and doesn't damage or dry out skin.  leaves face feeling good and so smooth...moisturizing... a great product.,1
"It is okay but I believe that its fake. Although this is my first Wen product ever, that container nor the product met my expectations. The container looked used as well when I first got it. Never buying it again",0
I received a diferent color something turqoise...not even close with the color I orderd.,0
"As with all beauty products, this is relative. I just didn't like it for my skin. I found myself breaking out a bit and I am not sure what combination of factors caused this but it was while using this product.",0
heaven smell! yuuuuum,1
It's was not worth the hype,0
not for me. break me out so bad!!!!,0
"Love this cream! I am sold really helps w/. dry skin. I am so glad to have found the less expensive cream that is exactly the same thing as the more expensive one. Thank you, Reviewer who wrote about that!!! The light menthol smell dissipates very quickly but the skin feels awesome all day! Highly recommend.",1
Dried My Hair out. I would go with WEN instead. I had already tried WEN but was trying a cheaper alternative. I have curly loose wave hair.,0
I love this cream and a great smell will order again,1
Be very careful. I buy Hot Tools faithfully. This iron when I heated it up on medium heat the tip began melting to the iron. Unfortunately I didn't realize this & put a section of hair in to begin a curl. Immediate sizzle & hair burnt off. I think this iron is defective.  I've never had this issue with any Hot Tools irons. I'm returning this iron even though I'll have to dig the boxes out of the trash.,0
"Um, wow! This is the best makeup purchase I have made online ever.  It arrived on time in good condition, and it is the same color palette in person as it looks like it is online! Also, I applied two of the colors of the triple cognac combo I purchased to my eyes the night I got it, but before I took my shower and I forgot to remove it. Unlike my other natural mineral based eye shadows this did not come off in the shower and it stayed on for the next day because I didn't remove it since it looked very nice in a subtle shadowed way over my eyes.  This is the best, most natural and subtle color palette I have found in the natural products and I am so happily surprised!  I almost didn't buy this because of the price and I've been burned before with trying to purchase certain colors from online only to have them arrive a very different looking color in person, and maybe it's just that my screen is calibrated to show these colors accurately, but this really was spot on. I have fair skin and eyes that are not sunken in at all but more protruding out, so any color shows up quite strongly on my eyelids and I am so thrilled to have found this for the days I need to look classy, subtle, natural, etc.",1
very helpful with cleaning your face.,1
"Love it!!  Have worn Calvin Klein Obsession for years, but think I may have found a new favorite!",1
Usually don't use a base coat (I know I know!) but I like this one.,1
Good body and hair wash to put in your toiletrie bag and use on vacation.,1
Nothing tops this lip balm. Has an amazing lime mojito smell and works wonders on chapped lips. Instantly your lips are smooth and conditioned. Best I've ever used and nothing ever worked for me before. This is the Queen of chapstick.,1
Got shipped and deleivered fast even in this busy holiday season good job and good product,1
Does not sharpen very well. Breaks off a lot. Otherwise I love this eye liner!!!,1
"Very thin pads, too less wet from nail polish remover...not working for more than 5 nails.
In comparison with those pads made by Johnson & Johnson: no quality ..not that what was promissed.
I could not find the product of Johnson: maybe not available anymore?",0
This seems like it is drying my hair in half the time and my hair looks and feels healthier.  I think it's a good buy for a very good hair dryer.,1
"2nd time ordering.  The first bottle lasted 2 weeks.  The second bottle last 1 week.  When I get this product from my usual spa, it last for almost 2 months.  Will not order again.  Cant tell if the packaging is the original packaging.  Buyer beware.",0
"Does not hold hair in position at all and I do not like the ""floor cleaner"" scent.  Overall, I am very disappointed",0
"I loved the color, but the polish did not stay on. I was very disappointed in that fact because it was
a really great color. After one day, the polish was coming off.",0
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister who loves makeup. And boy am I pleased with my purchase. First off, I love the brand, theBalm. Their branding is so fun and creative it's hard not to like. Secondly, these are all matte shadows in both cool and warm neutral tones. This palette also contains a mirror which adds to the value. Although it is a somewhat big palette in length and width, it doesn't seem bulky because of how thin it profiles.

It fits perfectly stacked in her makeup bag with a few of her other palettes and the rest of her makeup.",1
"The product is good, I've been using it for years already.",1
"Very Hydrating, not greasy at all, feels very good on my face, not too heavy feeling on my skin at all",1
love it but pricie,1
"Since this is labeled a texture and volume spray, I was expecting something that would add pieceyness and separation to my style.  This is more like a dry shampoo.  It does add some volume, but it doesn't last, and did not provide the hold advertised, either.  I found the scent quite unpleasant as well.  An expensive product for the size, and not worth the price, IMO.",0
"I gave the candle for my wife to try and asked what she thought.  Here's her review:

This candle is very pretty is an understated way.  It is almost pure white in a nice simple glass jar.  At one point I thought someone had left a glass of milk sitting on the table!

The fragrance is VERY light which could be good or bad. If you have someone with allergies, it will probably not bother them.  My husband claims he cannot even smell it.  I notice the scent as I enter the room where it is burning but quickly I lose the scent.  So if you are looking for a very highly scented/fragrant candle, this is not for you, but if you want a very light aroma, then this is your candle.

I have not yet burned it completely down so I cannot say what it will be like at the very end.  You do have to be sure to trim the wick as it is smoky when extinguished if you are not careful.",1
"My friend raves about strivectin and I've tried it in the past and liked it but it was quite expensive and for one reason or another I stopped using it. I got this kit to test the products out before buying the full size versions. If you want to see if this product agrees with your skin, get this kit.
The samples are not travel sized, they are sample sized. Very small. They've lasted me 4 am/pm uses. That's not ebough to test for results so just be ware of that fact before buying. Amazon does sell a similar kit for $79 with 1 ounce bottles which would be a good kit to test for results. Any who, I am buying the full size versions now.",1
"I terribly miss the old Poetic Waxing kit that came in a metal mug. Yes, it took longer to warm on the stove. Yes, I needed a dedicated saucepan that I used only to warm my wax, since wax got on the saucepan and was hard/impossible to clean. HOWEVER, I feel the microwave kit takes extra time too, and takes more attention/effort in the warming period, and results in waste of wax, and, as others have mentioned is smaller so is even MORE expensive per use than the original, which is sort of amazing given how much these have always cost.

In the microwave cup, the wax melts inconsistently and so I need to microwave, try to stir half-melted-half-hard wax, again microwave, again try to stir half-melted-half-hard wax, repeat six or seven times total. Also, I DISLIKE microwaving plastic. Yes, all sorts of industries tell us that microwaving plastic is safe. Girl, please.

But my main beef with the microwave kit is that in the actual process of waxing, as I dip the applicator into the wax and the scrape the excess off before applying it to my hairy person, most of the wax transfers to the inside walls of the microwave cup and hardens there. So that the next time I get out the wax kit, I have somehow scrape or chip the wax off the sides and into the bottom. I find that I can't get it all off, and it doesn't melt down, and so that's wax that gets wasted. And yes, as other comments have mentioned, the whole kit seems smaller and even MORE expensive. Every time I've used the microwave version of the kit, I felt insulted. It's poor design, and for the high price, I expect better.

One thing that remains excellent about the kit: the wax itself. It takes hair off. I've tried the inexpensive Parissa kit, and the wax in that kit is very ineffective compared to the Bliss wax.

(On a related note, there's a vendor here on Amazon who sells dead stock of the original waxing kit. I don't recommend that you buy one of those. They are six years old and for some reason, the wax doesn't perform like the Poetic wax we love. Perhaps this is due to the age of the kits, or perhaps the kits are defective, which is how the seller got a hold of the kits in the first place.)

Here's the silver lining! By brutally discontinuing my favorite waxing kit that I faithfully bought for years, Bliss has ultimately done me a favor. I'm now setting out to recreate the Original Poetic Waxing Kit experience on my own. I'm going to buy a wide, deep, and inexpensive enamel cup. I already have a set of 100 Gigi wooden applicators (way cheap here on Amazon, and in a wider range of useful sizes than is provided in the Bliss kit). And I WILL find a nice blue wax that performs as well as the Poetic Waxing wax. I'm going to try Starpil blue wax cubes (also available here on Amazon). If I can get it to work well, I will save so much money.

Hmph. So there.",0
This eye cream is awesome for my sensitive skin!  Love that it has an SPF.  Use it every morning.  Highly recommend.,1
Not as expected,0
"was order by mistake , was wanting obsession cologne",0
"I love Stila products, but this eyebrow color didn't work for me.  I exchanged the first one I received because I could not get any color to come out of the wand; it appeared to be completely dry.  The second one did the same thing, so don't know what I am doing wrong.  For me, it was a toss away.",0
"I like that it directly targets the pores instead of just the overall facial area. To me, if it targets an area, it's formulated better to actually help instead of just trying to be a Jack of All Trades, Master of None. It goes on smoothly and ""feels"" like it's working (if you use masks, you know what that means haha).

I received a sample from PINCHme for free in exchange for review.",1
This is a fake. Bought the real item from my hairdresser after I paid to have my highlights redone because this shampoo stripped my hair. Showed the product to my stylist and she confirmed it is fake or has been tampered with. I have a prime membership and have enjoyed Amazon immensely until this past year. I do not have any suggestions for Amazon to deal with and stop this type of fraud. Feel like I lost a good friend.,0
"This hair gel is great - works wonderfully for my curly hair, and I've purchased it in stores with great results.  However, the packaging for this item appears to be an issue, as I've now ordered this product twice and both times the pump part has arrived broken and leaking gel everywhere.  The first time I figured it was a fluke, but now it's happened twice.",0
"Not sure what to make of this product.  Has the looks, texture and outward appearance of a good, brush applied cream but unless there is an instruction manual with application particulars I'm not aware of, can't seem to get it to work.  Ultimately, it spreads rather than lather so you need rather copious amounts.  Have tried applying by hand, to dry face, to wet face, from wet brush, from dry brush and from cup, all to no avail.  Very disappointing.  I've been a badger brush user for close to 2 decades and have used a wide variety of creams including Art of Shaving, Kiehls, Taylor of OBS and Truefitt.  All of which far surpass Baxter of California.  Well maybe not ALL and FAR but generally.  Once you do end up getting it on and spread, no matter how thick or thin, the results are spotty at best.  Also trialed with safety razor and Gillette Fusion to no better results than those predicted.",0
DISAPPOINTING- PREFER THE ORIGINAL MINT,0
It says you are not suppose to shake it. I used it twice a day and it made my face too dry. I stopped using it this often and I don't see any improvements. I won't be buying it again. And it ran out too quickly. It has alcohol and burns my nose when I am applying it.,0
Very beautiful nail polish. Stockholm Syndrome is a dark grayish color that looks thick and shiny on my nails. Arrived on time and wrapped very well and protected. Very happy.,1
This fragrance doesn't last long at all. Purchased a small version from Dillard's and the scent last all day. The one I purchased from here seems watered down,0
I've been using this for the past 4 days (both in the evenings and mornings) and every time it has made my skin looks redder with a slight burning feel.  I've decided to stop using it.,0
Worth it! It's not a magic wand to transform fried hair to silk but it makes the hair so much more manageable. I used once and my hair is much softer and get tangled much much less! It's just better than any other hair treatment I have ever used before. The whole kit will last at least a year even with once weekly use!! If you color or bleach your hair regularly definitely just buy it. You will see the difference!,1
"I love this kit, which I have bought from other stores before.  It lasts me several months with daily use and helps clear up my skin from minor acne.  I work in a kitchen, so my skin gets pretty icky by the end of the day.  When I use this exclusively I don't break out.  The moisturizer is fairly heavy and thick, but I have very dry skin so I like that.

My biggest concern is that I've tried to purchase this kit from Beauty.com, but they've canceled my order three times.  I'm not sure if they're out of stock or what.",1
"Wow! What a great purchase! Very strong brush, angled precisely for all the hard to reach spots. brush is so whisper soft yet firm! Excellent concealer brush that is worth the price paid!",1
Burns my eyes,0
Doesn't smell like verbena not even in the plastic container---low sudsing.,0
I like this product it lathers up to a great puck no razor burn yet,1
"Bought for my son, he loved it.",1
Do Not Buy...I think this is a knock off.  Very disappointed!,0
Decent product. But you can get a generic facial scrub that does the same thing at wall mart for 1/5 the price.,0
When I first got the product my reaction was why is there only a sticker on top of the box containing this and not the bottom. Since I bought two product from juice beauty and they are both sealed only on top I was led to believe either they just package it like that or they are used. Once I open it up I am deeply concerned that I was sent a used product since there are stains and prints all over the container. The funny thing is I cant actually open it up because it has a weird button pressing cap inside that squeeze out bits of the moisturizer as you press it. It is completely unnecessary. I feel ripped off,0
I have thin hair. I've used many conditioners but I come back to this one. It's the best for me.,1
I read the reviews and thought I'd give it a try..well I shouldn't of done that!! Smells horrible and makes me nauseas!!,0
Great feeling.  Leaves skin feeling great.,1
Bought this product and it was verified by The Balm that it's fake. I got a huge rash on my face from using it one time :/,0
"This is a sizeable brush.  I saw the measurements, but was still surprised by how substantial it was.  Despite this, if you needed just one brush for powders, this could be it.  The quality and denseness of the brush put it in the 'just right' area for just about anything from application to smoothing, etc, just adjust the angle of attack.  Also, the simply designed handle actually made this very easy to use/steer.  Would I put this up against an offering from Hakuhodo, (personal favorite) or MAC?  Not quite, but this is probably the best offering at this price point, and certainly a better value.",1
"I used this years ago, so this purchase was truly a reorder. I likedit then, I like it now. It is pricey.",1
"a little too expensive for a toothpaste, but overall great packaging and tastes great!",1
Creamy & soothing to the scalp.  My hair gradually stopped falling out over the course of a few weeks.  The key is to let it soak for five minutes before rinsing.  I think the ana - phase of hair growth being reintroduced really does help.,1
"Let me be clear up front. I have no issue with the Amazon merchant who sold me this product. The order was packed and shipped just fine.

I have been a happy user of Art of Shaving products for many years. My experience with this product has changed my opinion of Art of Shaving. Their customer service is lackluster at best.

As other people have stated in their reviews, the packaging is very frustrating. The pump is unable to get the last 3/4 inch of product out of the bottle. Considering the bottle is about 2 1/2 inches tall this is an unacceptable amount of product to be unusable.

I decided to reach out to The Art of Shaving through their website contact form. I explained how maybe the bottle/pump that they were using wasn't up to the task. In the response, I was assured that ""We have many checkpoints along our manufacturing lines to ensure the quality of both our products and packaging, so this should not have happened.  Please be assured I'm sharing your report with the rest of our team.""

Great! However, this seems to be a common issue. Maybe I'm the first to bring it to their attention.

Then on to the snarky part:
I was told that ""It's virtually impossible to use all of the product in the pump bottle so it is normal for some of the product to be left in the bottom of the bottle.""
You're absolutely right sir. I'm not five years old so I know this. Thank you for reminding me. However, 1/3 of the bottle is more than what should be considered acceptable.

It gets better. He goes on to say ""The amount of product printed on the package is the actual amount available for use. ""
Really??? Sorry, but I don't believe this at all.

At the end of the email he offers me a gift card to compensate me for my troubles.

This is great! I thought that it was a nice gesture and it made me feel better about throwing out all that product. As a result of this gesture I let the peculiar part of the email slide. He said allow 2-3 weeks for delivery.
Okay great, Thank you!

After 4 weeks I didn't receive anything in the mail so I sent a follow up email and didn't get a response.
Four days later I sent a new contact request through their website explaining the situation. I got no response so I decided to call.

The person who answered said that the card was sent out and I should have received it by now. When I said I hadn't received it he  said he would look into it and get back to me.
After 3 days with no response I decided to follow up by calling. The person on the phone said that he had no way of looking into it and to call Citibank who issues the cards. He assured me that there was nothing he could do to look into it.

That's okay, forget about the gift card. I'm tired of dealing with it.
It's unfortunate that they don't care that I didn't receive a gift card that was supposed to make my bad experience better.
They took a potential win and turned it into a major lose.

Time to look for new shaving products because I will not be buying anything else from Art of Shaving!",0
As expected.,1
"So far this sunscreen is awesome. Not greasy, goes on clear so you don't get that white pasty sunblock face.",1
good product thank you,1
I have used other lash serums and of all of them I saw the least result with this one.  I used every night for 30 days and didn't feel as though the appearance of fullness or length of my lashes budged at all.  I used the bottom of a tube of Rodan & Fields lash serum for three days and could see results even with the last few drops I had.  It's more expensive but I get a discount and I've already ordered more.,0
"This cannot be the real product. I have gotten a bottle of this before at Macy's and loved it. The product I first bought worked great, nice dark looking tan that lasted at least 5 days. This one is very watery and although it looks nice at first as soon as I bathed it ALL came off, and I did wait longer than the alloted time before I got wet.",0
"This is a good powder for filling in your eyebrows. It lasts fairly well, but I usually need a touch up at the end of my work day if I'm going somewhere else after. Great color!",1
Loved it all. Lip gloss was a great color for fall. The eyeliner was great for my upper lid. The polishes are pretty (the red is AHHHMAZING!) and the whitish pink was just ok. Glitter was just like any other glitter polish. Overall happy with this set.,1
The best for mineral sunscreen. Kept my skin from getting blotchy on a week long trip to Hawaii.,1
"It felt like I was shaving with a toy.  Maybe great for beginners or people with thin hair, but it took forever to get a close shave, and even then, there were stubby spots.  I shave my head and face, and I have used a competitor product (EJ) with great results for many years until the top cap broke, so I decided to try this manufacturer.  The results were sub-par in my opinion, and I cannot see myself using this razor ever again.  I am sure that Merkur makes a razor that I would endorse, but this one is not it.",0
smells amazing and that is about it,0
"I am a cosmetic and bath junkie, but also care about what ingredients are in my products.  I was concerned that Petrolatum is the 2nd ingredient listed.  I googled Petrolatum and what I read, confirmed my fears.

I just wish they'd not use Petrolatum as the 2nd ingredient after sugar :(",0
"Its great I use a lot of Korres products,I was introduced to Korres by my Greek girlfriend and have used it for years",1
Gives my lips a dunkissed look. Moisturizing,1
A good way to top up your sunscreen over make up.  Has a nice finish too.,1
"Great power and dries hair quickly,  I have curly hair and the diffuser is one of the best I ever used.",1
"I am not crazy about the color at all.  No matter how much time I take putting it on, it doesn't even look like there's mascara on my lashes.  I had hoped this would be a ""lighter"" look than the black and brown that I usually wear, and it's light all right, so light I can't tell it's there.  Will give this to my niece to play with.",0
Not impressed. Its no better than plain soap.,0
"I bought this after getting one of those paper scents in a magazine.  It actally smells WAY better from the bottle, and the paper sample was wonderful.  It's light and floral, powdery...  it LASTS!!!  Not overpowering at all.

HINT:  When the Women's Aqua and Men's Aqua merge it is AMAZING!!!!",1
"The product is great but the container has changed and it is quite problematic! The product would not come out, I had to take it apart and now it won't work.",1
"Only ok, the color is not true and it is very difficult to apply.",0
"Great mascara! Definitely is clumpy at first but it's a matter of how you apply it and how much is on the brush. Takes ALOT to get it off though, which is why I deducted a star.",1
Smells good but doesn't last long,1
"This hairdryer was bought for an upcoming trip to Europe. After looking at the picture ,I assumed it came with the concentrator nozzle. It arrived without a nozzle even though the box said it was included. The company was very long in getting back to me and I had to go through Amazon the resolve the return. I am also out the amount it cost me to return ship this hairdryer. They wanted to charge me a restocking fee as well for their mistake!! I would never use this seller again!!!!",0
"I naturally have really oily hair, so the second day I go without washing my hair is really flat, and my bangs and layers don't sit as well or have the ""feathered"" look I have on the day I originally wash it. This product took away the oily look inmediately, and added a bit of volume back to my hair, too. I give it 4 stars because it didn't quite give me the volume on my entire scalp that I was hoping for. It adds it to the rest of my hair, but on my part, it still looks flat. I'm going to try other products, but I'll definitely keep this one in mind to go back to!",1
"Love, love, love the way this smells. I cant believe how inexpensive this was compared to some of the cologne I have purchased for my boys and my husband.  I think this one is a keeper.",1
"I don't think this is a particularly effective product. I tried using it on those deep under the skin pimples, and the ones at the surface, and it did not make any sort of difference. I find that tea tree oil is much more effective. However, this does go quite nicely under makeup.",0
didnt fit,0
"Went to return on amazon , they said you cannot return perfumes..really even when some nozzle gets defective...i have just used 1/8th from the bottle....what i do i do with the rest when the nozzle sprays a tiny stream at you..",0
"I am very unhappy with this eyeliner... it doesn't last on me at all, as soon as I put it on it seems to start wearing off which is rare for me and it irritates my eyes.. the color was more like a dusty plum. Maybe this works for others, but it's not for me. I tried to return with no success. I would NOT recommend this product or dealing with this Seller!! :-(",0
definitely not tangle free.  the brush part is hard and hair will not come out of it. nearly had to cut hair out.,0
The barrel on the curling wand was too thick for my LOB haircut.,0
"I was really excited to try this palette -- it's hard to find a good matte eyedhadow.

Unfortunately this purchase was very disappointing for a few reasons;

First, the colour doesn't apply evenly. You end up with a blotched look which is difficult to fix. I tried a few techniques, but between smudge brushes, primers (and absence of) I just gave up.

Second, the palette is very cakey and will leave powder everywhere. Soon as you touch it with your brush you end up with a large amount of dust. Very messy to deal with.

Had high hopes considering the other reviews but if you're looking for a solid, consistent shadow look elsewhere.",0
"this is a hand lotion. Not a cream.
Wont work as half of original shear butter hand cream.

Only pros are it smells good and pump type.",0
the bottom was broke,0
i had an  reaction to this shampoo and conditioner ended up in ER had to have two CAT scans ran and several other test!!  It is not sulfite free!!!,0
"I tried this shampoo and conditioner and it was the worst product I have ever used. It made my hair flyaway, dry and full of static even after a few days. I couldn't return it to the store I bought it from as I bought it in a different city from where I live. I called Abba and asked if they would exchange it for me if I returned it to them and they wouldn't do it. They suck. Don't buy this product!",0
The instructions are unclear concerning the order of application.  The products made my skin red and they are still stinging and hour after I applied them.  My under eye area looks worse rather than better after application.  I will never buy a skyn product again.,0
"Love the color, but it had a lot of lint in it as I applied it. I have no pets in my home and my home is very clean. I think it was used and it was advertised new. Will buy polishes at local stores now instead of online. And it was also like tar. Think it was old as well.",0
"Way too strong... diluting I suppose corrects that, but not for me. :-(",0
"Somehow it's fragrance reminds me of perfume brand cobra which is very cheap selling brand and doesn't smell good at all,not buying again :(",0
"I have had 4 professional keratin treatments and felt confident in following these instructions correctly.  It took approximately 3 hours from start to finish to complete all the steps.  After rinsing product and applying the conditioner and blow dry, my hair was pretty much EXACTLY the same.  I have wavey, frizzy and thick hair ~ not too curly.  The waves are still there as well as the frizz.  So back to the flat iron for me until I get to my hairdresser for the professional treatment.  Let them do the work.  It is a lot of work no matter how you get it done.",0
"The purple bar smells so sweet and delicate. I would definitely suggest smelling them all in person before buying since they are light scents. Also, because of this, they don't stay on your person for too long but even for the bit it does, it smells very nice. Also doesn't last too long but I think it lasted just enough for the price.",1
"To whom it may concern: Let it be known that I have used this product before but this last shipment is not worth it. The quality is inferior to the one of the previous order. The foam feels like water and  my hair does not look the same. I don't know if it is a defective batch, or if the company changed the formula. One thing I know is that  I am not satisfied. Hope that the manufacturer pay attention to the complaint and do something to  improve the quality to the level it was before. For now , I am going to try Bossley products.",0
"smells fresh, not over powering at all.",1
"Molton Brown has a distinguished and fabulous (if heavy) aroma. But this stuff contains more artificial ingredients than a Dow Chemical plant, including at least one known carcinogen. I wouldn't use this stuff to deodorize my toilet...Oh wait, I did.",0
Very thin.  More like a parfum than a body cream or moisturizer.,0
Mosturizing,1
this bronzer and matte translucent powder duo was a huge dissapointment. i heard about this product from a friend and she said that she liked the bronzer because it is sheer and she has pale skin. i ordered it and when i got it i swatched it on my arm and the bronzer is basically invisible. i don't know if it is just me but i rubbed and rubbed my brush on that bronzer and it looked like i put nothing on. the only thing i like about this product is the powder.,0
I bought this to help with wrinkles on my neck and chest as well as redness on my chest. While it hasn't helped the red skin tone it has made a noticeable difference in the wrinkles on my neck!,1
"Cleans well and removes makeup very well, smells a little , and leaves face a little ""tight"" feeling.
I don't know yet if I will stick with it after initial purchase, it is a little pricey.
Time will tell, but good as a makeup remover, but I wouldn't use it as my morning cleanse.",1
This stuff works great and smells great! It was recommended to me by my hairdresser and Im happy to see that I get way less hair in my brush every time I use it. I use it mostly with the detangling comb.,1
My wife loves this stuff.,1
the only lime here is the color of the stripe.,0
"Product is great, can be bought else where for less",0
What I got was not what was pictured and not what I expected at all.,0
Good item.  I love how it smells and makes your scalp tingle when shampooing with it.  I would order again.,1
"Finally. I haven't been able to paint my nails in 20 years because my cuticles are always dry and jagged, no matter what I try. I have never had a hand cream that actually helped long term. I borrowed a tube of this from my mother and fell in instant love. It has completely changed the look of my cuticles and my hands don't itch anymore. My only problem is that I wish it came in a huge bottle. It's worth the price, but I'd like a larger size option too. Best lotion ever for bad cuticles.",1
"I like that this products serves to help people with blemishes and hyperpigmentation. I bought it because I was hoping it would help cover up my acne scarring better than other foundations I was previously using. It was easy to apply and covered my face well. Perhaps I was putting on too much though because it felt heavy. My face did not feel matte enough and so it felt ""cakey"" afterwards even with the translucent setting powder.",0
I love this product. It's light weight and doesn't add a sticky feeling like some other products do.,1
Makes my curls behave!,1
love it,1
This is not the original formula that I received when I had signed up for the monthly program.  I really loved that formula. beware..,1
"Product is HORRIBLE. The fibers most likely could work on the back of your head as long as you have enough hair covering the scalp. My thinning is in the front and it was VERY visible - the fibers looked like blotchy dark spots. The directions said to apply liberally, then pat. NOPE. I then tried to sprinkle lightly and not pat as directed by a friend. NOPE. I tried with product, without product, with hair spray, without hair spray. NOPE. Not the mention, the fibers went EVERY WHERE, created a huge mess, and if you touch it, it comes right off and since I got dark brown I just looked filthy where it touched. I had to use a damp cloth to wipe it off of my forehead. Ma",0
it did not work they way I needed the cream to work but I still kept it and used it for my neck believe it or not it did a far job on my neck then on my face,0
"I LOVE this product, but the pump on the bottle was not working right out of the package.  I bought this as a replacement and sadly will be returning it before getting to use it.  Other than that, great product!",0
Beautiful color and great finish,1
"Minimum scent, greasy oil (castor and olive oil mainly), didn't feel any main difference between using and not using it. I won't buy again, it's just a waste of money.",0
Wax worked great.  The cup and directions made it easy to use and the hard wax is SO much better than the old strips.  Wish it weren't so $$ but this kit was worth it.,1
"This is my second opi crystal file. The only negative is it is glass and, while it doesn't easily break, did when I dropped it on my marble flooring! It is the best file and lasts forever (unless you drop it).",1
Smells wayered down. Not the authentic eternity.,0
"Great shaving cream and leaves your face feeling tingly and fresh, I would buy again but I'm currently using the soap from the same company!",1
"I discovered this cream though my dermatologist.  It's very healing. Works fast. The tube I got had a different package than the one I purchased from the doctor, and didn't seem to heal as well as the product I got at his office.",1
I use revision produts regularly and really like. I was not satisfied with this particular product though. It goes on very dry and one pump hardly covers half your face. I think i like liquid vit c better as i have used that for years.,0
I love this product and the fact that I have found a quick and easy way to get Obagi Moisturizer.,1
"Greasy, doesn't hold well, smells bad and makes my short non curly hair curl immediately after I put it in. Terrible.",0
BAD ONE! no color! and it leaves my face look full of oil!,0
A couple years ago I ordered this product and it worked great but I feel like it was in a white container with green letter. The packaging is not the same and the strength is not the same either. I paid 20 some dollars and it does nothing !! The pads are not soaked so you pull one out they are really very thin and they are mostly dry. Not even close to what I had before .,0
"I love how light the product is and how it doesn't dry out my skin, but I did notice red bumps after I used it for a week. I don't know if it is because of my cleansers or not, but those red bumps disappears after awhile.",1
"this oneburned my face ,but it also said not to use it on dark skin so.... there you go.",0
not effective at all sad to say I always loved Ahava products this one is a disapointment,0
"Dries out pimples really well. Helps them come to a head if they have not yet. I like that I can truly spot treat because since my face is dry from all the acne products I don't to apply spot treatment anywhere but where I need it. With creams although I try to spot treat it ends up being a larger area than the bump site. I am very happy with it. Will continue to use it. I don't know that it works any better than when I use the Proactiv sulfur mask as a spot treatment. I will put a dab of that on a pimple before bed and it dries it out pretty good the next day. And it is much cheaper since it comes ""free"" with the proactiv 3 piece kit. But even so I bought this and I like it and still would buy it again.",1
"BE AWARE, THIS IS A MINITURE SIZE. AND THE SELELR DOES NOT TAKE RETURNS",0
The tint made my skin look yellowish.  I ordered tan and thought it would be more of a tan color.  Sorry I won't order it again.,0
Don't buy from Harper's Choice. The babybliss flat iron is a fake. I bought it as a gift for one of my sisters so she can stop using mine. Compared it to my authentic babybliss and it's very cheap in material and performance. My other sister has a babybliss too and she tested it as well. We both agreeded that the babybliss I bought from Amazon - Harpers choice is crap. I already returned. But if you do buy authentic babybliss flat iron it's one of the best ;),0
Different product on the inside of the bottle.  Very disappointed.,0
"I quite liked the product. It gets very hot and promotes beautiful curls. The only point I did not like is the system of tweezers, because it left my hair a bit marked.",1
"I use Big Sexy Hair shampoo all the time. The product I received in the mail was fake. The bottle *looked* real, but then the shampoo in the bottle was pink and smelled perfume-y. It was not the real thing. Boo.",0
Very convenient.easy to use on the trip,1
The polish is okay but the brush separated from the cap the second time I opened it.  Now the black cap twists off and I have to use an instrument or pliers to remove the brush from the polish.,0
"With just a tad bit of scrubbing, my makeup comes off. I was super skeptical when I bought it because I was concerned it was some kind of ruse, but I got it, tested it, and it works well with my drugstore makeup, all non-waterproof. I've heard that some people have issues with non-waterproof makeup though. I would definitely recommend it for the people that decide to wear makeup every once in a while and find that makeup wipes either 1) are too expensive or 2) dry out too quickly.",1
Not the actual product inside. Came out completely different texture and color. I have been using elta md for years and bought the actual one from my plastic surgeons office. I compared them  totally different. Contacted seller. They never got back to me,0
"I'd forgot to get the Nicki Minaj collection early and was truly upset when I couldn't find them in stores. I must say, I was very hesitant about ordering polish on-line from an unknown to me company. Due to rumors of OPI knock offs. BUT... I'm very happy I tried them!!! All features indicate an authentic OPI polish. Plus I got my polish on time, nicely packaged in bubble wrap, safe and secure. It wasn't over priced which I loved too. If I make the mistake of not getting a limited edition color in time again I DEFINITELY would check with this company first.",1
"I was very excited to get this, but was so disappointed when I got a counterfeit product! It feathers immediately when put on the skin (I have NEVER had an eyeliner do that, not even the cheap ones!), even when testing on the wrist, it is not even remotely waterproof, it smudges IMMEDIATELY without even a little pressure, and it is very watery. I am not putting this anywhere NEAR my eyes, as there is NO WAY that this could possibly be the real thing.",0
"This stuff smells amazeballs.  When I skip using it for a while, my hair gets super dry and looks awful.  That said, I knocked one star off because I think you should buy from a salon instead of Amazon.  I have done both and the salon formula smells different (better!) and is thicker, which tells me the Amazon version (at least from this seller) is a knock-off rather than the real thing.  Or it's watered down or something.  Good product, just make sure you get the real thing.",1
The best,1
"This product caused an allergic reaction.  After applying, it turned my face a dark red (which lasted about 30 minutes) and I experienced a burning sensation which also lasted for about the same length of time.  Also, there is no option to choose to return this product.",0
Strong and smells a bit fake.  I've got plenty of roses in my garden and they don't smell like this.  Maybe over time the scent fades a bit so I'll have to try again.,0
"Felt sticky, made my hair tangle and really didn't hold my curl either.",0
"I have started using cream blusher - believe it works better for the more 'mature' lady . Great product , stays on all day & a soft but natural color . Very flattering product , I will continue to buy .",1
Doesn't spray evenly - creates a very stark 'spot' on your head. Shaking the regular can over the head works better.,0
"I was running out of my previous face primer and decided to give this one a try. I like it, but don't love it and here is why.

Pros
- Easy application
- Smooth finish
- Good amount of product for the money

Cons
- Doesn't even out my skin tone as much as previous primer
- Doesn't seem to last quite all day, I can make it 4-6 hours but nothing over that",1
"I watched a couple of videos on the website so I understood the directions. I was a little intimidated at first,  but once you catch on, blown away by results! My fine bottle blonde hair looks so Good! So much easier than I thought!",1
Why would they ruin this product with the dreaded dimethicone. So many good ingredients gone to waste.,0
"This lotion is awesome for problem skin, but I don't recommend using it more than once every other day. It's very thick.",1
"I had high expectations for this concealer given the great reviews and high price tag. I ordered light but realized that was not light enough - this has a bit of pinkish/brown tones and is a bit heavy for my pale complexion with red undertones. I did find even with the color difference, it blended well. Anyways, my undereye circles have become more and more prominant and figured this would do the trick. Even after applying two layers with a brush, this was no better than store concealers. I've been sticking with Neutrogena 3 in 1 and Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Erase Dark Cirles. The combination of both (yes, I need layers and layers) tends to do the trick for now until I can come across something that is better.",0
did not get my makeup off,0
I actually bought this at ulta but it's so good I wanted to leave a review here too. I have severe hormonal cystic acne and a few bumps on my forehead. This is the only thing I've used that actually helps clear my skin. I've used this several times normally 3 times a week and it works wonders. I absolutely love this stuff. I recommend applying in sections as it dries quickly and a little goes a long way. If you have acne please try this you won't regret it. I can actually wear makeup again without it looking cakey because it literally smooths out my skin. I've tried 100's of dollars of masks from cheap to very pricey and this one is by far the best and I highly doubt I'll ever quit using. I also reccomend using a gel mouisturizer after as it won't clog pores and leaves skin feeling so clean and soft!,1
Did not cover my gray.,0
"It really works, there has been an improvement to my hair since I started using this product.",1
"I wear contacts,  irritated my eyes.
Brush too big, messy to apply. Not worth the price, other mascaras that are inexpensive, work so much better apply and no racoon eyes!",0
"I was a bit worried because this Wen Re Moist Intensive Treatment was so much less expensive than on the competitors website that I feared it may be fake as like one other reviewer.  If you pull up images on Google of the container and label, you will notice slightly different ""shades"" of yellow/cream on the label.  Mine looks almost exactly like the picture but the shaded areas around the circle are more grey than brown which could be just the camera that was used to take the image.

When opening the product for the first time it smelled amazing.  It is a thick cream consistency and slightly greasy to the touch.  Since I had already washed and dried my hair I tried it by using it more as a leaving in conditioner rather than washing it out.  The product worked immediately and made my blonde, dried out, frizzy, hair smooth and supple.  That alone gives it a five star review.

I'm not sure why but it was still bothering me that the product could be fake so I took the ingredients label and compared it to the ingredients on the real Wen website and they were a perfect match.  Not that the label couldn't be fake too but I feel if the product was fake, they did a terrific job making a knock off and in the end all that really matters is that I have a product that smells wonderful and corrects the horrible damage that's been done to my hair.  My guess is that other websites are selling it at the ""suggested retail"" price of $58 because there are buyers out there willing to pay.  My guess is that this seller is selling legitimate Wen products that were the rejects from the manufacturer due to the label being slightly discolored. (think Ross or TJ Maxx).  That's just my opinion.",1
Love it!!!,1
This is a great razor however they don't do good quality control over at merkur or amazon. The razor chrome handle had a minor chip mark on the top part and it exposes the interior of the razor. Razor will probably rust at a faster rate due to this. I guess the added amazon discount is the price you pay. I know nothing is perfect but this is the second razor I received this week like this from amazon-Not to happy!!! Btw this is the new remade version it's about as mild as a 34c. Bring the old 37 design back!,0
I use this first thing in the morning to wake my skin up and then apply moisturizer.,1
Nice smell. Too expensive!!!,1
"It smells like nail polish and chemicals! Not what I expected from all the great reviews about the smell! Its only a tiny tube for such an expensive price! Plus my dry skin was actually okay before I used this and know my skin is flaking and it feels like a cactus! I don't know what other reviewers were thinking but I've used this product for two weeks and the results are horrible! I didn't get this on discount or wasn't offered it for free for a product review, but other reviewers did so that tells me something!",0
horrible if you have thin hair. it literally made my hair fall out. I have heard this complaint from others via my hair dresser. gave it away.,0
The straighter came to my house and the power cord is cut off not even in the box. I guess merry Christmas from someone special.,0
don't like,0
Good product.  It is hard to find a good lip gloss with high SPF.  I keep it in my purse and use it all the time.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because the color is not as bright as I had hoped.  It is more peach than coral,1
4 stars for the price - quite a bit for the amount you get. Good smell and works well,1
love it. good service,1
Love love love!,1
"Product is excellent, but it was not properly sealed and leaked in transit. Ordered two bottles and both of them leaked. Other providers seal product with tape prior to shipment to prevent this issue.",0
"I received this as a gift based on a recommendation from a friend who uses it and likes it. I have straight hair which was smooth at the time I tried this product. I was very careful to roll slowly, as I've always had a hard time with round brushes getting stuck in my hair. About three strands in, it got stuck and literally would not roll out. As you can see, I had to cut a large chunk of my hair out. My friend who likes this product also had the product get stuck in her hair but she was able to eventually get it out. If you have ever had difficulty with round brushes stay far away from this product!",0
good quality but a poor design the bite is so shallow it does a worse job that my cheapest disposable razors--if you are thinking about getting an old safety razor design do not go with this one get an adjustable,0
"Still makes my hair a little crunchy, but its holds pretty well and adds nice texture nonetheless",1
Shampoo works freat for my 2 daughters who swim daily. The okly complaint I have is that twice ive received the product with the lid not closed tightly and had leaked.,1
Leaves my face smooth and radiant! Highly recommended.,1
"This doesn't smell like the Burberry Brit Sheer Eu de Toilette at Macy's, which I fell in love with. I am disappointed.",0
"I was recommended this product by a dermatologist. They said it would help with facial redness and it would also moisturize. The moisturize part of the creme worked as intended, but I was not overly impressed. This product also carriers an spf of 15 which should help a little with burning. I noticed a little bit of facial redness relief after a few days of putting this on before I would leave the house in the morning. Overall, I would look elsewhere for a better relief cream.",0
I had used the Super Smile system since January. I HONESTLY see a big difference in the color of my teeth. I bought this to use ans an 'upkeep'. Remember to use with a dry toothbrush.,1
Best eyeliner Ive used since the 60s.,1
Have had this product for 4 months and one side already isn't heating up. Major disappointment.,0
"(UPDATE 10-13-2017)- Been using this for a while now, and I am impressed even more than originally.  This stuff is great and the price is right too, compared to other lines I mentioned below.  I highly recommend this cream, again if you can tolerate the fragrance which I have gotten used to.
----------------------

I have been using and exploring skin care for quite some time now, so I have had a chance to use many different brands at a wide variety of price points.  Let's see how Vichy Neovadiol Compensating Complex compares to the creams I have used.

WHAT TYPES OF CREAMS HAVE I USED
Some of the creams that I have used are as follows
Lancome Absolue
Lancome Renergie Multi Action
Algenist Firm and Lift
Algenist Genius
Loreal Vitalift
Yes to Blueberries
L'Occitane
SKII
L'Oreal Genesis
LaPrarie
Clarins
Christian Dior (variety of them)
Chanel
Shiseido

The above list only reflects some of the brands I have had a chance to explore and test out.  Keeping this in mind, I will compare this cream for effectiveness and what results it achieves.

WHAT IS THIS CREAM LIKE?
Vichy Neovadiol Compensating Complex is indicated to be for mature skin that is post menopausal.  That means that the targets are for plumping skin, shrinking pores, radiance, making skin feel denser (thus more youthful), contours, and more of an even tone to skin.  This cream does not have SPF in it which I am THRILLED about.  If you want to use SPF, then you can put it on yourself.

The jar is glass another feature that I like.  It has a tight fitting cap with an inner seal which helps the cream from drying out.  The color is a beautiful iridescent peach color glass and the cream inside is an icy peachy pink color.  It is a bit thicker than the night version of this cream&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vichy-Neovadiol-Replenishing-Care-Night-Cream-1-69-fl-oz/dp/B017R8MYGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vichy Neovadiol Replenishing Care Night Cream, 1.69 fl. oz.</a>.

HOW DOES THIS CREAM PERFORM?
When applying this cream, it is extremely lightweight- not at all thick and sticky like you might expect.  It goes on easily and absorbs VERY quickly into the skin.  The best way to put it on is to dot about a lentil to pea sized dot on each quadrant of the face and then spread it into the skin.  There is a very heavy scent to this, which I have to be honest at first with the night cream made me want to retch, but I quickly got used to it.  Many people would probably find it pleasant, but at first it was hard to get used to.

I have used this with the night cream at night so the combination of the action is to be considered.  I find that the cream leaves my skin very plump, glowy, moisturized for 12 hours until I use the night cream, and there is absolutely no sticky residue.  I find that it does seem to work best when I apply&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/99-Natural-Hyaluronic-Acid-Serum-1-fl-oz-29-6-ml-Liquid/dp/B008PPXBA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">99% Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum 1 fl oz (29.6 ml) Liquid</a>&nbsp;on BEFORE any moisturizer and after cleansing the skin.  I use this with all skin care as it improves performance greatly.

This skin care line will enable you to have a much better canvas to use makeup on for older women.  I do makeup on older women quite often and one of the biggest problems is not using really good skin care first.  This skin care (along with the night cream) will greatly improve the skin so that makeup application will be much nicer and less apt to look caked on.

I would say that this is an excellent skin care line for mature skin if you can tolerate the fragrance.

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS CREAM
Excellent price for what you get
Glass jar
A little goes a long way
It is not sticky
Absorbs quickly
Differences begin quickly
Does what it promises

WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THIS CREAM
Fragrance is a bit overbearing.

THE BOTTOM LINE
I have to say compared to the other lines of skin care that I have tried over the years on myself and on others whose skin I work on, this line of Neovadiol Compensating Complex is a serious contender for performance with good price range compared to high end.  I would put it in the same ball park as some of Lancome, Algenist, Dior, SKII, and I find it even better than some Chanel, Shiseido, Clarins, and L'Oreal (although this company appears to have ties with L'Oreal).  I really do not like the heavy scent, but I did get used to it.  It does not make my eyes water, and it fades away quick enough to be able to use it.  For the price vs performance, compared to other lines, I have to say this is a five star, although I am tempted to give it four stars due to the fragrance.

If you or someone you know has mature skin this would be a great cream to try out to improve makeup application and skin appearance.",1
Came in broke can't use unless you uncsrew the cap,0
Does what it's suppose to.,1
nice feel,1
"First I liked it, now that its gone I won't reorder again, I placed an order with more trusted brand and did pay much more, but I know it works. Anyhow, this lotion is good for hydration but thats it. I didn't see much improvement in 1,5 months, so if its lift skin you looking for, won't find it here for sure.",0
I really don't see a difference and the price is to high,0
I have to say I am extremely disappointed . It is a really cheap product in its manufacturing . It is dffucult to use and the brushes in the dryer are really flimsy . I won't be recommending g or to anyone. So sorry but I can't find a positive comment.,0
"I have used several brands of hair powder, this is my least favorite. I like the Rock Your Hair Brand better, this one just doesn't have the same holding power.",0
It has not worked for me as others have stated or as the product stated it would. Sometimes a visit to the dermatologist is the best bet.,0
It used to take at least 30 minutes to dry my hair.  Now I can dry it in about 10 minutes and it looks a lot better.,1
The worst hair spray I have ever used and the Most expensive. Leaves your hair feeling so sticky. Would have returned it but not allowed as it is an aerosol can,0
"The way these products smell remind me of old women scenrs; they're overwhelming, and it took me five separate handwashing while really scrubbing my hands to get this sent off.",0
"This is my husbands favorite beard control and relaxer. It is hard to find in stores so I am so glad I found it on Amazon. We have tried the jack brand and multiple other brands from the salon and ""barber"" recommendations. We found this 3 years ago and he's been talking about it ever since. Controls the beard without makes it greasy or waxy!",1
This product may work for some but my hair texture which is very fine hated this product. It was very sticky and never made my hair feel drier. If anything it made me feel like I needed to wash it asap.,0
Item was as described.,1
"Found one bottle of this on the clearance rack for 3.99 at Ross, then looked it up online and found the price of one bottle can be as high as 39 bucks! I have some skin discolorations on my foot where the skin is lighter than the rest of me and got this to even it out and it worked with the first application and came out tan like my natural tone not orange so I was very pleased. I was thinking I may try it on the rest of me tonight but after seeing how much it cost i think i will just save it to camoflage my imperfections lol. One thing buyers may want to be informed about though is that you will probably want to apply it at night because for about half an hour you will be the color of a translucent egg plant! It goes on purple-ish, which is good because you can see all the spots you have hit but you definately don't want to spray this stuff on 10 minutes before you have to leave the house unless you want to get a stare down every where you go! Lol.",1
"I love all of Avene's products. I think they are great quality and my skin would not be the same without them. That's why I was so surprised I hated this lip balm. It was chalky, heavy and didn't penetrate my lips. If this is your first Avene purchase please don't let it deter you. It's really a great line.",0
"This product works the the best out of all the fast acting acne treatments I 've tried. It's not a miracle treatment ,but does reduce size of pimples overnight.  It is more for use of spot treatment.",1
"I use this for sunscreen in my hair. I am blond and turn brassy very quickly as i swim and kayak in the ocean a lot. I was not able to find it in any salons and had used it before, so I was happy to find it on Amazon.",1
"I always use a serum before my moisturizing cream, but this is kind of like a serum and cream in one.  Not quite a cream and not quite a gel, this ""Drench & Quench"" is somewhere in between, but has a lot of the benefits of both.  I'm in my fifties so I like super-hydration and this provides it.  My skin feels moisturized all day.  The smell is neutral, almost a light ocean fragrance, and very subtle, almost unnoticeable.  Ultimately, I'm really frugal so the bottomline for me is always the price and though this isn't the cheapest product out there, it's a substantial sized jar and it only takes a very small amount to cover my entire face and neck so it will last a long time - and I don't need a serum with it, so that saves, too.  All and all, after trying this as a sample, I would definitely buy it for my daily routine.",1
"I love it, very refreshing..",1
"Love everything about this, but I'm giving it 4 because it's darker than in photos. The color is more brown than mauve. Still love it and will wear it often.",1
It is easy to apply,1
Lends control to my friz.  Little dab will do ya.  At this rate it will last me several years.,1
This product completely dries out my hair and did not brighten it at all!,0
"I heard so many good things about this product.  However, it didn't work at all on my curly hair.",0
Like this Neuma Argan oil.  Just make sure to only use a drop on short hair or it will make it  look oily,1
"Didn't seem to do anything for me.  The bottle is too small, not enough content to make a proper judgement as to effectiveness...",0
"I have tried many brand of dry shampoo, and this is by far my favorite! It makes your hair look clean and fresh, adds volume and smells nice. It is not powdery at all. Love this--it is worth the price!",1
"I cannot review this polish as I will never open it. I wanted a bright tangerine orange for fall. This polish is the color of a shiny new copper penny. Not orange...  No red.  This cannot be returned so I am out $15 for nothing. My manicurist nor her clients would take it due to the ugly color.  I have brand new Apple devices that display colors accurately so I chose this color expecting what I viewed online. Big mistake.  I am ""awarding"" this product one star as I cannot post ""no stars"".",0
Laura Geller Baked Blushes are so excellent in their coverage. They always leave an even rich tone to my face neck and chest as if I have a perfect complexion.,1
"Only tried it once, it felt heavy and sticky in my hair.",0
"Delivered when promised.  I have several skin allergies and happy to have a top coat that ""stays on"" and seems to not bother my skin.",1
I use this for setting makeup and its great.,1
It arrived as promised and is what I expected.,1
It is poor quality,0
I love this product and all products from billy jealousy there products work great and always good prices I will not use any other product but billy jealousy,1
"I ordered this and the first bottle that i received the cap was open and more then half of the shampoo went into the bag and box.  I could not send this back because it was a mess and got all over me, the floor and all over my desk.  I ordered it again which i received today and the same thing.  The cap is loose and the shampoo is all over the bag.  I will send this one back",0
It's a very pretty color that I got for my wife. I love it. It just looks great on her.,1
"Very handy and compact.  Fits perfect in my makeup bag...doesn't take up much space which is great.  The color looks really bright but it goes on very nicely.  It is a bubble gum pink color however when I apply it, it just looks like the perfect natural flush. My natural skin tone is a light ivory beige with a neutral warm undertone and this looks great on me.",1
"Didn't like this product at all. It is very difficult to handle and the curls, if at all you get them, come out in a weird shape. Product didn't come with good ""how to"" instructions either. Not recommended.",0
didn't work well...,0
"I have owned two of these flat irons.  The first, I purchased from my stylist, who ordered it for me because it was the one he used, and I liked it so much.  After using it for about six months, one side, the side with the controls, stopped heating.  I loved it so much that I used a clip to MacGuyver the two sides together so that the broken side would heat up.  I finally got on Amazon, found another and ordered it.  Stupid me, I didn't fill out the warranty because I thought it was my own carelessness that caused the first one to fail.  I had dropped it more that once, and wasn't careful about how I stored it.  This time, I was extremely careful with it:  hung it up after each use, never left it on too long, etc.  Six months later, the side with the controls on it failed again.  I plan to try to take the first one apart to see if there is a loose wire or something or if there is a short or something.  I don't expect to fix it, but I'd like to see why it failed.  It's too bad.  One of the best appliances I've ever owned.",0
oily on hair,0
"I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",1
"it does not work, the plates do not heat after turn on. I would like to refund for this products",0
Not moisturizing at all. Definitely not worth paying the high price for. I didn't see any difference as compared to the $10 products over the counter.,0
"Free refills are available for the life of the curler if you just go to the manufacturer's website. Be sure to show what model you have. I bought the MT-036. I think the offer is under ""Contact Us"". I love this curler and I hope to have it for a long time. The only thing I might have changed was to order a different color because the black makes it hard to see your eyelashes in the curler. I like to try to curl them evenly.",1
"The rollers get way too hot.  I actually burned my scalp.  I would have to unplug it and wait a minute before I put the rollers in.  I have only had the unit a little over a month and two of the rollers have already broke.  One roller I dropped on the floor once and something inside of it broke and it won't get hot.  I don't know how the other one broke.  I didn't drop it.  The end will not stay on the roller, but it does still get hot.",0
"I've been buying this deodorant for some time, so for that reason I will give it a few stars. But something must have changed with the pricing because I used to get 3 containers. Now, I just inadvertently paid $16 for a 2.5 oz container of deodorant. Seems excessive and I'll be moving on.",0
After less than 30 uses the purple coating starts peeling off. Before that it was great. There are numerous reviews documenting the same situation but Hot tools still does nothing to correct the problem. I have had 20.00 curling irons last for years. This one was 59.00 and last less than 30 days before peeling.,0
Probably is a good product but the fragrance reminded me of frgrances from the 1950's.,0
"Love this diffuser. Easy on and off. It works great on my very thick and curly hair. Of course, the real star is my Elchim dryer.",1
"WE LOVE THIS COLOR!
It looks a little different then in the photo but almost the same. I gave it to my pregnant daughter as a good alternative to other brands with harsher chemicals.",1
Absolutely the best straightener I have ever bought. It works great on curly/thick/unruly hair and seals the cuticle of the hair so you won't have that frizziness even after going outside. However warning it does get extremely hot so it does affect the nature of your hair. After two months of using it my natural curl has loosened.,1
"I had a difficult time getting this to rinse off the blade.  I had to choose between a mediocre shave and unscrewing the razor and wiping the cream off every other pass.  I do have hard water (ph 8.8), so this may have contributed to the issue.

It did protect my skin from nicks and leave me moisturized.  The smell was pleasant and slight.",0
"Nice smell, overly expensive.",1
"Struggling to find a more eloquent way of saying ""useless trash.""

Zero hold, zero texture. Tried using this in a number of different scenarios: wet hair, damp hair, dry hair, washed, unwashed. Each yielded the same result - absolutely nothing. You'd be better off putting hand lotion in your hair, at least it would be cheaper.",0
I love that s partum. It is very refreshing and the scent lasts thru the day.,1
"I like Burts Bees tinted lip balm (less $$$) but Jane Iredale ""crush"" balm has nicer texture and yummy smell so $$$ price is justified. Other brands have prettier hues though. I don't use conventional lipstick as it usually contains lead",1
"I was bummed that this didn't work for me because I love their self tanner foam for body. I barely noticed any color when I put it on, and it was a bit too thick feeling on my face, so when I rubbed it in it didn't blend in evenly.",0
Not much scent...must be a knock off.,0
"It seems I'm on a constant search for a quality under eye concealer. I have very fair skin and constant dark circles. I've tried expensive products (like Smashbox) and $10 and under drug store products (Cover Girl, Maybelline, etc.). I'd say this product is comparable in quality to a drug store product with the price of an expensive brand.

The product does go on very smoothly, and I think it will last a long time--a little bit goes a long way. But as far as coverage goes, it doesn't last through the day. For the last several days, I've applied my Cover Girl stick under one eye and the em cover up under the other eye. The em has a more yellow tinge, but once I put my foundation over it, the yellow disappears. By noon, the dark circles are completely back. I've come to expect it from a cheap product, but from a product that's nearly $20? That's unacceptable. Why would I pay twice the price to have the same result?

I had been very interested in trying Michelle Phan's makeup line, but this product does not make me want to try any of her other products.",0
"Really like this for a couple times a week.  Proven results too, my esthetician said my skin looked much better than my previous visit.",1
"Recommended by my daughter as a daily moisturizer.  I only use it when I need extra protection.  I don't like having ""stuff"" on my face - this is quite light and can be considered the moisturizer as well.",1
Very good product but  a little pricey.,1
"I have used this line for about ten years and if I ever switch to try a new line I always go back.  This plus the Active Serum are total game changers.  A must for flawless, healthy, smooth skin.",1
This cream is an affordable alternative to the outrageously expensive Forever Flawless cream I once used.  I love Revision Nectifirm.,1
Not bad.....,1
Amazing quality; The heat settings are fabulous and I've been able to create a much better look at home while using this product,1
Good product but hair seems kind of dry.,1
The product is pretty good. but Sephora only sells for $10,1
Love the fragrance:),1
Seriously. This facial moisturizing cosmeceutical is among the very best on the market. My skin responds beautifully to the Neova line-up of skincare. I hope ProCyte never goes out of business because that would be a terrible shame. I've tried many other products and none compare.,1
"Just don't buy it, it is not working as you think!",0
"This is a great product but the bottle advertised is 4.2oz, while what you actually receive is 1.5oz bottle!",0
I don't see any difference in the firmness of my neck skin. Save your money.,0
My husband tried this and did not like it. It is a very thick cream and leaves a sticky residue on his face. It was very bothersome to him so he ended up washing his face with soap to remove the product.,0
"This is not the real cologne. I have a bottle of genuine Mont Blanc, and whatever is in this bottle is not the same stuff. For starters, the spray nozzle was either broken or tampered with because it sat crooked on the top, and the fragrance wasn't even close to the strength of what I used to have. I even had someone other than me do a comparison, and the smells are barely similar. Amazon gave me a full refund. I would suggest looking elsewhere for this, and if you think this fake smell is good wait until you smell the real deal it will change your life. Also, the stickers on the bottom were different. The one I had prior had a much bigger, nicer sticker that had the address of the manufacturing facility and a lot more info. The fake just had a little sticker with a few things on it. Buyer beware!",0
Nice,1
Does not hold heat. Bought two same result.,0
"Moisturizes very well, but does not stay very long. Product is listed as 0.3 oz, but I received 0.2 oz which is the only reason for a lower rating.",0
Came half empty,0
"Maybe the barrel is too big? But my curls don't last that long and I hate it (I've tried so many ways: starting from top to bottom, bottom to top, etc). Also, it makes my hair smells funky. Maybe a smaller barrel would work better.",0
"So I have had this product for about 9 months now.  I thought that this would be like every other hair removal product that I have tried.  I am going to give more personal information than I usually would, because this has been such a huge part of my life for about 20 years, and it is such a relief not to have it be a constant concern.  In my early 20's I started noticing a lot of facial hair.  I used bleach, home waxing systems and tweezers. It got to be where I would spend an hour a day plucking facial hair......really not great for my self esteem. If I shaved the area, there were dark spots, or five o'clock shadow. By my late 20's they started laser hair removing, I went spent a couple hundred dollars getting it done, the problem was I would have to go back to frequently for my finances.  I kept tweezing because I didn't have to grow out the hair (like I would need to for waxing), Bleaching creams blistered my skin, although I don't consider myself to have sensitive skin, they just didn't work for me.  Now I have always had long dark arm hair and a beard, mustache and sideburns.  I also have a patch of dark hair on my upper chest.  I of course had medical checkups to make sure my thyroid and hormone levels were ok, it was always ok.  Last summer I bought this on Amazon.  I read many reviews I thought Kasia's review was so helpful and decided that even if it lessened the amount of hair I would be happy.  I have used it about once a month (2 times a month) for the first month.  I can now go a week without even worrying about any facial hair (from 1 hour every day of tweezing). When the hair grows back it in finer and somewhat lighter so less noticeable.  I have zapped my arms four times now and only have a couple of spots that pop back up.  I know their is a cycle to hair growth, so I believe that over time I maybe hair free, but even if not, I feel like my life has been given back to me.  I am considering doing my legs and underarms now.  If I could return everything I ever bought to be free from facial hair, I would be able to buy like 5 of these, lol.  My only regret is not having bought this sooner, but I really believed that it would be like all the other, how glad I am that I was so wrong!",1
"I bought Replenix based on the online review of a dermatologist who suggested it's use with the Obagi system (which can be drying and irritating). I found Replenix to be just OK- not cooling and soothing as advertised. I paid $43 and the bottle is quite small. I can see already, that I'll have to dismantle the bottle to get all the product out of it. I wouldn't buy it again.",0
"I didn't really see a difference in my hair. I wanted to, as this was very pricy! I had to refund it.",0
Love! Works wonders!,1
Definitely helped my eyebrows grow in stronger.,1
"While this product holds your hair well, it contains too much clay for my liking. I literally felt like I had clay in my hair all day and when I would run my hand through my hair during the day, it would come out with a bit of clay on it such that I felt the need to then wash my hands.

I much prefer&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Crew-Fiber-3-0-oz/dp/B0008IV7BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Crew Fiber 3.0 oz.</a>&nbsp;which performs nearly almost as well but doesn't leave your hair all clay-like. It's also cheaper.

On the plus side, this product comes in a nice cool glass can and smells great.",0
Greasy stinging feeling after using for 3 weeks not a good product,0
Love this for my oily combination skin. The product absorbs well and it isn't heavy or greasy. I feel like I go through this faster than my usual moisturizers. I would love see this in a bigger bottle!,1
I bought this online for a fraction of the cost at a beauty supply chain. It only take a pea size amount for my use. Great purchase!,1
"What a fun and unique bright pink. This color is thinner then the darker Essie colors making it a lot smoother and easier to paint. It's not as neon as I thought it would be, however, it's still a bright and fun color. If you want true neon, I would recommend China Glaze Pink Voltage instead.",1
"Love the color! Not waterproof. Gray-Green is really hard to find in an eyeliner. This is close and it stays just ok. If your eyes water or you sweat, forget it. It disappears.",1
Do not use...I repeat..do not use. This mascara was horrible to remove. I had to rub my eye raw to get it off. Never experienced anything like this before.,0
Simply amazing,1
I didn't LOVE this color. The product was not worth the money. There was only about an inch worth of blush. I rolled it all the way up and couldn't believe that's all there was!,0
This soap broke me up in a horrible rash. My face and neck are bright red and swollen.,0
Cheaper on here by $30 over my demo office. Love this product!,1
This mascara does not smudge off as other reviews have mentioned but I do not like the way it makes my eyelashes look. This mascara does not add visible volume or length to my lashes.,0
Colors and texture are much different than i expected. The color is too light and the texture is too thin.,0
"Cute, but very small for the money",0
"I've been using this cream for almost a month now. The ""Anti-Aging Need"" in the description states for Post-Menopausal Aging. Since I've been post menopausal for over 20 years now I think I qualify. :-)  (Why do they show young women on ads for older women's products?)

Even though this jar only holds 1.69oz. it does last a long time because I only use a dab at a time and spread it around my face. It's a thick silky cream that is not at all sticky or greasy, absorbs into the skin, and has a pleasant mild scent (to me it could have more scent). I've probably used less than half the jar so far. I had another Vichy product that I really liked that was a lot more floral scented.

So, does it help plump the appearance of my wrinkles? Not that I can tell, at least not so far. Does it provide hydration? I'd say yes. Is it worth the price? To me, no, but I have never been one to wear much makeup or worry about wrinkles (I earned them, after all). I do like the feel of the cream on my face and I feel like I'm pampering myself when I use it.",1
"I also bought this shampoo at TJ Maxx.  It does smell good, but just as the other reviewers mentioned its very drying.  I am going to use maybe once or twice a month to get rid of build up.",0
"Returned. Smelled like old, staled perfume.",0
"I love Davines product and Minu is my go to, however when I received my product the container was cracked and the safety seal was off and inside the container.",0
Was curling my hair and smelled wires burning and did not realize it was my curling iron. I have all types of irons for 5-10 years and they are still in good condition. I am so upset.,0
"The product is great but my only concern,with this being the second bottle that I have ordered, the bottle seems to only be half full, compared to when I purchased directly from my aesthetician. I will continue to purchased this brand of Hyaluronic.",1
Absolutely loved it up until it stopped heating. Now jumps to 487 degrees with no heat and it's not even supposed to go that high. Didn't have it for any longer than a year. Very disappointed.,0
"I love micellar waters on those days when I'm too rushed for time to cleanse with a sonic device.
This version works exceptionally well as a 'refresher' as well as a cleanser.
It has a delightful scent, very fresh.
Saturate a few cotton rounds and swipe gently over your face. Not hard...the water does the work.

My only problem is that despite being wrapped in bubble wrap, the product leaked out into the mailing envelope. A seal on the top would have avoided this.",1
Good!,1
"This is my daily face and neck sunscreen. It's got a great consistency and leaves a matte look. It mutes a bit of the morning redness. If I try to apply makeup straight after I put it on, I feel like my makeup slides around a little too much for my liking. Although it seems to be OK if I leave it a while.",1
Waaaay too much fragrance.  Who can walk around with this on their head? It's AWFUL!,0
Went totally dead after 5 months! Just wouldn't turn on.,0
"I suffer from chronically chapped lips caused by a condition called Sjogrens Syndrome (drys out everything!).  Most commercial products I've tried don't provide lasting relief, so when my stand-by was discontinued about a year ago, I started buying anything I came across that promised comfort to dry lips.  They are now sorted in bags of don't work, kinda work & wonderful so I won't repeat buy the wrong product.  The Lip Slip is the only product currently in this last category (I stopped testing when it worked) - I love it.  I may buy a case to be sure I never run out...  I only need to apply a few times during the day (when I wake up / go to bed, after eating), and my lips no longer peel or feel like they will split apart.  Did I say I love this product?",1
"Too small.  Too expensive.  Took way too long to get. Product is ok, just too much trouble.
Would not buy again.",0
muy buen producto,1
"I guess this kind of works BUT it takes SOOOO long to do even a small area AND the fact that you have to lift it up for each hair makes it unusable if you're trying to do something like your butt or back or legs or whole chest... basically, this thing is really only good for VERY patient people who only want to treat VERY small areas and ALREADY don't have much hair there. THAT'S IT. If that's not you, don't waste your time with this.",0
Great for making your hair thicker !!,1
"I have very naturally oily and flat hair, so every evening after a day of working, I will need to use some dry shampoo to refresh. While I like the dry shampoo and how it dries the hair at the base of my scalp, it doesn't really help too much with volume. I decided to try this hair powder as people had deemed it to ""work miracles.""
It's a very odd texture that almost feels sticky at first. The powder is white, but didn't make my hair that mousey grey color that some of the white dry shampoos do. Using it took me a little bit of getting used to  as you almost need to tease the base of the hair to get it volumized. I first tried putting it on my hands and then onto my hair, but I found that most of the powder just stuck to my hands. Applying directly to the hair on your scalp is my recommended way of applying. Once I got the hang of it, I really liked the results! It definitely helps with my overall volume. The texture of my hair after using it is a little odd, so that also took some getting used to. If you're looking to use for a long day, it might need some application. This size container is perfect for throwing in your purse.",1
"Great going on, but, a little tough to remove",1
"I own a solano blow dryer and it fits great pops on and off well. should fit most blow dryers, but I bought it specifically to fit my solano dryer",1
Very difficult to apply  the color in a thin line.  I ended up not using it and throwing it away.,0
"I bought this item to do my own facials at home.  The product is good but I highly advise to be careful.  The first time I tried it, I actually scraped both sides of my face.  It literally took the top layer of my skin off as a streak.  It is strong enough to do the job it is intended for but be very careful.  Hoping this will heal soon and not leave a scar.  Yikes!",1
"Good price for size, mysterious and bold scent :) Great if you like a night time scent with a bit of spice",1
Broken and leaking,0
Just what I was looking for travel sizes for my vacation.,1
Not worth the price,0
"as a professional i have used this every tool every week now for a year and its still working well. i like the adjustable temperature and it heats up quickly within a couppla minutes, i would buy it again.
it should come with a marcel handle, as the spring clip and rubber top is for amateurs.",1
I love this lotion but when I received this Calvin Klein body lotion yesterday and I didn't get a cap/ or a pump with it. This is also a  Christmas gift,0
Great product to apply before powder makeup,1
Love it for thickening my hair shafts prior to using the Toppik hair fibers.  Great product.  Can't live without it,1
"Hated it, applied exactly as instructed, nails peeled underneath. Emailed OPI but they never responded.",0
Pretty great for resurfacing your skin and getting rid of acne scars. I was able to notice the results within a few days and it was non-irritating to my face.,1
"Very poorly designed. The peg that holds the brush head to the base BROKE OFF. A useless, overpriced device. The customer service is as worthless as the defective, over-priced garbage toothbrush. Save your money & buy something else!",0
"We got this item for my daughter for christmas she used it 2 times on the 3rd time she plugged the item in and the item began to spark and catch on fire. She was not able let go of the item until the fire burned through both wires and then she was able to let go. When we took her to the ER she has 2nd degree burns and blisters. We will be watching for nerve damage in the hand.
This is a horrible item that was NOT purchased through amazon but through a different vendor. We felt we needed to let everyone know this is a safety hazard. For an item to heat to 450 degrees there is no ground plug no breaker reset nothing just an ordinary flimsy plug. We  did take the item to the fire department and since there were no scortching no burns in the wall and the burns are limited to her hand and the full plug itself the fire waslimited to the device and not the house or outlet.",0
It does work very well. Makes my hair smooth just like in the salon. It's a little heavy but definitely worth the price.,1
Holds great and shine is moderate which I like. My wife did say it smelled a little girly which I do agree with.,1
Barrel too short and I burned my fingers. I bought a thermal glove which was very hard to manage. Returned the item.,0
"The iron looks then in the picture but it's really thick , I thought it was 1 or 1 1/2 inches",0
This tan mitt does not protect hands from self tan lotion staining. It does work to smooth out the lotion if you wear plastic gloves and have already put on the lotion and rubbed it in first.,0
"When I read a review stating this smelled like an ashtray, I thought no way. Well, it does smell like an ashtray. It stinks. However, it is not unbearable and it works to clear up oily, acne prone skin.",1
I received this slightly scratched / damage. But I'll still take it as I'm urgently in need,0
"I love this product, I use about 1 1/2 pumps, rub my hands together & work it thru towel dried hair. Comb thru it while it is still damp for straight look, or just leave it as is after I work it thru my hair for a curly look (my hair is layered).  Works best if you can let it dry on its own, if not, blow dry on the lowest setting your blow dryer has. I use a flat iron for the straight look or I just leave it for the curly look.  Do not comb or brush curly look, I just use my fingers to style it.",1
Best product I have ever found for keeping feet soft. Even the calluses soften up. Great for all year round use. Amazon had best price with free prime shipping.,1
This burns!!!!!,0
It's a good razor. I'm learning how to wet shave. It's an art.,1
"Does the trick, but smells awful. Smells like dirt when you put it on & wet dog when it settles in. I would not buy this product again or recommend it. You can find a better product that does the same thing & doesnt smell so bad.",0
Its a little watery but it smells great,1
My daughter love's this product,1
Spa in your own bathroom...exquisite scent and your relaxed!  This is been a tried and true favorite of mine for 15 years.  The entire line is worth every dime.,1
"I really like this serum.  It doesn't have a strong odor, it goes on smoothly and my skin doesn't feel sticky after use.  The bottle is supposed to last about two months if used as directed...so essentially it will cost you about $50/month to use this product.  While I liked it, any may notice a slight difference, I feel like the before and after should be more dramatic for as pricey as this serum is.  I know beauty and anti aging products can be expensive, but I have to wonder if it's because the ingredients and science behind it warrant the cost, or if it's because they know that people are searching for that fountain of youth that will halt the aging process and pay just about anything to look young.

Overall I would recommend that you try it and see if your results justify the cost.  For me, the jury is still out on whether I will continue the treatment after I've used all that I have.  I like it, but don't like the price.",1
A good dry shampoo but it really dried out my scalp. I can use it occasionally but not every other day.,0
"The product ""Stila Illuminating Liquid Foundation"" is incredibly watered down. Feels like you're putting paint on your face, as you actually feel it dripping down your skin as you apply. At the same time, it feels heavy and sticky once applied. That being said, I was quite surprised to see how flawless my skin looked after using it. But if you're looking for something that will wear all day, this isn't it.",0
The product shown is not the product that was delivered.,0
This is a thumbs up from everyone in the family. The balm is not like the cream which absorbs better but that's like a barrier to keep the skin hydrated. This is great for my wife and daughter who has slight eczema and there has been a reduction of itchiness or redness when they use this product for their dry skin.,1
"The product itself is great and arrived on time. However did not come as I expected. The seller clearly does not care what is written in the description and what is in the picture. I thought I was ordering a product in a case. I did not know I was ordering a refill. If I knew I was ordering a refill and had a case to refill it with, I would be a happy customer. Based on other reviews, the seller is consistent about not informing people exactly what they are ordering. I will avoid ordering any make up from them in the future unless I need a refill or feel like playing roulette with what product I might actually get.",0
This is a legit seller! Love this stuff and the light scent it has. A must!! I put it on after a shower no matter if I use heat on it or not and I put some on after blow drying to smooth and shine.,1
"I've tried about everything, this is the best cream for toning down my reactive skin.",1
It's good but it doesn't last long,1
The color is very pretty. When the color is curing tho it looks splotchy and messy. At first I thought it was the lamp so I went an got another one and the same thing happened. So I tried a different color of cnd and that one did fine. Very disappointed.,0
"This is a good product.  It gets pretty hot even on the lower setting.  A little tricky to use but gets easier with practice and patience. I don't use it every day, I have fragile medium length color treated blond hair and afraid it will do damage with the heat. It does hold a curl and gives good body to the hair.",1
I first used my daughter-in-laws product and liked it so  well that I looked it up on Amazon.com and purchased my own jar. I am very pleased with  the results so far.  I could feel the product tighten my skin and my face felt great after I washed it off. It also helped close some large pores on my face.,1
I adore this! I do not tan in a tanning bed for it is bad for your skin. I will say if you swim in a chlorinated pool for more than a hour or so it will come off but no worries it doesn't come off patchy! I am not downing sungoddess I have used 3 bottles of it I switch up every now and then but always come back to this for thew sunG will make you a bit darker faster BUT.... it fade soooo splotchy so I don't really care for it! I also recommend this mousse over the st. tropez lotion!,1
"This has a SUPER heavy perfume odor so if you like heavy fragrances perhaps you'll enjoy, but I'm bummed I spend so much money on something that stinks up my entire room",0
Didn't like the way it left my hair feeling.,0
Stopped working after a few uses,0
"Not a great product for thick, kinky, coily hair.  After 6 months of use I noticed I was loosing more hair in my detangling sessions that I used to with my old comb.  I have now gone back to my old methods and my hair is growing back.",0
Good ingredients but very drying.  Made my normally oily skin very tough even with nightly shea butter treatmemt.  Leaves a whitcast and don't know that it protected me from sun very well.  Will not buy again.,0
"Works well and glad I can get it here for the price I do on Amazon. It may not be the absolute best, but it is great for the price you pay.",1
"I was really wanting to try this product but after a month of use I couldn't stand the white, filmy dandruff like effect it does. I would rather go bald than constantly fight the white filmy stuff... Too bad..",0
I purchased this shampoo and conditioner do to all the great reviews I saw on it. Though is is quite expensive if it worked I thought it would be well worth the money. I have long coarse dry wavy to curly hair and have had issues with not getting enough moisture to stay in in my hair especially in the summer. I used this shampoo and conditioner together and later separately thinking the issue could be that it was  moisturizing too much either way it resulted in me having greasy hair by the second day and I eventually started having breakouts on my neck shoulders and back were my hair hits on my body. If you are going to try it get the smaller bottle or a sample so you are not throwing your money away like i did.,0
Love the cleansing creme and the wonderful aromatic scent when applied to the face.  It makes my face feel so clean and refreshed ... will never be without it.  Thank you.,1
Love this lotion and I keep ordering.  Have 3 fragrances that I use by Epicuren.  Not greasy but makes skin soft. Fragrances are wonderful and not overpowering,1
"I sampled the original 8 hour cream at the EA counter & couldn't stand the strong scent. The texture was fantastic though.... I get dry spots on my face & super dry cracked hands during winter. I came across this fragrance-free version & thought I'd give it a shot. I was overwhelmed by a strong rancid oily scent when I opened the cap. That should've been my first warning. I applied a small pea sized amount to both hands & while the salve texture was soothing, the scent was absolutely awful! Not 5 minutes later did you find me on the computer, requesting a return from Amazon. Never again!",0
Made my hair look dirtier.,0
"The glitter is exact and too much so, one looks as if one has sparkly fungi on one's nails.  There are better.",0
"PROS
Great hold
easy styling and restyling
Water based so it doesn't leave my hair feeling greasy
easy to wash out.

CONS
12oz container is large, takes up a lot of counter/drawer space and isn't as easy to travel with as 4oz
because of size lid does not secure very well on the containter I have, but could be better on others

Overall impression
Will buy again but may keep a smaller size for travel",1
this product worked for about 2 hours on the day of a 4th of july party and before that i was so excited to just get it. i have not used it since,0
"I'm not use to such a powerful dryer. It is a little heavy and loud, but it does the trick.  My hair is soft and shiny.",1
"I think it may just be the color, but I wasn't impressed. Suppose to be a pale pink and it looked more like I used white out on my nails. Didn't coat evenly and wasn't true to color of picture.",0
"The curling iron works great, but after 2 years, just stopped clamping for no reason.  I don't use hair spray so there's no rust.  I haven't dropped it, it just won't tighten any longer.  2 years doesn't seem like a good lifespan to me.",0
"I was recommended this by the owner of a salon who loved it for hair regrowth post-cancer treatment and by a woman at another salon who said it was a great product. I'm a man with a significant bald spot that started in my 20s and can be stress, medicine, or mystery cause-related. I have no idea. My doctors don't take it seriously. I used the shampoo alone until gone then bought the full kit. I've used the product a good two years and have seen no difference at all. Not only am I disappointed that it's done nothing (and isn't cheap), but my hair is like straw. It's very dry, frizzy and dull. When it dries, it curls and waves and looks ridiculous. I had to buy a flat iron to straighten my hair out so it looks normal. I've had more nourishment with Walmart-purchased shampoos and hate that I've ""lost"" 2 years to something that didn't help at all. At the least, it could have given me good hair where I DO still have it. I'm going to talk to other doctors/specialists and try something else. Perhaps it's only good for women, but neither salon employee said so to me. Seems hard to find stuff tried and proven on men.",0
"I really loved this product in the past. Several years ago I picked it up at a out of town Sephora before I had one in my city... I LOVED it. I am so picky about  concealers, but this one if AMAZING. Covers my dark circles quite well! Creamy, smooth...builds up great... I can see, though, how someone older than myself wouldn't like it (reading on here) about how it shows your wrinkles. This is for more youthful skin, I think, but overall its a good product. My only complaint is that it seems a little old/ dried out? I think I got shipped a less than high-quality product, but eh. We'll see.... ANYWAYS LADIES, THIS IS A GREAT CONCEALER!!",1
Not organic or natural  but smells GREAT - I use it for myself,1
It was not the real noir!!! I was very upset after I sprayed it and it didn't smell like the perfume I love!!....ZERO staying power,0
"I was very disappointed to see the ingredients list on the item description and the actual item itself did not match. There are a handful on ingredients listed on the bottle that are not natural, including fragrance (parfum)...and the fragrance is that of old lady perfume. Returned this item.",0
This product made my face having seriously allergic reaction.,0
"Paired this with some feather blades and very happy with the purchases. Would definitely recommend and after transitioning to using safety razor, will never go back to disposable. Wished I would have done this years ago. But, the blades do make a difference so don't go cheap there.",1
I have really long and somewhat thick hair and this iron gives me the perfect curl. I also use it as a wand by just wrapping my hair around the barrel without opening the clamp to get the nice loose curl. Great buy.,1
"I was bummed that this didn't work for me because I love their self tanner foam for body. I barely noticed any color when I put it on, and it was a bit too thick feeling on my face, so when I rubbed it in it didn't blend in evenly.",0
Started using this after a chemical peel as it was the only thing the Doctor would let me use. Loved it so much I continue to use it as my day lotion. Very lightweight and moisturizing.,1
Terrible,0
When I opened it today water poured out. I have bought this many times and this has never happened before. I'm not sure why.,0
"Works great on tiny blemishes about to form.  However, larger blemishes need a little more attention - one application won't be enough.  One of the plusses, though, is that it will not fade your bedsheets nor your clothing.",1
The cream is of rich consistency and provides good moisture. But the presence of parabens in this good one made me look into other options as i am getting to have more natural products in my regimen.,1
Very disappointed with the color. Its vertically clear with only a hint of color and sparkles. Doesnt even show on the nail. I may use it to mix with other polishes. ,0
Love! Perfect for my aging combo sensitive skin!  This is the second purchase of this product.,1
I've been using this product for 40 years!! They've changed the formula and now it is much thinner than it used to be!! Very disappointed and will not be buying it again!!,0
"I have been using this as part of my morning routine and it fits right in.  The serum is light weight and perfect for wearing under my foundation or alone.  On days when my skin is feeling especially dry, it also layers nicely with heavier moisturizing creams without making me feel like I'm wearing a thick mask of products.

Nobody wants to feel like their products are caked on.

The scent, which is something I always have to consider as some can cause me to break out or be too intense for me, is not an issue for me at all.  It is light enough not to overwhelm and I didn't experience any skin reaction at all.

With all that said, I get the same benefits and results from the Olay products I use.  I am saying this after using this serum for a few weeks now and seeing no difference in my skin.  I'll probably continue using my far less and just as effective Olay products and would recommend others consider doing the same.  Unless you simply MUST spend so much money on a skin serum, Olay is excellent.",1
This stuff works! Will re order when needed,1
"I've been using this for 4 years now and just love it! It's the first thing that goes on my face every day! Great for calming my ruddy, rosacea-prone Celtic skin tone. Completely disappears into my skin after application - perfect for under your favorite moisturizer as a treatment for redness and as an antioxidant to prevent premature aging.",1
"I say this is not for guys 18-40. I have received compliments from women but they were 40+. I do think this is near perfect for business wear. It smells like ""money"" and business is all about the money.

Good luck,
Matthew",1
"This product is absolutely light and intense. It tightens the skin and has a slight tingle. Don't get it in your eyes, though. It smarts!! I love this product. Pricey, though. No makeup. Just the serum results in the photo included.",1
I'll wait till it goes on Sale at Paul Mitchell Next time.  But it's good stuff.,1
"I was bit disappointed.
The only benefit is Obagi.
Others are just a usual cosmetic samples at the department store, same as usual one time use sample.
Its pricy to me.",0
"Beautifull color, dries quickly, would purchase again",1
I would give it zero stars if I could! This is knock off perfume. It doesn't last long at all (just about 2 min) Don't waste your money!,0
Beautiful and the eye shadow blends like a dream. So worth the money,1
"Got my first Go Curl six and a half months ago. Loved it. Gives me a great, dramatic curl, easy to hold in my hand, and very travel-friendly. Sadly, all-plastic construction and strong leverage lead to a snap this morning during normal use.

While it only lasted six months, it was good enough that I'm buying myself another. I'm hoping the average lifespan is a bit longer!",1
Love the smell,1
Fast shipping! It doesn't burn or make your facial skin peel. Not drying.,1
"I have long, red, THICK hair.  This is BY FAR, the best dryer I have ever owned.  It cuts down my drying time so much, it is unreal.  It has a low, medium, high heat setting and I use the medium.  My cousin borrowed it during a recent trip, and she had to go get one because she loved it so much.  It is lightweight, so it doesn't numb your arm when you are holding it.",1
Moisturizing but haven't noticed improvement in my neck after a month.,0
wish it blended better. its okay,1
"This cream is easy to apply. It doesn't smell bad and the roller does an okay job at application, although I found it easier to spread the cream with my fingertips.  I used the cream for 10 days and did not notice any change to the crepey appearance on the skin of my neck. However, my skin did turn red. The package directions insert said if skin is sensitive, apply sparingly for 7 to 10 days to allow time for the skin to adjust. My skin looked just as red after 10 days so I ceased using it. Still, the fine crepey lines were still there and my neck did not look tighter. While I didn't expect a change to my profile or age-related sagging, since that's impossible with a skin cream, I hoped the crepey appearance would be improved. I'm assuming this topical cream contains an ingredient that tightens as it dries, much like the egg white trick.

I was curious about the claims in the description, such as stating 86 percent felt tighter skin. I wrote the company to ask how many people were surveyed, was this a clinical study, and what were the average ages of those who participated. It's been 10 days and they still have not responded.

This is not a product that I would recommend to my own family and friends. I found that it did not live up to the claims of tightening my skin. It is a decent moisturizer and works as well as any drugstore product. However, I don't think it's worth the high price, especially since many people get bad reactions from the niacin ingredient in the cream. That's just my personal opinion.",0
"My daughter, 15 yo, and myself, old mom, got to play around with both the NUDE and SAND colors.  It was fun.

One thing I can tell you is that neither the SAND nor the NUDE will work for anyone with a really pale complexion.  My daughter is blessed with a peaches and cream complexion and both of these concealers looked like blushes on her.

One the other hand, I with my slightly reddish complexion did fine with both.  Go figure.  I put it on my cheeks where I have a tiny broken vein and both hid it.

PROBLEMS
-- When I say that the SAND and NUDE concealer hid the tiny red line that is my broken vein I mean that if I dabbed them on that they did their job.  If I swiped them on they did not cover the spot.  You have to build up some of the slightly waxy concealer.

-- Which brings up another problem that I noticed.  The moment I put a foundation on over the concealer the concealer vanished.  It would appear to have dissolved and blended too well with the foundation.

-- I also found another test subject.  One with an age spot on her hand.  I've put up two pictures with and without the concealer so you can see it at work.

-- Pale skin.  I talked about it above but if you are pale neither of these concealers will look natural.  With my poor camera skills you might not be able to make out the difference, but I tried to show what they look like on my daughter.

SUMMARY
I'm actually likely to wear this without foundation.  The reason being that if I dab-dab-dabbed it on it certainly covered nicely but it didn't stay put when I tried it with foundation.

If you a pale go with something other than Nude.",0
"Meh...I wanted to like it. Very light and does not have any staying power at all. Does not give you a nice line either, the pencil is thicker than most.",0
Great aftershave in terms of soothing and calming the skin down. Full of patabens though! Does its job very well.,1
"I love this product!!! It smells good, makes my hair silky soft and keeps the frizz away. I highly recommend it!",1
"Not much hold, very sticky on the hands. Sorry I wasted my money.",0
Have used Nioxin 6 for the last 1.5 years. This one feels watered down.,0
I started using this right away and it does help. It reduces the pimple size and redness but it is sooooo drying. I can't use it everyday. But it's good. It works on my skin.,1
"Deodorant aspect is fine, smells nice. Broke out in a painful rash tho. Surprised me as I've always liked Jack Black products.",0
"Pricey? Yes.

Worth it? Absolutely. Every. Penny.

This is the best skin care product of any kind that I have ever used. Clears and moisturizes. Only have to use the smallest bit every day, so while the investment upfront seems like a lot, in the long term it lasts and is better than wasting money on products that don't work.",1
"It's my first bottle, but I like it so far, it feels good on my skin.",1
Did nothing for my hair!  I used it and then flat ironed my iron and my ends got fried!!  And my hair was tangly all day long and looked dull and dried out.  returning!,0
Used once and couldn't stand the smell.  I didn't smell botanicals other than a fake rose.  Sorry!,0
"I really wanted to like this product but it's pretty much colored talc. It made my hair look really dull and to top it off irritated the hell out of my scalp. I used it twice on my roots and had such an intense itch, it was awful. Beware of touching your hair after you apply; this stuff will get all over your hands. I would love to return this product if I could!",0
I should have looked for a curling iron that had a higher temp.,1
They weren't sealed when I received them and the packaging looks dirty. Very disapointed,0
Recently I have had difficulty finding this product in salons and retail stores so was delighted to find this source.  The delivery service was good.,1
"I LOVE the LONDON Butter line and have several colors. I ordered this one with the hopes that it would have a purple shade to it like in the picture but it goes a muted, silver, kind of sparkly, pale color. Not impressed with this color.",0
"I buy this color all the time, they haven't had it in the stores the last couple of times I went so I tired of online. This product is not the same quality nor shade I get in the stores.",0
product was subpar  the seller refunded my money,0
No effect whatsoever! Such a waste...,0
"Does absolutely nothing, huge waste of money. Took mine back for a refund.",0
Product was received on time and in great condition. It also works perfectly and I am happy with my purchase. Love that refills are free for life!,1
"The first thing which strikes you about the fragrance is the shape of the bottle. Its very sleek and sexy.

The perfume is very strong and intense. A single spray is good enough for most people so go easy on it.

This is particularly good for evening parties/events...",1
Love that it doesn't leave  any flakes in my dark hair.  Soaks up oil so hair looks fresh,1
"I used to use Lorac's Nude Moisturizing Lipstick but haven't been able to find any.  I tried this.  It's like trying to draw on your lips with a Crayon.  And once it's on, it looks like hell -- dry and nasty.  Just avoid it!  Maybelline makes a six dollar nude lipstick tha's way better!",0
"Not a huge fan of this shampoo. I have long wavy hair that can get oily near the roots and dry towards the tips.  This shampoo felt like it dried my hair out in general.  If I mixed it with Joico moisture shampoo it worked relatively well (2-3 pumps each).  The aroma wasn't bad, not my favorite, but not too bad.  I wish it had a stronger mint fragrance to it.",0
Very stiff and Not as soft as my old emi jay hair ties. They leave a very distinct mark from where it was. However the colors are nice.,0
"I have used dry shampoo for a long time.  My favorite brand was discontinued so I've been trying different brands.  I like this product the best but either I got a defective bottle or the design is horrible.  I couldn't get it to work, but that wasn't a problem because I use another bottle for my dry shampoo usually anyway.",1
"This didn't work for me at all. By midday I was sweaty and smelled bad, no matter what temperature it was outside. I had to stop using it.",0
"I have fine hair and had hoped that if I used just a real, tiny amount it would be okay, but not so at all.  No amount of this is small enough for fine hair, period.  I gave my bottle to a girl at the office who has a full head of thick medium length hair, and she really likes it, said even her husband likes it on his super long beard.  So it's a good product, obviously, just have to have the hair for it, which I do not.  Thanks!",0
"As much as I hate to leave a negative review, I have to say I was disappointed.  It's way more a paste than a clay, and it's anything but dry.  I was looking for a replacement for the Alterna Bamboo Form, and I was hoping for exactly a dry clay.  I have thick hair so I need strong control, but I don't want it crunchy, and the wet look is not my jam.  I put this in my hair 3 times now, once dry, and twice barely damp.  Each time, I found the control factor to be about average at best, and it looks and feels very greasy.  Further, when my body temp went up with exercise, it pretty much just melted - no control, EXTRA greasy.  Again, definitely not dry or clay.",0
"Nice product, I'd buy it again!",1
"This smells different and the label print and actual spray bottles are not the same as the bottles I have purchased from local beauty supply shop. Id like to give them the benefit of the doubt and think they reformulated the produce and found different packaging, but I  feel duped.",0
Q. Is Made in China ?,0
"iv been used this for a week, nothing change, the gel inside almost gone, it seems like used not a new, but anyway, i won't buy again.",0
Love it!,1
"It might be good only for straightening, not for curling. Plates are not floating. Cord is not swivel. Holds tiny sections of hair. Gets too hot to operate it with two hands, which is more convenient for curling.",0
"I was skeptical about spending $22 on a stick of deodorant, but this product is well worth the price! Only 3 glides on each under arm and it keeps me smelling great all day. Not too strong, but smells fantastic when you get a whiff of it.",1
Daughter does not like and will not use.,0
Helps but I was expecting a bit more from this product,1
This works great! This especially good during the summer time when you really need to clean your skin but need it to be gentle as well. I tried the higher 10:2 product and I saw no difference.,1
"1: I absolutely never write these, but this was important to say. 2: being an olive skinned person that tans very easily I wanted to try a sunless tanner, so I ordered several to try, since there was very little info from people with darker tones using or writing reviews. 3: results: it turns my nice golden brown skin a grayish brown? Not a good look, BUT it does smell wonderful, comparatively. To get the color I would achieve sitting outside for a few hours without any sunscreen. (Something I haven't done in 10 years), pretty dark, I applied this over another sunless tanning product. However if you are ambiguiously ethnic like me, meaning olive skin. I wouldn't use this product alone, the color is not natural looking at all.
4: Application: I did follow other reviewers reccomendations in application on my hands, feet, knees, and elbows by using leftover creme on the applicator pad and barely wiping it on those areas. No streaking. For my face, I mixed a tiny amount of the sunless tanner with my night moisturizer and applied it that way.",1
LOVE IT,1
"BEST STRIPS EVER! Way better than the Biore, and cheaper.",1
"First time I bought them they were amazing. Second time made me have horrible acne. Don't know if they changed the product, but I will never buy again. Try Peter Thomas Roth it's way better.",0
Broke after a few months .,0
Was excited to try this and it chipped the first day and I wasn't doing anything rough with my hands. Ended up being a waste of money.,0
"It didn't do anything for my rough skin texture and clogged pores. I used it every other day, then once a week. My skin just got drier and rougher. I ended up getting a microdermabrasion at a skin care clinic and it gave me the results I was actually looking for.",0
"Great quality and the same brush my stylist uses. I wanted to get the same look when styling myself, so I bought the same tools the professionals use.",1
works great!,1
"Nice moisturizer, but absolutely no difference in visible lines. As I already have a nice moisturizer that costs a lot less than this one, I won't be buying again!",0
Great product! Use it frequently!,1
Makes my nails bubble,0
Beautiful gradual color!,1
I will stick to the original pomade. This leaves your hair like a helmet,0
"Unfortunately for me this product is not like the authentic Moroccanoil Intense Hydrating Mask products I have used in the past. After one use this product left my hair feeling brittle and dry. And it did not have the scent of authentic morrocanoil products. it smelled more like play-doh. Save yourself time, hair, and money by not purchasing this product.",0
My first razor that I have used for 4 years. I still use this single razor with feather blades and it gives the smoothest shaves with the occasional cuts if I'm in a hurry. If I don't find a particularly pressing reason to replace a product I don't. So I find no reason to replace this one after 4 years.,1
I am very disappointed I spent so much money on this when I but drug store makeup for 1/4 the cost that works better and stays on longer.,0
Love this and its price compared to the expensive curling irons on the market.,1
did nothing for my dark spots.,0
wow this stuff after applied on your hair becomes almost dewy like.  Yuck.,0
Great for wiping baby's face and hands between baths.  Makes him smell really good too!,1
"I have extremely sensitive and reactive skin. I'm a full time student right now and have polymorphic light eruption from the fluorescent lighting. I hate having to wear thick sunscreen, so I thought I'd try this with a light amount of sunscreen and it works wonderfully. It's very moisturizing, not greasy, non-comedogenic, and I don't have an allergy to any of the ingredients.",1
"Eau de Rochas is a really pleasant, light perfume.  I like that it isn't a heavy, sweet scent but is a fresh, citrus and floral type of perfume.  When I first smelled the perfume, I wasn't really impressed with it.  However, once applied it is much more pleasant and complex.  It isn't overpowering and simply smells clean and fresh.  My husband noticed I was wearing a new perfume and commented that he really liked it too.

The bottle itself is quite pretty and looks quite decorative on my dresser.  This would be a great perfume to buy yourself or to give as a gift.",1
"Very disappointing, does not work for me, I have color over white hair, I used it 3 times, it made my hair dry and flat and stripped some of the color.",0
Very helpful in covering up my scars. Easy to wash off with make-up remover. It didn't smudge once applied and I only had to reapply it occasionally throughout the day. Would definitely recommend for those seeking a cover-up make up.,1
"$10 for basically a tiny little sample is absurd. Don't be fooled by the picture, this is a super small tube.",0
Dint work for me.,0
"The only reason why my wife didn't like it was the fact she hated the scents of it , she wears fresh cream by Philosophy. I had to go and buy two. I wanted to return the other one brand new still in packaged untouched, I would gladly buy something else in fresh cream she really wants a small bottle to put in her purse.",0
Excellent for curly or wavy hair.,1
It doesn't build like most mascaras. And it makes my eyes itchey.,0
I like it too.,1
"For the record, I don't have much in the way of a beard. What hair I do have is thick and coarse. As for the product: eh. I am typically a quasi wet-shaver (I lather up with a badger brush and soap, but shave with a Dollar Shave Club razor). I picked some of this stuff up for travel and times when I don't feel like going through the entire badger brush ritual. The product smells nice and feels nice, but I'm really unimpressed with the way it shaves. It gunks up the razor pretty good, I still feel a bit of razor burn, and my shave isn't as close as I'd like. I have both it and the brush available and will always opt for the brush if I have the time and the energy.  Really expensive for the quality of shave it provides. Won't be buying it again.",0
My hair still feels tangled after using it.,0
"Amazing! Fast delivery, and the palette is the best purchase I have ever made :)",1
I have the menthol version of this cream and both are really great. I would highly recommend either shaving cream.,1
I've been using this product for almost a year and I love it.  It spreads nicely on your face and a little goes far.  I ordered the first time through my dermatologist's aesthetics division.  Ordering it through Amazon gives you a better price. This product substitutes the one I was using before which at that time (over 6 mos ago)  was cheaper.  This product  is now more expensive at my dermatologist office.,1
This is the best product!!  It's the only foundation that conceals my dark circles and any other imperfections!  Have used it for years and will continue to recommend it to anyone who needs full coverage.,1
Love this.  Smooth and silky. Great for those fine lines under your eyes.  I would recommend this for anyone who wants to improve the look of fine lines around the eyes.,1
thought it was more like salmon color its kind of rusty not too pretty on,0
I feel this product is a bit heavy.  Might be good for someone with curly hair but for my short style it weighs down easily.,0
Do not buy this product!!!!! It will rip your hair out of your head!!!! Even a professional hairstylist tried to use it and failed miserably.,0
"Full coverage, nothing completely covers age spots but this with Amazing Concealer is the best I've found.",1
"I wanted to try something that minimized my pores. I purchased this and tried it. It made my acne worse, didn't do anything to reduce the size of my pores, and had a heavy, sticky feel. Thank you Amazon for allowing me to return it for a refund. DermaDoctor needs to go back to med school! Try Dr. Brandt's Pore minimizer instead.",0
"OK color. For the price, poor applicator brush. Applies very runny. Worst of all: it chips very easily, almost peeled off my nail. Lasted about 10 hours total before I called it quits and removed it.",0
Wont blow dry on high anymore after 5 months of having it.,0
This balm is nothing like it used to be. I should have heeded the warnings in the other reviews. This balm has no smell or what I consider a bad smell (certainly not sandalwood). The consistency of this balm is also terrible. It's very watery. The old balm smelled great and had a nice thick consistency. Avoid this product.,0
I have used Elemis for a couple of years after trying it on a cruise.  I am very satisfied with the results of this product.  Great seller.,1
"I thought this was the same cleanser I have bought in the past: Epicuren Herbal Cleanser. However it is  ""Citrus"" and much too acidic for the skin on my face. I will find some other use for it or give it away.",0
My Iron has stopped working. Ive used it twice at max and now it woudnt turn on or heat up! Such a shame for something that is so popular I was expecting better. I have had the cortex 4in1 set for over 3 years and still works perfectly.,0
Not really a shellac it didn't give me much shine.,0
I was stupid did not read the amount of product for this price.  Not worth the money,0
"doesn't work on me at all
like the peel type better",0
"I've now tried 3 different polishes and all have chipped by the next day, which really is the same as what a normal polish would do. I've even tried special base coats, and an additional top coat hoping that would help, but had the same results of chipping the next day. It's really disappointing and not what was advertised at all.",0
Great product.  Inadequate packing the caused the container too leak.,0
"The coverage and color was ok, but for $32 for a measely .7 oz, it only lasted me between 2 colors. So, if you're trying to get an extra week out of your hair color to save a few bucks, don't bother with this product because it will end up costing more!",0
Looks nice until it chips off 4 hours later lol,0
"Just way too expensive and already have a finger poking out, because the seam got loose. And have been using it for 2 weeks. Wash is by hand after use with mild soap in the sink and still didn't last long. Other reviews were similar; expensive and won't last a summer.
It's a shame, because I like the self tanner and would think they could put a free one in when you purchase their product.",0
Worked for a year and then bit the dust. My 5 year old revlon from target works better,0
I received an empty bottle. It wasn't even the one pictured. You could tell some liquid had been there cause it was wet within packaging. Disappointed,0
I would give this zero stars. Made my hair grow back worse ! Please trust me I paid 250 of my hard earned cash on this crap ! One word SCAM ! My biggest regret is buying this crap machine,0
"Not as opaque w first coat as Isa, more like jelly type polish. But looks good, not see through w 2 coats. Pretty metallic mid tone magenta. Long wearing",1
COUNTERFEIT,0
GoodFor I can not do without Bmacaiaja daily and evening very wonderful: very distinctive,1
I am very excited to use the product but unfortunately when i tried to plug it in. The pin is uneven. The other one is exactly can fit but the other side is too big. So how am i going to use this thing? Is there any chance you could refund me so i can buy another adaptor? This is an expensive purchase but i won't be able to use it. Take consideration on this matter.,0
I have worked in the dental field for a decade now. This toothbrush is awesome! I highly recommend it for people who have completely natural teeth or people with porcelain crowns. It's gentle and effective!,1
"I ordered this because Ive been having sinus problems and thought it would help. And it does!!  I soak with this in my bath and I haven't had to use vapor rub. Another reason I ordered is because it is a bath oil and not a bubble bath. In my jet tub it does create a small amount of bubbles, but its worked out great.",1
This product is so light abd smells amazing. I put it in my hair and it made it feel so soft yet so moisturized.,1
Works well. I would like a stronger scent it has one and I like just wish it was stronger,1
"Cons: Very heavy
  Leaves your hair frizzy
  button in awkward place

Pros:None, wish I had never bought.",0
"Product is very drying on the delicate under eye area .  Ironic that it's  suppose to be a  anti wrinkle product  , it made my  creases look worse and did nothing to help cover under-eye circles . Would never purchase this item again .
Fast shipping , good service from seller .",0
Highly recommended!!!,1
"The color and consistency were exactly as advertised. It's a very light, sheer pink. Sometimes I wear it alone and sometimes as a gloss over a neutral, beigey matte lipstick to give it a bit more shine. My only negative remark is that it's a slim tube, so it won't last long - a bit pricey.",1
I have dry skin and I use this along with Bioelements Sleepwear before i go to bed.  It's perfect.  It makes the area around my eyes feel soft.  I haven't used it long enough to notice any change in the lines around my eyes.,1
Does not smell like the the real perfume at all. It is just alcohol and smell like nothing!,0
not worth it,0
I would have given this product a 5 star for the first 10 months. Last week I went to turn it out and now only cold air comes out. My cheap conair hair dryer lasted longer than this one.,0
"I absolutely Love this!  I would recommend everyone to try this product, not only is it all natural , but it is extra gentle on  my sensitive skin.  The appearance of my skin  is not only improved ,  but it feels great too!!  All my friends are raving about how beautiful my face looks, after only using it for a week.  The seaweed is super gentle and the cleanser smells amazing.  Everyone should defiantly try this :)<3 You will not be disappointed

Side note:  there are little bits of seaweed throughout so make sure to wash it all down your sink. I wouldn't recommend using this product in the shower, Sink Only!!  <3 Still Love it Rated 5 stars!",1
"Started my de shaving journey with this razor. The finish of the product is good and it does a great job of shaving. However, my personal preference left me asking me more than the short handle this razor has and also the lack of weight.
Great razor to begin with. Very travel and cleaning friendly because of its three piece build.",1
This stuff hardly did its job. I had pink in my hair and it didn't do anything to it. The brown in my hair did lighten from a dark brown to a copper. Left it in for 45 mins and did everything the directions said. THIS STUFF SMELLS LIKE ROTTEN EGGS! That is no joke. The smell is atrocious. I had to wash my hair EIGHT times to get the stench out and it still lingered a bit. Not worth the $30,0
The concept is nice and my wife thought it was good until she realized that 4 or five of the items were for men. I bought one that said it was for women so I was disappointed that she got things like men's Cologne and men's face shaving shaving cream.,0
"This product is old school masculine.  First, it does the job.  The soap does a great job of cleaning and for a small bar doesn't dissolve quickly.  The scent is a cross between old time barbershops and my grandfather's pipe.  I love it.

Interesting side note:  I bought this soap in December.  After I bought it Amazon said the soap would be delivered to me around Jan. 20th.  To my shock it came on exactly Jan. 20th!  I also found out why...It shipped from Europe.",1
I gotta say I am in love with this dry shampoo. I've heard some mixed reviews in the past about dry shampoos but this one has never once failed me. I can go a few days without washes bc of this stuff. What a time savor!!!! Thanks!!,1
Many thanks,1
 turns my blonde PINK! And makes my hair super silky!! Love it for when I want a quick hair change that isn't permanent!,1
"Very pigmented color. A soft mauve that doesn't need a top coat and helps your nails grow. This is something I would buy for my BFF, sister, and niece. I've noticed that I can go 7 days without chipping (I take it off after 7 days so I don't know how much longer it would last) and minimal wear. I can see this being used as a stocking stuffer too. It's fabulous.",1
"This color is not the color I have been using for years. It is labeled as ""Passion"" but not the same color. Very disappointed",0
"I absolutely love this face mist! I use it after cleansing and toning my face, I use this in substitute for moisturizer since I have oily skin and it's worked so well for me! I definitely recommend it!!",1
My son's favorite cologne!,1
"This product has a complex scent that I really enjoy. This is a scent meant for both men and women, and as a person of the male gender, I find the musky undertones to make it plenty masculine for my own wear. Yet, there is enough complexity in the scent that I wouldn't balk if this were worn by my wife. I find that I don't need that much to achieve the subtle effect I'm going for, and that means I've eschewed the sprayer in favor or just dabbing some using my hand. At the rate I'm currently using it, I expect this relatively small bottle to last many months. You'll have to make your own decision regarding value, as this certainly doesn't rate as an inexpensive scent, but it is dynamic and deep and I really like it. As a somewhat unuseful but potentially helpful-to-some aside, my wife is quite sensitive to many ""sharp"" and artificial odors (such as many perfumes, car scents, etc.) but this hasn't bothered her at all.",1
Niece loved it - but quit working after 5 months.,0
For someone that knows and like it a lot as she uses it for treating her dificult hair gets nice,1
I had to give it away. My hair just didn't feel right after using this shampoo.,0
Pureology changed its formula. Dry hair!,0
"I unfortunately saw the hype around this product and fell for it. My favorite glam gurus used it and loved it. They spoke so highly of this product. But when I bought it and used it the first time, it was nice. But its been almost 2 weeks(i know, I really wanted to make this product work for me ) and my face is breaking out, and it doesnt break out. Im breaking out on places on my face that I never break out on, my skin is itchy and dry and really irritated. I slowly introduced this to my skin care routine. I even thought that at one point maybe the ingredients in my regular routine just don't work with this. I had patience and  utilized the internet to see what I could do. And alas nothing helpful, and nothing good and my face got worse. I would like to make it clear that I do not have sensitive skin. Do your research about this brand before buying. Just because it failed for me, doesnt mean itll fail for you. But to be fair I have it a chance I really tried but this brand failed. The ingredients are the best quality of what they could be. And I just don't trust it. You can buy something much for gentler and kinder to your face for cheap, do not use this.",0
i love this it is more of a day fragrance butlove the smell would wear all the time will purchase more,1
Works great for everyday styles.,1
Love the color and the quality of Essie.  Dark blue/navy is pretty in as a color this year so I plan on wearing this polish a lot.,1
I am forced to select a star but I personally would give none. Package was not sealed when I received it. The last two times I have ordered this shampoo from this distributor it has been a slow process into making me bold. I have lost tons of hair and now I have a really bad case of dandruff on top of extremely dry hair.,0
"Heavy fragrance, not nearly as expected. Hoped for almond fragrance, none to be found. Sent this product back due to fragrance.",0
Smells great!,1
I read the other reviews and thought I would like this but wasn't too impressed.  Anyone buying perfume should definitely smell it first.,0
"Babyliss products are great, but unfortunately I don't think the product I got was a real Babyliss. It seemed to be a bootleg version, with cheap plastic handles that get really hot to the touch, and a cheap looking logo stuck on the side.  The box didn't look very official either.  The iron itself is not that great, it gets so hot to the touch I can barely hold it!  I would beware",0
"It's okay, I did like how easily it went on, nice thin line. But, it didn't last all day... not for me. Not like everyone said in the reviews.",0
"The fragrance is ridiculously overwhelming.  My eyes watered immediately, and my sinuses and throat began to swell within a couple of minutes.  I had to pull my hair back away from my face/nose until I had a chance to wash it later.  What a waste of $20.",0
Awesome!,1
"I had owned a CHI curling iron for the past 5 years. Never had a problem with it.  I decided to get a new ceramic barrel one and purchased this item.  It lasted less than 4 months before the spring went out on it.  I was out of the 30 day warranty period with Amazon so I contacted CHI/Farouk.  I was told by the CHI/Farouk representative that they do not warranty any item purchased on-line which was clearly printed in the instruction manual.  I would not know that the warranty was void for on-line purchases until I actually received the item in my home and read the operating manual cover to cover.

I will not purchase another CHI product, on-line or in a retail store.",0
"All
Time favorite hair spray at the perfect price! Paid palmist $20 at the salon and only $11 on Amazon! I'll take that savings any day!",1
"I do love this. I usually use a HAI flat iron, but I thought it was cool that you can set the temp and that it heats up SUPER fast and SUPER hot. I still also recommend the HAI...",1
"This is the best smelling perfume, it is light and sweet and not floral at all.  I love it.",1
"I have used this product for at least a year.  I loved it at first, but now I am not using it that much. I would almost give it a FIVE star rating since it works as advertised. However, nothing is perfect, and this product has some inevitable cons.  I would summarize the pros and cons to make this section simple. However, overall I was VERY IMPRESSED with this product!

Pros:

- If you still have a few hairs on top (and not completely bald), you can sprinkle this on and it will miraculously make it look like you have hair. Follow it with the spray so it does not blow all over the place (although static holds it well but not if you are moving much too fast)
- 2 minutes sprinkle followed by two squirts of spray, and you're done! (EASY PREP)
- It look so real, and many people were shocked when the saw me (and/or saw pictures)
- with the toppik spray, it was surprisingly not a bit affected from the winds during my rides on several roller coasters.
- does NOT blow away in a convertible
- It can withstand a light touch but not rubbing (others touching it will feel that you have spray as in crusty feel, but will not know you have fake hair)
- lots of colors to choose from. Color matching is almost perfect.

Cons:

- You do not want to be caught in the rain (unless you are planing for an interesting halloween costume)
- Understandably it will wash away with shampoo (actually that is amongst the PROs)
- It will partly come off during sleep. You can re-apply (it would not take a whole lot as it did the first time), however, it will end up on your pillow; which you can of course shake off, and eventually wash. HOWEVER: I did not like having to worry about breathing it in.  It is probably not a major concern since there is not a whole lot on the pillow, but the little fibers somehow managed to make their way into my eyes and behind my contacts, hence in my contact lens case... May be I am an aggressive sleeper, but I did not like that aspect. So I started showering it off every night, however, this can get a bit expensive since you will go thorough a lot of product. You also have to understand the initial shock of seeing that thinning hair after showering it off, which will inevitably make you think that you have less than you had before using the product. Plus, I do not generally want to shower with shampoo products on a daily basis. So I opted to use this product sparingly... however, much to the confusion of everyone around me: Does he or Does he Not have hair; that was the question. So I stopped!
- If you are with someone, and they decide to play with your hair, you will get unnaturally uneasy about it! This may detract from the entire confidence look that toppik helped you build in the first place. This may be a great product for first, second, or third dates (depending how fast you usually advance, however, once you get literally closer such that you opted to not use it that day, if your date is the observant-type, they may suddenly wonder: how did I all of a sudden make him lose his hair :*(  )
- ADVISE: do not wear it if you are going to the dentist.  I made this mistake once. The dental hygienist was 8 months pregnant. My head was lowered somehow to the level of her unborn little one (who, although, may also not have had any hair yet, unlike me they did not need my toppik application). Although I did not mind her pregnant tummy rubbing against my head, it was not until she was done with my cleaning that I had this huge embarrassment look on my face seeing a round black unexplainable dust on her white lab coat. I unintentionally started to brush it off, as she said: ""I know my tummy is getting big... omg what is that... where did it come from!"" So I had to explain the whole bit.
- Do not wear it when you go to the eye doctor
- If you are the hardcore working out-type in the gym, I would be cautious from sweat and from losing portions on the workout matts
- Unlike the ads, I was not able to comb comfortably without making it look worse
- Although the ad suggests you may use it for front baldness, I found it to be difficult to use that way.

SUMMARY: If you want to look like you do not have a balding/thinning area on top (say you are getting photos taken all around you), this product would be perfect.",1
"Didnt know this product contains the toxin, paraben. Cancer is not something I want to promote on my skin (check out
http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/company/Tantowel_Int%27l_Pty._Ltd./products/ ) or  google the Skin Deep website to get the exact diseases that different ingredients cause. For the price of these towels, they should not have ingredients that cause cancer or cause hormone disorders.
On a plus (but still not worth cancer), they did tan fast BUT it looks awful two weeks later as it's orange splotches on my wrists and neck-not a pretty sight.
Anyone know of a tan product that has 'clean'  ingredients? Please let me know, seriously, as I like the idea of a tan without the use of an 'skin aging' tanning-bed completely but do not want to line the pockets of companies that have no problems using toxic ingredients.
Thanks for any help!

Edited because there was a big weird typo that was from my iPad autocorrecting!",0
After 3 weeks i really haven't noticed any difference. It actually seems to be drying. Perhaps using just the honey with bee venom would be more moisturizing,0
"THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT TO RID HAIR OF THE MINERALS IN WATER THAT RUIN HAIR.  BUT - IT SMELLS AWFUL.  I WISH THEY'D MAKE IT MORE FRAGRANT.  OTHER THAN THAT, IT DOES WORK WELL AND LEFT MY HAIR SOFT & PRETTY BUT ONLY IF I USED MY FAVORITE SHAMPOO AFTERWARD OR BETTER STILL, WITH THE PURIFY.  A TINY AMOUNT OF PURIFY PLUS REGULAR SQUIRT OF OTHER SHAMPOO IS THE TICKET.",1
"It works to create volume and enhance my daughters curls, but it won't stay on my Babyliss Nano Titanium Pro Portofino Hair Dryer. When it falls off my daughter gets burned. I wish it would stay on and it would be a 5/5 or 10/10...It's almost pointless if it doesn't stay on.",0
"As someone else already commented, this polish color chips off after ONE DAY! I went back to Ulta to ask for tips, and the girls there suggested using alcohol prior to application to ensure the nail was dry. They suggested waiting plenty of time to let it dry between coats. I have tried this polish multiple times following all the steps and using all of the three infinite shine layer steps. Something is wrong with this color formula--for me anyhow. I have other colors in the ""infinite shine"" collection that don't have this problem.",0
Seems to be a knock off.  Does not get as hot as it should,0
"I got this for my wife but please understand that she absolutely does not need it!  I am surprised to say that this actually works.  As other reviewers have suggested, we tried this on one half of her face to do a side by side comparison.  The results are impressive but not permanent.  We are thinking of trying a cheaper aloe vera gel.",1
"The lotion comes out of the bottle way too fast and is very wet.  I have loved Coola products in the past and am disappointed that this was not as good as the others, especially given the price point.",0
"If you're trying to cover up frontal thinning this will not work. It doesn't bind to hairs like it says it does, it goes on your scalp like dark powder.  It looks way worse than the natural look - actual very comical.

This might work to some extent for light crown balding.",0
"Looks pretty, pink, and creamy with strawberry seeds as described.  Expected a lovely strawberry smell, but just smelled like lotion.  Also felt like a cream lotion.  Did nothing at all.  Followed up with my clean and clear scrub to get the job done.",0
To do all over again WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT.  Is it suppose to do anything but spray your face because you can do that with cool water & save $$,0
"Love, love, love this product. It is easy to apply and covers grey well.",1
The product arrived with a broken cover and scratch and dust on the bottle. It makes doubt if it is a fake Evian facial spray.,0
"I've been using Art of Shaving for quite some time. I use to be in the Army and as you may or may not know you have to have a clean face. What does that mean? You're having to shave at least 3-4 times a week, depending on how quickly your hair grows. My hair grows pretty quickly so I found myself shaving 4 times week. This caused me to get ingrown hairs on my face, mostly my neck. I started to look for solutions but there weren't very many. Most of them wanted to me use tweezers to pull out all the ingrown hairs. I don't know about you but, I don't have time to do that. This is where The Art Of Shaving came into play. I found them while looking through a men's magazine(couldn't tell you which one). I ordered the starter pack which was pre-shave oil, badger brush, shaving cream, and after shave lotion. I started out with their lemon scent(I'm a sucker for citrus scents). I loved it and I used it for quite some time. That's until they came out with their Ocean Kelp scent. I wanted to try something new with them and decided to give this scent a try. This is a refreshing scent and it doesn't stick around if you find yourself putting on other stuff on your face such as cologne or body spray. The aftershave lotion with Art of Shaving doesn't contain alcohol so you don't get a burn when putting it on and it doesn't dry out your face. I recommend using The Art of Shaving not just cause of it's name but because the products work when used correctly.",1
useful,1
"I got this for my mom for Christmas. It looks/works FANTASTIC, until you touch it. AND I even bought the hair spray to go over it. I simply touched her scalp lightly with my finger and it left a scalp-colored finger print. It immediately turns into a paint like consistency when it mixes with any natural hair/scalp oils. It gets cakey and clumpy as well. On the hair strands themselves it looks great, but its pointless if you want to cover bald spots.",0
"Go to highlighter, even though its advertised as an eyeshadow. It's gorgeous as both, but a bit more shimmery than I originally thought it would be. The shimmer is beautiful and subtle, however, I'm just more of a natural style gal.",1
"If it were possible, I'd rate these sheets zero stars. They're easily the worst purchase I ever made on Amazon. Although they look nice and feel soft, they are very thin and poorly made. The seams  on the pillowcase have unraveled and there are snags and holes starting after only a handful of uses. Absolutely HORRIBLE quality.",0
This is very fragrant and smells like soap. I will not use it on my toddler.,0
Nothing to rave about.,0
"It looks like the real fragrance BUT it did not last. I wonder whether it was a reject or something.

t",0
Leaves my hair crispy. Would not repurchase,0
"Never bothered to use it,.",0
I have heard for years  how great this product is and finally purchased it. Wish I would have done it sooner. What a help to my daughters skin. Fast and professional service.,1
"Too matte for me... made my fine wrinkles stand more than usual (in other words, did more bad than good)...",0
"These clippers are quite handy and kind of exotic.  They fold up incredibly flat, and have a very nice leather pouch to store them.  I use these in my travel kit as they are the most compact set I've ever run across.  It took me a second to figure them out when I first unfolded them-- you have to make several moves to get them aligned before they're ready to use.  Once you do it the first time, it's never, ever a hassle again.  I would totally buy these again to put into my travel kit.  My clippers did not include the ceramic file, so I can't speak to that item's value.",1
Not impressed at all. A regular eyelash curler heated with a hair drying or on a curling iron works much much better for me.,0
Good product.,1
"OH MY GOD!!! when i received in mail, i was so happy because the color in the bottle was so gorgeous, even though i thought it would be a little lighter than that.
Here are my quick outline:

PROS:

1) Gorgeous peachy pink color, and depending on the light, will look neon orange, which gives the color so much variety that you never get sick of it.

2) Dries so quick despite its opaque-ness!!!!!!!! i've never seen such a thick polish dry so fast and HARD!!!!

3) So perfectly glossy that you don't even need a topcoat

4) Lasts longer than cheaper polishes even without a topcoat

5) Odor is not as strong as other polishes! it's very faint. i guess the non-toxicness has to do with this?

CONS:

1) Brush is too harsh: the first coat will have ugly brush marks, although the second coat covers them perfectly and evenly

2) Bottle is too SMALL!!!

3) the handle of the brush is too short and tiny

4) For most skin types, will make your skin look uglier (makes my asian skin tone look so tanned!!) since it is such a bright, almost neon color

OVERALL, the pros beats the cons and will buy other colors as well. I think i am going to put up a picture, so please take a look at that too!!!!",1
"Scam! Completely watered down whatever that was. I had some left in my old bottle and it was not even the same color, texture or smell. I also shouldve listened to the reviews!",0
"Only able to get 10 face washings before the battery dies. It lasted one week MAX. I had the original Clarisonic and it would last 2 weeks b4 a charge was needed. The original Clarisonic was WAY better, worked perfectly for 2+ yrs. The Clarisonic Mia2 is not nearly as good as the original!! So sad.",0
it was too hard for me to wrap my hair around the wand without burning my scalp. i think it would work better for longer hair.,0
"Want to return but window closed. Opened, weeks after buying when my prior can ran out. Only half full. That's a lot missing for $32 for just 2 oz. I've purchased many cans of this and don't feel this one is authentic. Different, darker color and stiffer texture. Disappointed. Contact me to make right please.",0
"Loved this blow dryer until the past few weeks! The switch is acting up. It shuts off during blow drying or you can't turn it on when  you slide the switch.  It cuts out.  Starts and then stops.  I have it all packaged up to ship back because it's under warranty but it's going to cost me $13.50 to ship it back plus the manufacturer wants $3 to cover shipping it back to me!  What!! They are making a faulty product...it should be free!  According to other reviews, people who have shipped it back, received a new blow dryer in its place only to have the exact same thing happen again with the replacement.

Not sure it's worth my time or the extra money.

Very, very disappointed!",0
"The Masque leaves my severely damaged hair feeling smooth and silky. I use it every other day (that's how bad my hair is). I totally  recommend this product for people with all types of hair. My sister, who has never colored or chemically treated her hair, uses it once a week and it helps her hair keep it's natural shine.",1
It smells exactly like rose water! The worst purchase ever and I cant even return it :(,0
great summer color,1
"I got this for my boyfriend a few months ago since it was at an amazing price, shipping was supposed to take over a week but it came in 2 days! Not to mention I didn't know what this smelled like at all and he and I both love it! This was a wonderful purchase on my end",1
Not as good as the true burberry,0
Products my wife has never heard of. Maybe free but not worth the shipping charge.,0
"Terrible soap!  Does NOT lather whatsoever with a brush.  Enough said Don't bother.
On the other hand, it does smell excellent so it is a nice shower soap.",0
Terrible. I paid 25.00 for an opener bottle that had barely anything in it.,0
"I was hoping this was the replacement for the old Philosophy Razor Sharp. It is not. It does have a nice, clean scent. But, it does not have the same skin lubricating properties as the old razor sharp. Had I known that this was a totally different formulation, I would never have paid $20 for this product. I was very disappointed.",0
"I have to remind myself that this is the travel size when I'm using it.  Great size to toss is a bag but it's very easy to get your hand too close to the plates when using.  Overall, no complaints.  I would definitely recommend this product.",1
"Dry and flakey, love this brand, just will order from QVC",0
the container arrived with at least an inch at the top of no product. what the hell? I paid $24 dollars for this 3/4 full container of hair goo?,0
I purchased this brush to go along with the Bio Ionic Power Light Pro Dryer.  The dryer recommended it.  I do not like it.  I typically do not like round brushes I find the teeth are always too short to hold my hair smooth for drying. I have thick curly hair.  This one is slightly better than a round one but you need to be careful that you don't leave it in one place too long because then you end up with a line in your hair from the corner of the brush.  I personally like to us an oval brush.  BTW the dryer I purchased along with this brush is awful and I can't return it.,0
Maybe 4.5  Greatly improved neck firmness,1
"I think I must have gotten the new formula, as it didn't do anything beneficial to my skin. I bought it because of the great reviews, but after reading the most recent reviews, the description of the new formula matches what I have in the bottle.",0
I was very happy using this product.  The special system they have just doesn't work.  I think I have to use a hammer also.  What a shame!!!,0
This does not work like it did in the salon. Possibly old.,0
excellant! doesn't feels greasy,1
Love this product,1
"Likes:  Product arrived on-time, and as described.  For this product, goals were lowest price point while obtaining a legitimate product.  This appears to meet both goals:  competitive pricing for real product.  It definitely cost less than at local retailers in my area (Austin, TX metro).

Yikes!  No yikes.  With sunscreen, unless one suffers a burn, it's difficult to tell if it's working.",1
Color is like cotton candy pink. Matte and long-lasting. Tastes like candy.,1
"I knew it would not be successful when reading the first ingredient was water.  It did not work for my dry, frizzy hair.",0
Not only did this take a week longer than stated to receive but it smelled watered down with alcohol!  The old bottle that I bought at Macy's wasn't totally empty and it was much more potent and aromatic!  Very disappointing but I'd already wasted the money on it!,0
Cleans so thoroughly! I love it & use this daily,1
This really does disguise thinning hair.  I am a female with thin hair due to medication.  this keeps my part from looking too wide.  Looks normal/natural.,1
"I was using an old dried up mascara to achieve the same look that this gives. I would recommend doing one eyebrow at a time as this dries quickly, and if you make a mistake, it is difficult to correct. You need a very light touch when applying, but overall it gives a natural brow look when you have light or sparse eyebrow hairs. Is it better than the dried up mascara? The mascara is definitely cheaper, but it is hard to find any in brown. I haven't been using this for very  long, so I don't know how long a tube will last. This is a little expensive and the length of time it lasts will be the determining factor as to whether I will buy it again. Overall I am happy with the results.",1
Scratchy consistency! I WISH I could return it,0
"After reading such awesome reviews about this pricey product, I decided to purchase this for my hubby. Big mistake! This is my first time ever giving a product a one star review. To put it into simple terms, it did not work.",0
Perfect hair product.,1
I keep it in the refrigerator so I love the cool feeling of the roller on my under eyes.  Not quite sure if it's making a difference on my under eye skin though..,1
I used the product as directed for a month but no changes,0
Great iron! Very professional.,1
"I don't have flakes.  I just accidentally bought this shampoo along with other Philip B products on MYHABIT.com and loved it.  I used it up and bought this on Amazon to replenish.  The price is much higher here on Amazon compared with MYHABIT but I have to have it.  I don't know if it reduces flakes but I do know it makes my hair smooth and flowy ---I have normal, fine hair which tends to fly away terribly with statics in fall and winter.  My scalp is easily allergic to unknown substances in many shampoos, but I have no problem with this one.  I love how my scalp feel after this shampoo ---- simply what a healthy scalp should feel all the time, not greasy nor itchy nor dry.  I hope it still does the same thing with my hair and scalp after a long term use.  Some shampoos astonish you with amazing results at the beginning then disappoint after a few months of use.  We'll see.",1
The fragrance was not right for me.  The vendor that sold it refused to take it back.  Would not use again.  Does not stand by their product.,0
"I have light-to-medium hair. Would have thought medium color would match --- need much darker. This looks more like what I'd expect a blonde to wear who had naturally blonde eyebrows.

would not order this color again.",0
Gives great volume to hair without much body!,1
"I prefer it deposited more color.  I have dark brown hair lightened to an auburn with additional highlights.  This keeps my highlights slightly coppery without becoming brassy.  Really, the best part of this is that the conditioner is actually great and has a nice smell.  Most of these conditioners are good at color but terrible at conditioning.  My hair stays smooth and shiny without being weight down.  Love it.",1
Love this shampoo and conditioner,1
love it! seems a bit expensive for what it is but still a good product. also it was delivered same day with amazon same day prime.,1
I like this product it lathers up to a great puck no razor burn yet,1
"I love this product.. Even on warm days when and just out of the shower the product is so cool to your skin. I have noticed how fast blemishes heal faster when I started using this. I hope to see an improvement in skin texture after using the container if so I will continue using this item. I am over 50 and need all the help I can get after Breast cancer with cemotheraphy and radation that seemed to drain all the life of my complexion.

So far this has worked for me.",1
Received with damaged,0
I hate the product.,0
I love it,1
"Great product! Worth the money - makes hair silky smooth for course, dry hair.",1
This is a great product. Covers my shinny bald head perfectly.,1
"Terrific flat iron.  I tried both curly and straight hair styles with it.  Usually my hair is somewhat dry after styling.  The vapor really helps.  It's very simple.  You fill the cartridge, plug the iron in,  put it on the heat and vapor setting you want,  wait about 3 min. I was afraid the cartridge would leak,  but so far so good.  I like that it comes with a spare regardless.

My only quibble is the price of the refill oil.  20 bucks.  It only lasts about ten uses so depending on how often you style your hair,  you could spend 40 a month on oil.

***Edit*** I've nearly used the first bottle of oil. My initial cartridge is already leaking, and not where you'd expect it to, not where the oil goes in, but along the side of the cartridge. Further inspection shows there is a crack in the plastic, on the side that faces the iron. This iron has not been dropped or mishandled, so there is no reason for the crack. I could merely start using another cartridge, which was included, but I don't want to spend 20 bucks on oil that's going to end up all over my hands before I've even used the bottle.",0
Disappointed :( it only seemed to make me break out more after using it. But it is very light and creamy and dries quickly so I think it may be good for people with oily skin but mine is dry and sensitive,0
"Not worth the money at all. Barely any color, and wears off in a short time. Plus the packaging was awful! The finish on the tube chipped off, and the top of the tube came unglued. I've never even had this happen with the cheapest drugstore makeup. Epic fail.",0
"If you FOLLOW DIRECTIONS,  it works perfectly for whiteheads,  at least for me.  Does not work on the occasional cystic acne that I get. But it DOES only say whiteheads on the bottle.",1
"Worst tanner I have EVER used. Streaky mess!
I have used many self-tanners over many years and this is by far the worst!",0
These are the best candles I have ever purchased.  The smell lingers for hours and the candle last a long time.  Love the Stonehenge scent.,1
I like the color but the consistency is a fail for me.  I much prefer the consistency of OPI and should have stuck with them.  Feel like I wasted my money for one pedicure. Had the consistency of a wet n wild polish YUCK.,0
"The Elta sunscreen products were recommended by my dermatologist.  I chose this tinted one because I was hoping for a tiny bit of coverage to help even out my skin tone.  Instead it went on practically clear and very shiny. I also wanted some sunscreen protection for the delicate eye area.  I could not use this anywhere near my eyes because it burned like crazy and I had to wash it off after about 10 minutes.  I tired it a second time and the same thing happened. Also I was disappointed when I read in the instructions that for it to be effective for sunscreen protection you need to reapply it every two hours.  It was not that expensive, but it was a waste of money for me.",0
"I LOVE this shampoo......especially now that it's ""turn on the heat"" time in Western New York. I picked it up for $9.99 @ Marshall's here at obviously a great price. Actually, I originally bought the bottle a while back. As a former professional, I'm familiar with the high quality of Rusk products. And, for the price, it was a better deal than I would get at a professional hair supply shop. I decided to try it. I was not crazy about it at that time, most likely because it was warm weather, and it was too moist/nourishing for my fine hair.....I'm not a conditioner user - don't need it. However, I decided to try it again now due to all the static electricity, and dryness/itchy scalp as a result of turning on the furnace. WOW, what a difference, it CURED my issues! No more static, no more itchiness, and my hair is shiny with TONS OF BODY....NO WEIGHING DOWN! I went over to Marshall's yesterday, thinking to myself....""yeah, now that I love a product, I won't be able to get more"".  However, my lucky day, the were just rolling a cart in with 2 bottles on top!!!!! Plus, going forward, it's good to know it can be purchased from specific stores via Amazon.... albeit for more $$$. So, the bottom line is, it's a great product, especially good if you have dry, limp hair.....especially during Fall/Wintertime. BTW, it has a nice sunflower/apricot scent as well.",1
Started using it in May 2017...loved it...after a year it won't heat up?,0
Happy I purchased this mud mask. It's smells great and very strong at getting the impurities out. My face feels so refreshed afterwards.,1
"This sunblock is SO good. I only applied this product twice during a very long day in the sun and I wasn't burned at all.  However, I did wear a big floppy hat also.",1
Very nice,1
I use a Stila bronzer as a blusher so I was sure I would like this. I do like it but it does give a very matte finish (at least on my skin). I have very fair skin but this may be a bit too pale even for me. I will gladly  use this until I find the perfect product for my skin color and type.,1
Smell isn't as nice as I was hoping for but it is a richer feel which is nice.,1
Good product. Scent need to get use to. No safe for color treated hair.,1
"Very nice quality lip gloss! Glides on beautifully and evenly, doesn't feel too sticky or goopy. It feels slightly moisturizing; after it's been on a while, there is a slight tackiness to the texture (just enough to let me know it's still there) but mostly my lips feel soft and healthy. It also doesn't leave a residue, as some glosses do on me - after wearing & reapplying all day, sometimes other glosses leave a thin line of leftover goop around the middle of my lips, but this Julep kind does not do that at all. The sponge-tip wand applicator is my favorite type of lip gloss, and the container has a clean, classy look to it (clear with a black twist-off top for the applicator). It's a rectangular shape rather than a cylinder, a bonus if your lip glosses tend to roll off the bathroom counter.

The color looks like a light-but-rich pearl mauve in the container, but when applied it seems to appear lighter on me. It's almost TOO natural; it has a slightly pretty pearl sheen, but really it barely shows at all. I'm not deducting any stars for the color, because that's really a personal preference - some people prefer a very natural look. I like my lips dark and dramatic, but that's just me!

I have two minor problems with it that are making me give it 4 stars instead of 5 (and they're really minor; I would give it 4-1/2 stars if I could). The first is the pigmenting - it's really very very light. At first I wasn't sure because it's so close to my skin tone, but I tried wearing it over some of my dark, long-wearing matte lipcolor, and it still just barely provided a pearly sheen with almost no color. It's pretty, don't get me wrong, but the color in the tube is so lovely that it's disappointing to be unable to see it at all on my lips. The other thing I'm not impressed with is the longevity. It doesn't advertise itself to be long-wearing, which is fine, but it doesn't seem to last as long as regular-wearing gloss either.

I have a huge weakness for all kinds of lip color products, but I especially love all kinds of sponge-tip glosses like this one. I have tried sooooo many brands, mostly high-end, and I would say that this feels like a very good quality high-end product as well. I have never tried Julep before, and I would definitely buy it again - I'd look for more pigment and a darker shade, but I think it's a great lip gloss overall & I'm very happy with how my lips feel when I wear it.",1
"HI IT""S sticky. Not sure how old it is.. But it feels sticky .. tacky..
Thanks
I would return it... And I just might.
M",0
Works great.,1
I really wanted to like this eyeliner! It was OK-ish but didn't draw easily on the eye. Needed a lot of blending but I liked the color so I works with it....until it needed to be sharpened. Once I had to sharpen it the lead kept breaking and the pencil is made of a plasticky wood so it wouldn't sharpen easy. I ended up breaking the lead 3 times and then chucked it in the trash. Don't bother.,0
"I so badly wanted to like this polish.  I am all about wearing pink in October, so I jumped all over this when Cut & Blow offered a good deal on it and its companion polish, Pink Works.  Imagine my disappointment when I tried to wear it last week.  This might be the worst formula polish I have EVER worked with.  Sheer but patchy, lots of dragging, and even after three thin, even (well, as even as I could manage), there were still unevenly-colored spots on my nails.  Such a disappointment.  If you're looking for a pretty pale pink shade - KEEP LOOKING!!",0
"This product is not the original theBalm palette. I am not satisfied with this purchase. The colors are slightly off from the original, and the quality of the product is poor; the pigment of the color is not true to the palette. The packaging was slightly damaged as well. I want to return this.",0
"It's interesting how perfume will smell differently on people because of their body chemistry, my first impression was that it's your typical floral perfume but after spraying on my skin the scent changed a little and I could also smell a hint of citrus along with a touch of vanilla and musk. It also seems to be pretty long lasting, after washing it off with soap and water I can still smell the fragrance. Floral scents aren't my favorite but I'm sure that my mom who loves them will go crazy for this scent.",1
This product does seem to improve my overall skin appearance. I will continue using especially because I previously didn't have a good skin care regimen.,1
The smell gives me a headache and makes me nauseous.,0
"The smell is awful and it doesn't go away.  It smells like harsh chemicals, and I think I have a bit of allergic reaction to it as well, since my nose was runny after the two or three times I used this.  It's too bad, because otherwise it does a decent job.",0
Love the blank canvas.  Its not too thick and doesn't cause irritation.  Good quality.,1
"Great easy to use product. I tend to use more of the darker color, but the product is really easy to blend and very lightweight.",1
"The product seems pretty. But it came completely crumbled into dust. I can still apply the dust I guess,  but it's a powdery mess.  I was going to put it in my makeup bag but if it accidentally opens I would end up with 26 dollars worth of pink dust everywhere.",0
"Do not be deceived by this 3 in 1 versatile eyeliner. Yes, it provides a natural shimmer for daytime looks, can be used as a highlighter on the lower rim of the eyes (to make them look bigger) and/or in the inner corners of the eyes BUT it will dry out. The formula is very creamy at first and the little sharpener is very handy but I had to toss it after some time because it completely dried out on me! A Maybelline eyeliner I've had for much longer is still creamy. For the price, I was not very pleased with this pencil. I expected better quality. If you don't mind paying so much for a combo pencil then be my guest, but I'd recommend getting a similar product at half the price.",0
"I have long but fine, very fine hair..I had high hopes that this would be for me, not the case, it weighed my hair down with just two sprays! It made my hair greasy, limp and stringy. For a product that has w8less in the name, I am disappointed.",0
"it is not user friendly, when spraying it will not catch air and quit working until you untwist cap to let air in again",0
"I expect soaps to have some lather, but this just seemed to kind of disappear when I rubbed my hands together to work up a lather.  I found it best to pump the soap onto my hands, then rub onto my skin without trying to make a lather.  I think this body wash still got me clean, but it was weird to not see any lathering.  The scent is a bit on the feminine-side as it has a light floral smell.  Not unappealing or lingering, but definitely noticeable.",0
Does nothing,0
"Still Hair loss, no hair growth. I am using entire system 3 kit from last 3 months. In my view no use",0
"I like the color since I work in a hospita as a Chaplain,l it is less noticeable.",1
"Love the perfume, but it has a terrible dispenser. When I opened the package, the rollerball was stuck in the cap. I pried it out and placed it in it's housing. When I apply the perfume, the housing scrapes my neck. I attempted to exchange it only to find that perfumes cannot be sent back!!!",0
"This is my favorite dry shampoo hands down. I have thin hair and anything with any kind of hold or texture makes my hair feel yucky, especially if I don't wash it for a day! I found most dry shampoos that I tried felt like hairspray, sticky, or had a lot of ""hold""  - didn't like them at all. My hair felt like it had a birds nest texture by the end of the day. The Amika dry shampoo seems to really do what it is suppose to do - make my hair feel clean, not sticky, weighed down, or with a hair spray smell. It has a pleasant fragrance (I've gotten complimented on it - I don't wear perfume). Does it feel like i just washed it - no, but it is enough to get me through a day without shampoo and make my hair stylist happy that I am not washing every day.",1
Hate the fat brush.,0
"Beautiful color of red, very vibrant. It's not pinkish or purple under toned. Long lasting quality brand.",1
My son's go to hair product!  AAA+++++,1
"While it looks like a full sized eye pencil, it's not. It's not a pencil, it can't be sharpened- but it's also not adjustable either. As far as I can figure, the little tiny nub on the end is all you get, and if that becomes dull, you'll either have to use a brush, or you're SOL.
Seems to crease a lot. It's gel, so I surely didn't expect smudge proof, but I'm just not at all impressed.",0
Smells so good! So moisturizing. I love this stuff!!!,1
"I didn't really notice a difference in my nails or hair, but my skin broke out in a horrible allergic reaction. I have sensitive skin, but I have never experienced a breakout like I did after taking these vitamins.",0
Great hand cream!,1
Used it a few times by the 3 or 4th time it was reading wrong.,0
"Absolutely the best stuff I've found to make my hair soft and smooth.  I use this in place of a regular conditioner.  After many years of use, I still love this stuff.",1
"I sent this Clarisonic Mia 1 Facial Sonic Cleanser as a gift for my wonderful Sister-In-Law. A trial-sized cleanser was SUPPOSED to be included in the box, I did not send her any cleanser separately. Imagine my embarrassment when I learned that the cleanser was not in the box. Thus, she won't be able to use it until I can order cleanser and then send it to her!! That is why I have given this product two stars, even though I don't have any idea how it will work. I did try to have a replacement trial cleanser sent to her, but the only available option was to have her send the entire unit back. I did not want to ask her to do that. There should be an option to replace a missing part, especially when it is so simple as in this situation.
As I consider myself a good amazon customer, I am hoping this review or the next one I write concerning this problem will be easily resolved.
In the meantime, I did order the cleanser to be sent to her.",0
Awesome product. I love it!,1
"This is a non-greasy alternative to standard gel, it is very thick, but stays in the hair all day, providing no flaking.",1
"Another translucent  make you face better,that this one .no big deal. I waste my money.you can buy un drug stores like maybelline or Almay ,same efect",0
"After reading all the reviews on this fragrance I cold not wait to try it. Unfortunately I must disagree with most of the reviews. I can only explain this as it must smell different on different people due to body chemistry. On me it smelled old fashioned like something my grandma would wear. It is sweet, and powdery, and not at all spicy. As they day goes on the scent fades into something that reminds me of that old cheap bath powder I got for Christmas as a kid. You know the one in the pink plastic container with the big fluffy powder puff? By days end I could not wait to wash it off. I would definitely test this and not buy based on reviews only. The most positive thing I can say about it is the bottle is very cute!!",0
"The brush is listed as Boar Bristle, but the item that arrived has Nylon Bristles.  I'm disappointed in the product as it was expensive and incorrectly labelled.",0
"Wen Mousse is light, but gives my thick hair just the right amount of hold.
I would recommend it.",1
Just tried this since we love the conditioner so much and it's really nice.  Great smell.,1
It is more of a freezing spray than a volumizing spray..  It glues your hair and you can not brush through it after you spray.,0
"i love juicy!! i have a lot of tees, bags, jewelry, and sweatsuits!! and when i found out that pam and gela came out with a new juicy perfume, i was ecstatic!! it smells sooo glam; mostly floral, like flowers, roses, and vanilla cream. it lasts forever. i got a sample at bloomingdale's and i sprayed it on everyday for a week and it lasted the whole day. it's not too strong and it's very girly and pretty! it even comes with a necklace that doubles as a charm for the gorgeous bottle. i strongly recommend it!!",1
Did not see a difference in color.,0
Good product.  I dropped 1 star because it comes out very powerfully and feels like I'm wasting some product at times.,1
"I just went through a new bleaching and my hair has been through HELL and back over the last year.  This stuff is GREAT (also using Olaplaex 3 once a week).  I LIKE THE SMELL.  I think some people who are sensitive to smell are complaining, but I like it.  I smell salon/beachy fresh when I use it. BEWARE -- Don't use too much.  Go with the directions and don't get too spray-happy with it.  If so, your hair will need another washing very soon because it will cause too much buildup.  This stuff is good.  Use it as it is directed and get a feel for how much you need and you'll be happy.",1
I really enjoy this product because it does a really good job at making my hair softer and smoother. I also like that you can use a little bit and it goes a long way.,1
This is superb stuff. It really gave me a lovely glow which looked natural and not orange.,1
"Purchased in October 2015 and the on/off switch is not working properly. Only one speed and that is intermittent. This is the 2nd time I treated myself to an expensive hair dryer, 2nd time I have been very disappointed. All my cheap hair dryers still work.",0
"I love this product, but it was shipped without a lid.",1
Excellent product.  Does wonders for my cuticles.,1
"Just what I was looking for, clean scent!",1
I have very dry hair and this saved it! My hairy looks so shiny and moisturized! Im so happy,1
"This product does a nice job - looks very natural, has no orange tint, did not give me any irritation.  The only downside is the smell (smells like an attempt to disguse a bad smell with perfume....).",1
"At first I didn't quite believe that this was a combination shampoo and conditioner. Those don't have a very good reputation and deservedly so. So the first few times I used R+Co Analog Cleansing Foam Conditioner, I used another shampoo first, then used the R+Co as a conditioner. It worked very well, my hair was soft with good body, better than my usual conditioner (Pantene). Then I checked the company website for more guidance and decided to use it as directed. It didn't foam like a normal shampoo, so I was not reassured, but my hair did feel clean and it looked fine. A few more days of using it as a shampoo/conditioner, and I am convinced. My hair and scalp are as clean as they are with regular shampoo, and the conditioner works better than average. And I get to skip an entire step in my hair care routine.",1
Poor packaging.  The pump is defective.,1
"The Pureology Hydrate Shampoo and Conditioner are the best products on the market.  My hairstylist herself uses them, which is always a good sign.  They keep my hair soft and smoothe and smell fantastic!",1
"This was recommended to me by my dermatologist. good & creamy disappears quickly on my dry skin. Compares with my favorite skin medica eye cream. It is pricey but aren't all eye creams. However, this is worth a try as it really smooths those pesky crows feet!",1
"Like the product however, the bottles  leaked because the cap was open and lost over half of the product. Would like to get one of the packages replaced. It was a slight mess when I received it.",1
"I didn't buy the FOREO here, but just wanted to add, go on you tube if you have problems on how to use this device. Watch more than one presenter because a couple tell you nothing but there is one lady who gets with it, showing a bowl of water to dip the FOREO in to get the tip wet, the part you use, and she is very good at explaining how this should be used. Personally, my skin seems to be very sensitive to this so I use it only once a day on low setting, and it has worked wonders on the pours around my mouth, where I needed it most. I almost feel like I can cut down to every other day. Also, some people think they need a computer to plug this into, but you don't. Use one of your USB plugs that plug into the wall that comes with another device, or go to a store that sells TVs, computers, celphones, etc and see if they have a USB wall plug there. I know Apple probably does and you don't need to own an apple device to purchase one,  you just need to buy the wall plug with the port to plug this in with. If you work with your FOREO you will find it's pretty nifty, maybe using it full blast a couple times a day is too much, especially if like me, your skin is sensitive.",1
"Got blue. It is a nice color. weight of the curtain is pretty good, a bit lighter/flimsier than I would choose, but it is definitely durable and serviceable. Only real gripe is that this product is advertised as ""odor free"", and there is a vinyl-ly odor when the package is opened. After a couple of days it is not so strong. I thoight that PEVA was supposed to be odor free? I would probably order again, but would leave the curtain in the garage for a few days to get rid of the odor.",1
"I got this brush for my fiances birthday. She LOVES it. I felt ridiculous spending 150 on a hairbrush, but honestly I can tell the difference in softness when she uses it. I would recommend it to anyone as a gift to any woman who knows what it is, if she doesnt she might say,""You spend how much o a hairbrush?""",1
It really does work!!!!!!!,1
"This is the first review I have ever written, although I  always  find them helpful and do read them for everything I purchase on Amazon.  Many times, actual customers opinions and experiences have been the deciding factor in actually making a purchase. Honest opinions of other people  like me, who have actually purchased whatever it is I'm considering buying are always very much appreciated and really do help me decide when I went on the fence about a product for sure!! I've been using Amazon for years yet this is the first product line I feel strongly enough about that I will write a review  and perhaps it will help you decide to try Nuxe for yourself, trust me you will not be disappointed. In fact, you may love it so much, like me, you will purge your home of all other products and throw them in the trash, yes, it may hurt a bit thinking of all the money you wasted on them but these products are so affordable you will be delighted  and save money in the long run. They are by far as good if not exceeding those overpriced  ""luxury"" department store brands  (....never again lured  to the mall, seduced by unethical sales methods and false promises of the global beauty industry giants....male  dominated executives and their universally unethical and untruthful corporate bombardment and brainwashing of women  around the world, through consistent and carefully crafted, slick and sexy seduction, truth be told, the  out right global brainwashing of women via endless bombardment of beauty product endorsement via tv/ magazine, etc. advertisements, full of lies and downright outrageous false promises of  magical transformation of skin(.... and lives!!), youth restored  and beauty created if you just buy their ""snake oil"" creams and bottled beauty potions and lotions.  Women are victimized by a world of  slick, sexy tv/magazine  campaigns design by advertising  agencies hired by some  money hungry (.... probably male to boot!!) executive of those expensive ""luxury brands""  always promoting products after products after new products with false promises of yet another wonder of science skin care miracle product.
  Sorry to go on like that but it's how I feel and with these products I feel actually emancipated!! I really do see wonderful  results and I cannot believe how well  they perform!! Alll while making no promises or even advertising in the US....my skin is transformed!!  I suggest you try them all, if you feel as I do after, please leave a comment yourself and maybe let me  what you thought of the product and also, I'd love just to know my review helped and that I reach someone, and, like me spared another innocent, totally hapless and hopelessly doomed  luxury brand department store shopper the stress  and expense of the  ""beauty counter encounter"" and  finding themselves that much poorer after falling prey to a beauty counter shark wearing lipstick and a lab coat!! Spare yourself  the expense and worse....the inevitable, uncomfortable, exhausting  and self defeating encounter with all those trolling, commission-hungry-sales-obsessed-daily-quota-driven  cosmetic sales people and treat yourself, treat your skin to this wonderful line of unbelievably affordable true  luxury skincare line!! I've been using  The micellar water, the honey face/body cleansing gel, the rosewater toner and of course  their flagship product, Huile Prodigeuse ( on my face but also all over especially after a shower it's wonderful!! )  faithfully every day and my skin is noticeably  improved, softer, smoother  and with a natural radiance that has actually been commented on  by several of my friends and family more than once and when I look in the mirror I truly feel more beautiful and youthful looking, I am completely sold on Nuxe skin care line and will continue to use it always!!  I fully endorse the product, I love it even more as I add more and more of the product line(.... I add a new product  as budget allows. :-) )  to my regimen. I have been using Nuxe products faithfully every day, with  nothing but very happy results and  noticeably  improved skin, since I first started about six months ago. A friend gave me a small sample bottle of the multipurpose miracle product, the amazing Huile ProdigueseI have been using solely Nuxe products ever since and was happy to find them on here on Amazon, where my deliveries are super quick and Nuxe is priced right on target, plus they're Prime Products, so my cost for delivery is free!!
Wishing you beauty that truly makes you smile, from your skin care regime and your life!! Namaste <3",1
very good,1
"I bought this (fairly expensive) eye cream from my dermatologists office.  Before bed that night, I eagerly ripped open the package and carefully applied the product around my eyes...the next morning I went right to the bathroom mirror-- Yikes! Never had bags around my eyes before- huge bags and very dark circles.  Hopped a flight that morning and all through the day my eyes were watering uncontrollably.

Not a winner.

Dermablend is amazing.  It covers everything up easily and does not sweat off.  You have yo use soap to get it off and then it comes off easily.,1
"The container arrived with a huge crack down the side and the product leaking out! When spending this amount of money on conditioner, one might expect that it would arrive in prime form. I was very excited to try this conditioner, but now I am very bummed as it is a huge mess.",0
Love the smell and not greasy,1
Love it,1
Softer head than i expected.,1
I color my hair and it stays very soft.  Does not dry out like previously used products.  I greatly appreciate it because it is a gluten free product and not tested on animal.s,1
I'm sure this was intended for men but I'm a woman with a short pixie cut and use pomades for shine. About the only thing I like of this was the very minor scent that wasn't overwhelming. It gave my red hair no shine at all and made it very dull and sticky.,0
perfecto,1
This is not an authentic product.  It does not smell anything like what I've purchased from my salon.,0
"I am mixed and have mixed (mostly black) hair. This iron works well on my hair, and gets it completly straight, and the next morning i don't have to do it because the effect lasts long.
pros-heats up fast, long swivel cord, small enough to make beautiful curls
cons-doesent work well with any product in my hair like heat protection
all in all, its worth the money, but for the same price there are some better irons out there",1
"I have been using this mask two times a week to combat adult acne and I feel like it's making a difference. I have very oily skin with random breakouts and some annoying cystic acne on my chin that never wants to go away. I'm seeing a reduction in breakouts. It's not completely gone but I'd say at least 75% cleared up and it's actually helping some with the chin cystic acne. It tingles a little bit when I put a thin layer on but I wouldn't call it painful. My skin does peel a little bit the day after use but that's easily fixed with some oil free facial moisturizer. Since my skin is so oily and I live in a very hot weather area, I am liking how it's drying my face some so I'm not so oily and shiny all the time. The tube is small but if you are careful to not glob it on, it can easily last over a month.",1
Leaves my hands feeling silky smooth! Love <3,1
"This stuff is pretty good and it really does go on nicely.  I am still trying to perfect the liquid eyeliner line but so far, this is one of the easier ones I have used.  For me I am trying to make a thin line and it works great for that.  I also think you can use it for a somewhat thinker line by holding differently but like I said, I am still trying to get used to liquid eyeliner :)",1
"I have dry, fine, curly hair that gets easily tangled and weighed down by most moisturizing conditioners. This works so well for my hair making it look shiny and healthy! A little goes a long way. I will be buying more when o finish this bottle!",1
Very light:-),1
Did NOT receive the full 2.5 fl.oz. that I paid for. The jar arrived half full and I even weighed it to be sure!!,0
Didn't work for me to strong,0
"My skin felt really nice after using this lotion, unfortunately the scent makes me nauseous to the point that I just can't use it. After about an hour i had to wash it off. I'm very surprised so many people love it and think it's subtle. I find it overwhelming and my daughter even made a face and commented on how strong it is. I'm disappointed.",0
"I bought this to go with my new badger shaving brush and double edged safety razor.  The trio work together wonderfully, and this Proraso shaving cream smells good and keeps my face safe and happy.  Also delivered before I expected it!",1
"This is so light and makes your skin feel cold and hydrated, love this!!",1
"I bought these because of a recommendation I read saying that the person had oily hair with dry ends. That's what I have and I keep looking for the best shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo is just awful and leaves my hair knotted, stiff, and dry. The conditioner makes the hair smooth but my hair always feels weighed down and looks greasy. I wouldn't buy it again but it may just not be for my hair type.",0
Love it! It's weightless and once it dried Matte. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin and the slight white cast from the mineral compliments my fair skin. It may cast too much of a white hue on tanner skin tones. They should try the tinted version.,1
Lasted about 5 days before warring off at edges.,1
"Good stuff.  A little goes a L O N G way so a tube last quite a while, at least for me.  Others have written all the positives.  My only complaint is I shave every day.  My beard is not dark.  As such, and unlike a cream, it can be hard to see where I've shaved.  Not a huge deal but I find myself going over the same lines to be sure.",1
Simple clean smell. I use this when I want to change up my cologne when I shave.,1
"I have always been a fan of OPI lotions but this one was different, after applying it left my arms tacky feeling. After about an hour I took the lotion of with a wet washcloth.",0
"It does not get as hot as my other non-ceramic curling irons from the same manufacturer. I went back to using my old one. Don't waste your money on particular one. The gold ones from Hot Tools work great, just not this one.",0
Wow not sure if I have a bad razor or what.  I have a mekur 34c HD and a 38 c also.  Both shave great the 23c however never gives a good shave regardless of angle or blade used and Ive tried about 10 different types of blades and used this razor around 30 times.  I either get nicked to hell or it leaves stubble.  Ive been wet shaving several years so I feel like its not user error LOL!!  Do yourself a favor and but a 34c HD.,0
I like it and getting a lot of complements,1
Don't waste your money. Doesn't work!,0
"After reading all the great reviews on Amazon about this product, I decided to try it.  I used it for three weeks and I have to say it is the worst skin product I have ever used.  It completely dried out my skin, my skin became like leather.  It didn't diminish or reduce lines & wrinkles, it seemed to create and enhance them.  I read in the instructions that I could experience dryness during the first ten days of use and to use a regular moisturizer after applying the Nia24.  So I just plunked down a lot of money so I could use a moisturizer on top of a moisturizer.  I used the product for three weeks and saw no improvement.  So I called Amazon and they refunded my money that day.  At least I received a good customer experience from Amazon.com, always customer focused!",0
"Love this shampoo but my package arrived with broken pump and shampoo had leaked all over inside the package, a lot was wasted",0
"I had an original 413 for a few years and loved the brush until my dogs got ahold of it. Mine was black so I ordered 1 of these because I was so glad I found them.  They are crap and nothing like the original. Don't order them. After a month the whole bristle part rubber and all came apart from the cheap handle. I never was so disappointed in my life. They cannot be real products of PM. He would not allow this cheap crap to have his name on it. I contacted the company bc when the brush arrived it was already missing bristles. I told them I didn't appreciate a crap knock off product.
I sent this email to them:
I received this item late and it was missing several bristles. I have previously owned this brush that I bought at a salon but my dogs ate it. I don't feel like this item was an authentic item as it was much lighter that the one I had and the quality was very poor.
Heather
The response from them was that they do not sell fakes and to send them pictures of the missing bristles. I did as they said and sent them the pictures on Sept 22. To this day no response from them which shows me they don't stand behind their products and I hit the nail on the head when I said fake.",0
"I have been using this on my face for the pas few weeks. It seems to really help with the fine lines, making them look smoother and less noticeable. On the deeper lines however, to my disappointment I didn't notice much difference. I'm hoping with continuous use it will improve.",1
It doesn't hold a curl like I thought it would after reading all the reviews. My hair went flat almost instantly after curling. Even with hairspray and on high heat.,0
"Hate hate hate!
Was told to buy this, works just like my 20 dollar Walmart one. Now I'm out money
Wish I could return this over priced junk",0
I'm can't tell if this is the real deal...the bottle is the same as my old one but that's about it ...but i don't think its smells the same and the bottle top is not a spray...it's just a pour and  to put the lid back is not easy....also the color of the after shave is def a different color...way dark this new one....the right is my old one.,0
This is one of those products that it depends on who you ask.  I did not like this product it burned my skin.  Made my skin red like a sun burn.  I have used their competitors version of this type of product and thought it was much better and cheaper as well.  I don't recommend or not recommend.,0
"I never have time to write a review, but this tme i had to make time.  My last two purchases of this product have been terrible, both the product and the packaging.  Both times, the product arrived looking, old, beat up, dated and crusty inside.  Overall, ive used this product for several years and its a hit or miss, it almost feels like theres an eperation date that should be included, but there isnt. I won't be purchasing this again, is too unteliable, and i won't be purchasing from the seller.  They should do a better job at only selling fresh products, mine seemed as if it had been opened.",0
"This is my second purchase. One eyebow is much lighter than the other. This helps even them out, and it looks very natural.",1
"This is a new one from Claus Porto but I will openly state that it is one of the finest that I have ever used and strongly recommend it!  The new scent is very, very good and I seriously doubt if there will be many that will not like it right off. As so many others from Claus Porto, yes, this lasts much longer than a regular bar of soap while throughout it's use provides more softening results than most are commonly accustomed to.  The wonderful new scent lasts just as long too - to the very end!  These hand bar size will last ususally between one month to one & a half months per bar.  That's based on one usage per day.  The 12.3 oz. size bars will last up to 3 & one half months based on the same usage level.  That, in comparison to everyday  common soaps is incredibly longer and who would rather for the shorter period?? Basic thought along the dollar & cent line. . .  Again, I highly recommend this one to everyone!! Once you've used it you'll never go back to something else!!!",1
Not happy with how this sprayer works.  I find that sprinkling out of the bottle does a more direct job.  It seemed like a good idea but it actually blows out too much air causing the fibers to blow around too much and not end up where you want them which in turn causes you to use more product.,0
Love it. made my face look and feel radiant,1
No!!,0
Love it such luxury!,1
"Very disappointed. Did not work, was not clogged and had to throw it away.",0
"I'm a huge fan of hot rollers. I purchased this set because of the portability - my sets at home are too clunky to bring while travelling.

My issues with this set:
1) If the rollers are not inserted PERFECTLY (and you might think they are!), they will not heat up. Yes, they have markers on them to indicate if they are heated but if you're not watching them, you may easily not notice until you go to use them.

2) These don't get overly warm to begin with even after letting them sit for 25 minutes.

3) Rollers are heavy, resulting in them pulling down on your hair and slipping out of the clips (some people point out that many sets don't come with clips so this is a courtesy but for $120, it's not a courtesy, it's part of the item I'm paying for and they aren't working as they should)
Positives of this set:

1) Portability. That's about it.
I tried these many times with different products (hairsprays, mousse, au naturel), with freshly washed and second day hair... I just was not impressed. I'll stick with my $40 sets (of different sizes) and bring a curling iron for travel purposes.
I returned this item.",0
"It was dried up.  I had ordered this before and it was very good.  I don't remember where I ordered it from.
I returned it.  The return process was very easy.",0
"helps with acne, but makes me skin peel.",1
"has a great taste, texture and doesnt feel like its full of chemicals like some other toothpastes on the market today. Love the design of the tube too. its a little pricey but it might last longer than other toothpastes. seems i don't need as much paste to lather up as before.",1
do not buy this you will receive damage condition,0
"Have to agree with everyone that says this is a counterfeit.  Ive used it maybe 5 times its already drying out, it comes off after using a lash curler and has to have about 2-3 coats.  Dont buy this.  I wish Amazon Would investigate this.",0
"Didn't do anything for my hair in particular. I wouldn't call it a fake because I have not had Olaplex done in a salon, but this was think and watery and seemed to me like it was diluted.",0
"a bit dry for my perfect liking but cool to have a change up from the ""clean cut"" or the tea trea shaping cream. great dry hold",1
I LOVE THIS SPRAY. Makes my face feel clean and refreshed. However the way that it was packaged allowed the product to leak into the bag. Not happy about that.,0
I guess you need to use the entire bottle to before you see any changes. I won't buy it again,0
"I had high hope for this product faithfully using it for 2 months, I can confirm that it is absolutely worthless. Did nothing to help ingrown hairs on my neck at all. Feel totally ripped off for spending so much on this snake oil. AVOID!",0
Great product for the normal acne problems! I love it,1
"Pleasant smell. Felt like any other handwash. Packaging very plain. For the price, I would never purchase it again.",0
"close to it.  The ladies seem to like it. :)  Its a little too much clean soap and floral for a men's cologne, but it smells good enough that you forget that.  I wear it most days over Aqua di Gio.",1
"I tried this in place of my usual spinning brush. They package it very nicely; it really felt like a luxury item when I was opening it. The device comes with a usb charger (kind of strange) and is pre-charged for immediate use. It has a very sleek look and fits nicely in the palm of your hand. The silicone seemed soft, but I wasn't sure how exfoliating it was going to be. There is one main button, you press it to turn on and also to change speeds. You have to cycle through both speeds to get it to turn completely off (the light will stay on to alert you). Now I will preface this by saying I have a vestibular condition and I get dizzy very easily, but I found the vibration and the sound of this device to be way too much for me to handle. It felt like it was shaking my brains and it made me dizzy. I could try to overlook that if by some chance this was a miracle exfoliator and skin repairer, but I didn't find it exfoliated my skin and I really didn't think it did much at all. It does seem easy to clean, but you can't just replace the brush like you can with other devices, so you would have to purchase an entirely new device every time it wore out. Won't be continuing to use this.",0
I have to agree with some reviews that these eyeliners from Amazon aren't as good of a quality as the ones from a store like Ulta or Sephora. They're more watery and therefore cause streaks whenever I apply them. And they fade throughout the day. The ones I buy from the stores don't do any of that. Not sure if these are just old or knockoffs but they're not of the Stila quality.,0
"I've never tried the Xtah so I have no comparison there. My stylist cut my shoulder-length bob to a really short (too short) boy cut about eight weeks ago, and it didn't need any product at all.  But as it grows out, it needs a little something.  I find that a fingernail-sized amount of Craft Clay, smeared between my hands and roughed through my clean wet hair, dries it perfectly with shape and body, and keeps it that way all day.  The second day, after sleeping on it, it still looks good, too.  Love this stuff.  It has even replaced my Osis Dust It, which I used to swear by, because this is easier to wash out (I alternate between Drench and Volupt shampoos).",1
"For those (such as myself) who didn't carefully read the discretion - it's not a gel but some sort of paste... It has a very unpleasant texture and a disgusting scent which I still can't describe... Bottom line, there are much better products out there.",0
Color is really sheer. I put on two coats and it gave a little bit of lavender color but I can clearly see my original nails. Slightly different than what I thought.,1
It made my hair super dry.,0
Great razor!,1
Didn't glide on for a smooth line.,0
I have been using it for years however just tried the peel and it was lovely...I have sensitive skin and this product is very gentle I am 62 years old and any facial I go for they compliment the condition of my skin and I live in San Diego (sun country),1
gift,1
KEEPS EYE AREA HYDRATED,1
I love the product but unfortunately this can did would not plump no matter how much I shook it. It came out watery and that is a problem. I think it must be a bad batch since I have never had this problem before. I guess I had better buy it from my salon to ensure it works properly. for the price it should not do this.,0
Terrible. Does not fit my Issa toothbrush though the head looks identical. Wrote to company's customer service and have yet to hear back! Take a look at the photo the attachment is clearly not the same as the head that came with the toothbrush. Its the same size but the design of the opening doesnt allow it to lie flush on the toothbrush.,0
"I've been using the old formulation of the green tube (Menthol Eucalyptus) for years. It was fantastic!  Probably one of the best shaving creams ever produced. Sadly they reformulated it and completely ruined the product.  It no longer has the amazing body and slipperyness of the old formulation.  It no longer protects the skin like the old version.  It doesn't lather like the old version. It feels thin and cheap like the drugstore spraycan shave creams.  Oh Proraso what have you done!  Honestly the old cancer causing chemicals were probably worth it.  Now we're stuck with this wimpy new age crap.  Also note the green smelled great and the red version will make you smell like grampa. Try it.  Just lather up and wait for all the old ladies in the nursing home to come running (actually, shuffling with their walkers).  Truly a disappointment from a formerly fine company.  I should have stockpiled the old formulation like Rentisham's Flenting Wax.",0
"I have the black/white ""high impact"" version of this product and it works great. Wanted another but was unavailable so got this instead. It really doesn't curl my lashes at all. Given how much others like it, I think it is simply the wrong shape for *my* eye.",0
Love the product but the light brown side crumbled in my makeup drawer in less than two weeks. It was expensive and I won't buy it again. Too bad I love the product but it turned into powder.,0
I love the Elta sunscreen so I thought I would try a few more products in their line.  I am really disappointed by the difference in quality.  I feel like there is a film on the top if my face in the morning that never got absorbed.,0
Works fine but not as well as my Chi.,1
"She has been using it daily, Does not look a day over 70",0
"This stuff works great! It has a nice strong hold - a little more tacky feeling than American Crew Fiber. The finish is matte and it needs little to no restyling. The hold isn't crunchy in any way either.
The product itself functions very well.

What makes me choose this product over others though is the ingredients. Most cosmetics have many harmful chemicals that cause neurotoxicity, organ system toxicity, reproductive harm, and cancer. This has very few of those elements compared to other cosmetic hair products. See [...]

Overall there is limited danger from this product - though I'd prefer less and would switch to less risk if I knew of one.",1
"I received this as a Christmas gift and since then have seen it at Kohls.  I like using it because it reminds me of the person who gave it to me, but I wouldn't recommend this body wash, at least not in this scent.  The Blood Orange & White Pepper has such a weak scent to it, I feel like I'm using ""faded"" or old product.  Also, I don't think that it suds up very well (I'm confused because other's had the opposite experience per their reviews); compared to the Dove or copy-cat generics that I usually use, I need to use a lot more product to get a lot of suds.  I did love the scent and feel of the Blood Orange & White Pepper Body Butter though :)",0
"it arrive without the bottle cap, and even feels really light like much has spilled or don't know, i feel robbed",0
Clumpy,0
"I got this for my wife, you really cares for her hair. As a guy, I could care less, but it makes her happy, and I am ,going to build a hanger for it so that it is always in reach. Seems to dry hair very well!",1
Good product but expensive,1
I am very satisfied with this product.,1
"PROS: It's got great ingredients. Does hold my hair nicely w/o being too stiff or sticky. CONS: Price. AND IT STINKS! Ugh, the fragrance is horrible! and overwhelming.",0
Good,1
"I was let down by this product.  It left my hair stiff and crunchy, I won't use it again.  There was nothing natural about the way it left my hair.",0
It makes clean my face easier.......and after using it my face feel more smooth.,1
"Ive used lafco candles before and Ski House is just not as fragrant as the others. Too bad. I don't recommend  this fragrance. I DO, however, recommend the Lafco candles - they're expensive but well worth it.",0
"Seeing as this is my first curling iron, I really don't know what to say about it. All I know is my curls aren't turning out very good, but I'm assuming it's my own fault seeing as I'm new at this. I just have a feeling there are better ones out there, but this was cheap, so... whateva.",1
I have had it before but this did not work out reall well,0
ok product still using it but a little high priced for the size of bottle,1
"I bought 3 bottles.
One bottle came empty.
What a shame!

So instead of having 3 products, I only have 2.
Am I getting a refund?
Thanks",0
"At first I was a little skeptical. The dryer is very heavy. My stylist recommended this brand because I kept going through the cheaper ones. Well, after using it for a month, I decided it was worth the price and I loved the power. For a powerful appliance, surprisingly quiet. I would definitely recommend to anyone who wans a better quality dryer!",1
"I actually never realized what a difference a quality hair dryer makes, since I never owned one so good!  It dries SOOO much faster, and even when I just fast blow out my just past my shoulder length naturally wavy hair, it looks great, and I don't have to try to do something with it with the curling iron anymore!  Also, one of the settings is actually cool air!  Not just a cool blast button, but the actual setting!  Hot, warm, and cool settings.  I should actually buy another now, while I can!  Highly recommend this dryer!",1
"Purchased Teamine from my dermatologist in March of 2017. After 2 weeks of applying as instructed (twice a day), my undereye area became red and inflamed. Called my dermatologist and was advised to stop using and possibly try later only applying once a week. Well, here it is September of 2017. I decided to try again. One day after just ONE application my undereye area became so swollen, red and blistery. Will NEVER try again! Warnings of these side effects should be emphasized more!",0
Like Toppix,1
"I was happy with the product until researched the list of ingredients. It is inexcusable for a premium brand to continue using parabens in 2015. EWG overall score is 7 as hight hazard on scale 0-10. Art of Shaving aftershave scored 2, just FYI. It was enough for me to refuse using it and request a return.",0
"Love this product! High quality, excellent price.",1
Too soon to tell the long term impact,1
Very happy with my purchase,1
"I received mine with the top off I'm assuming is from transit. The top part of the gel is smeared inside the bottle.
I won't go through the trouble of returning it as its more haste to go out of my way to return it.

I suggest buying this from a salon it's actually cheaper and Floyds barbershop and at least there you'll know it's new.",0
"Ive always liked this brand of wipes, and have been willing to spend more for the quality.  However, this package is has very small wipes and is overpriced imo",0
"Just received this perfume and was verrrryyyyy dissappointed in such an expensive purchase.  I have a bottle at home that only had a little bit left and wanted to get a bigger bottle so that it last longer.  I wish I would have ordered from the same person i got the small bottle from, because after reading the reviews I can honestly say this big bottle is a fake.  It smells nothing like the small bottle i already have.  It seems to be watered down or mixed with alchohol.  I sprayed enough on where you should be able to smell it, but you hardly do.  It is a fake and the seller should be ashamed for continuing with this phony product!!!!!!!!!!!! I want my money Back!!!!!!!",0
Too heavy and the vent spins and doesnt stay on! Not a good thing if your doing  hair stylist work. Wish I can just return it ,0
"I had read rave reviews about this conditioner in Allure magazine and on Amazon as well, so I decided to give it a shot. I had previously been using Frederic Fekkai glossing conditioner. I have found that they both do a good job with the glossing aspect; my fine, color-treated blonde hair has never looked shinier. I do feel that the Fekkai conditioner does a better job of nourishing my hair though. The Molton Brown conditioner definitely leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy, but doesn't feel as soft to the touch. Either way, I am happy with the overall product and love all Molton Brown products, but will probably return to the Fekkai conditioner once I run through this bottle.",1
Its hard to find a mousse that does enough yet isn't sticky and doesn't weigh hair down. This works better than anything I have found so far.,1
This soap lathers great and smells great but its not as good for sensitive skin as they stated. After using it 3 times my neck was on fire With red raised bumps for 2 days after each shave.,0
It doesn't work. I've been using for 2 months with no visible improvement. This is the second Strivectin product I've purchased (other product is their Vitamin C concentrate) and very disappointed with the results on both exceptionally expensive products.,0
"Like many other reviewers, my reasoning for purchasing this product is because I have keratosis pilaris on my arms. I tend to just live with it most of the time, but if I have a special occasion coming up then I will use this (and the lotion) religiously. I was gearing up for my wedding, so of course I used this! It works well as long as you use it regularly, but be careful! It is not for those with sensitive skin and I have burned myself with this stuff on more than one occasion. It works well for acne also, so I would occasionally use it on my chest or back, but that skin is significantly more sensitive than my arms so I would tend to burn myself if I used too much/too often.

As long as you're careful, this stuff will work wonders. KP is a pain in the behind, but Glytone definitely helps manage it.",1
"I just returned this product to Amazon after realizing it contained the chemical triclosan for use as an antibacterial additive. I know, I know triclosan is FDA approved but that hardly should give anyone complete comfort (remember this is the same FDA who just last week finally came around to the conclusion trans fats are actually harmful--wow, shockingly late to that party). Yes, I also know triclosan is listed on the ingredient disclosure online, I just somehow missed it. Please do your own homework into why triclosan is a noxious and toxic chemical you absolutely do not want on your body, in your body or in our waterways.",0
Highly recommended by my hairdresser.  I use it faithfully and hope it will help with my thinning hair!,1
Stopped blowing hot air after only six months of ever other day use. The positive and negative light indicator was horribly bright - had to put tape over it. The blowing air force was either too strong or not strong enough. Dried hair quickly but was heavy to use.,0
good product!!!,1
"I was really excited about the concept of this product, as I am a powdered dry shampoo user in the interest of saving water, and thought this couch be a nice tool in my product collection, but it is truly awful.  I could see this being POSSIBLY useful for someone with really short hair who wants to skip a wash and have some lift if used JUST in the roots, but even that is hard for me to picture being manageable.  The product is so sticky and grainy that while it does have the effect of removing oil, what's left in your hair is way grosser than oil.  It might look passable, but it feels just terrible, my hairbrush stuck in it and it broke my hair, I couldn't wash it off my hands and after THREE shampoos, I could still feel it in my hair (getting a comb stuck in it), and that was all using a TINY amount, and rubbing it well between my fingers before applying it sparingly.

I used it once and thought it was gross but decided to at least play with it once more before a shower in case I had used too much or hadn't thinned it enough, but no, it was still awful.

As others have said, the smell is nice enough but not overpowering, which is the only nice thing to say about this product.  I am certainly glad this was a review item.. if I had paid the crazy price for this I would be returning it for my money back.",0
"Just can't get past the strong smell. While the smell might fade in terms of others' perception, the smell lingers in my nostrils.",0
"It didn't get rid of my itching completely, but it definitely helped.",1
Amazing product amazing price amazing quality a makeup lovers dream product perfect for setting League of applying makeup applying directly to skin after facials smells amazing but not too overpowering not sticky helps blend makeup and set it looking naturally will definitely repurchase and highly recommend,1
I love the curling brush!,1
Best product I've found to give me soft conditioned feel and maintain bouncy defined curls. I won't use anything else anymore!,1
"I was happy with this dryer for about the first week, after which Low speed no longer worked and it was stuck on High all the time.  It sounds like a few other reviewers have had this same issue.  I would not recommend this product, and am going to buy the Helen of Troy Professional Ceramic Hair Dryer (which I've used at my gym and works great, and seems to be a higher quality product) instead.",0
not worth a price. Just use the product twice & it does not work any more.,0
"It didn't do anything for my rough skin texture and clogged pores. I used it every other day, then once a week. My skin just got drier and rougher. I ended up getting a microdermabrasion at a skin care clinic and it gave me the results I was actually looking for.",0
"This has become one of my go-to polishes since adding it to my collection. I've received multiple compliments on it when out, and love the different hues that come out in different lights. It goes on thick and easily, and looks GREAT with a matte coat on top. I will definitely be buying this color again when I run out.",1
The second time to buy it!,1
polish I received was old and sticky.,0
Didnt really do much to my hair and I definitely didn'ike the smell,0
"I have purchased this product before from my stylist, however to save time I ordered it online. The product in this bottle did not have the same consistency, smell, feel, or lather the same as my prior bottle from my stylist and it irritated my head.",0
"I bought this brush because it was on a recommended list on some beauty magazine/website. Perhaps I was just used to my old brush (part natural bristles), but after a few months of use I still can't stand this brush. The bristles are so pokey! Ouch! I've likely passed the deadline so I may not bother returning it but will either pitch it or give it away. Seems like it may work for someone else.",0
"I like the trimmer a lot, but I don't like the attachments.  The shortest attachment is 1/4 inch and this is too long for my taste for my beard length.  But the trimmer is great, holds a charge a long time and I love the t-bar.",1
this tinted moisturizer is more like a liquid foundation.  It is very opaque and a bit dull .  The color is not flattering; as it appears a bit on the orange side.,0
Love this stuff! Makes my baby smell like heaven! So glad I can get it on amazon instead of driving an hour to Nordstrom!,1
"Clean by Zirh is not a bad product. However, after using it for 2-3 weeks, some rashes appeared on my face. I discontinued its use and after a while decided to get back to it, with the same odd results.
I really believe it can be helpfull for some people, maybe those ones that have oily skin, but definetly not for me.",0
"I'm in my early 30's and have a receding hairline. You ever sleep with hairspray on your hair and to wake up next morning with linty hair? That's exactly how I would describe the texture when you use this on your hair. I purchased color black with the pump sprayer, pick/comb, and their hairspray. I accidently sprayed the toppik powder onto my scalp and noticed the toppik color was more like dark purple. It takes a while to perfect the use of the pump to get the right amount of Toppik sprayed only onto the hair. No matter how perfect your results come out, up real close you can notice something different and I'm sure under the direct sunlight it's probably 10X more noticeable. Toppik claims that people can't even notice 2 inches away, that's bull. This is definitely a better product than Couvre the scalp concealer. Toppik hairspray is like any other strong hold hairspray, absolutely nothing advanced or special about it. The comb is a piece of crap, made out of cheap paper/plastic not even worth a quarter! Go to a dollar store and find yourself a better comb. Toppik comes off easily so avoid moisture even your sweat, wind, and any objects & elements disrupting the do. The money and the time you have to spend to get a half decent look in my honest opinion is not worth it. I rather deal with a wearing a hat then worrying about an embarrassing toppik malfunction. Maybe if you're in your 60's and not as concerned about the natural look then more power to you, but I still think people are over paying for a product that doesn't promise what they claim. I'm currently trying a product called NuHair. I'm taking the vitamin and using their hair serum. I'm only on the second month and hoping to see some results within the next few months. There are no cheap quick fixes that lasts forever so I'm going to commit to this NuHair program for 5-6 months and hope for the best. Figure hair transplant takes up to 6 months anyways so might as well give the natural method a 6 month commitment. If the natural way fails then Rogaine is a possibility and then hair transplant. Bottom line, my girlfriend thinks I wasted my money on this product (toppik) and I'm going to have to agree with her on this. Hope you guys learn from my mistake. If you guys know of any good hair transplant doctors in the bay area CA let me know. Good luck fellas.",0
This is a very small version of supersmile and not worth the money.,0
"Been using this for years! Great product,great seller,Great Price. Freckles almost gone!",1
it's basically water inside. How do you even call this cleansing lotion?,0
Did nothing for my hair besides make it smell great. Smell is amazing though but wouldn't buy it again. I was not even able to use 1/3 of the container before I donated it to my friends hair salon.,0
Expensive but worth it.  Great scent!,1
I have used this product in the past but the tube I received on this order was empty or defective.  Not sure which but other than a very tiny drop I could not get any additional product out of the tube.  I am pretty sure the tube I received was empty as the pump appears to be working.  Have returned for either a refund or replacement.,0
I was really excited to get this straightener because my hairstylist recommended getting a Paul Mitchell straightener and im pretty disappointed. My hair is thick and this straightener does not work well. I have to take the straightener through sections of my hair who knows how many times to get it to be completely straight. It's so light weight that I have to clamp it  tighter on my hair  then I should have to in order for it to straightener my hair a little bit. Overall pretty disappointed. Definitely not worth the money.,0
This is very deceiving.  It is the travel size and is the same price as the full size from other sellers.  It's an amazing product but I will not buy from timetospa again.,0
"This is a really good daily body wash that left me skin feeling super smooth and soft.  Very clean feeling.  The downside is it has a bit of a chemical smell.  I would prefer no scent or a scent that smells a bit better.  It is also expensive.

I prefer to use the once a week product to deep clean my skin and get it smooth:

I am a repeat buyer of Blinc mascara.  I just wish it gave my lashes a little more oomph.  But I like that it doesn't smudge under my eyes.,1
"I purchased three of these, and all 3 have past their expiration date!!",0
"My favorite eye shadow palette. Great colors and staying power for a full day's wear. It is hard to control, though; powder drops off the applicator onto my face when applying despite my best efforts. Cleanup is almost always needed.",1
"I admit, I was a little nervous about choosing this product due to the photo, but picked it when I read the other review that said it worked with her fair skin - I've very fair skin myself. The photo doesn't do it much justice, as the tan side is lighter than depicted, and the pink side a much rosier shade of pink.
The tan side is to help 'matte' your skin, especially if you've pores or areas that you want to 'blur'. Think of it as like a matte powder you put on over your makeup. One word of warning, don't use this if you do apply matte or setting powder first - I always use some after my foundation and then remembered I wanted to use this. >.< Yeah, it works well, but even though they say that you can put this on after your makeup, it's best to put it on after some sort of liquid foundation. For a 'gel', it is almost powdery and blends well, even with fair shades of skin and does help reduce pores and provide some camouflaging effects.
The pink side is what I'd consider more of a 'gel' makeup - it reminds me a lot of some products I bought from Korea that help produce a 'dewy' glow. The pink is like a pink lip gloss, it helps give a bit of sheen without much color, though not as tacky once you pat it on the points of your face you want some glow or highlights (parts of your cheeks, brow, bow of the lip, etc.). I know the 'dewy' effect is really popular right now so this is something that is fun to play with yet it doesn't go overboard too easily.
All of this comes in a sturdy case that will travel well and includes a mirror. It's a nice set that lets you experiment and cover some problem areas and I can see it working well for fair to medium skin tones at least.",1
"Although this is the SAME brand polish used at a reputable spa, THIS one completely flaked off nail by nail in under twenty four hours. Ready for the garbage can!",0
Good hold but VERY strong smell.  THe hold and smell will last all day.  Men with pregnant wives avoid this.,1
"Ive used better bUT.... for a price.
This rose infused water is great for freshening up.",1
Excellent high quality sunscreen. Love that it's tinted.,1
"Purchased ON Amazon, but seller was someone else.  While a product DID come, I am not all too sure it is a real, genuine Burberry product.  Why, well, the 'code' that is hot stamped into the plastic/rubber on the bottle bottom was purposely defaced, to the point of you can't recognize it.  A similar 'code' on the outside box was also defaced to unreadable.  While the box did have the clear overwrap, there are easy ways to re-wrap and make it look original - so I am not at all sure the bottle contain OEM stuff.  Cannot seem to find anyone to provide actual, verifiable proof of why this was done, if they are re-filled, mfg rejects, knock-offs or what, but why would the mfg go to the lengths of completely making those mfg codes unreadable if they weren't trying to hide something.  So, basically, while the price IS certainly less that you'd get it for in high-end dept stores, you may just want to hold off on this one.  I asked someone who I really liked the scent they had on one day what it was, and they specifically said THIS.  Not sure if they lied or were mistaken, or if this might be a totally bogus remake, but what came in this suspicious bottle smelled nothing like the scent on the person I asked.  Live & learn I guess.",0
Tried this at the salon and then bought for myself. I think its a pretty neutral pink toned light polish with very subtle glimmer in it. It took 3 coats to get opaque.,1
Filled with chemicals and made my skin dry:(,0
I gave this sample to my mom and she loves it,1
Great for barbers don't need much! The bottle is alot smaller than the picture! You can get about 30-45 shaves or shape ups with it!,1
This product smells ok and feels good going on. In the shower it feels like its smoothing your hair. Thought I was going to love the results until I saw my hair. It was actually frizzier than when I use my regular shampoo which is $15.00 for a 16oz bottle and handmade. At first it didn't lather well. You really had to work it in there. It was an ok cleanser for an oil shampoo but it just didn't wow me in anyway.,0
My husband really likes this hair creme because it doesn't weigh his hair down or make his hair stiff like hair gel can.,1
Very satisfied with the results,1
I am all about bling and this polish doesn't fail in that department.  It has all the colors in the glitter.  Not just browns. I put it over top of a base color such as brown but it would work with anything.  I love it and my nail salon seems to as well.  They try to keep it every time I take it in there :),1
"Barely any color, disappears very quickly, and odd scent.",0
"I bought this razor as my butterfly opening razor was beginning to show some major wear. While the finish and construction of this razor are great the 3 piece design can be a little cumbersome, especially if you forgot to change your blade before getting into the shower. My only other complaint is that the handle feels very small in my hand, but I only noticed that in the few days after switching from my previous razor and quickly adapted. While I will probably buy another butterfly style razor in the future it will have to be before this one wears out because I don't see that happening anytime soon.",1
Too expensive but gets the job done. At first won't seem like its working but Glytone is strong and will give you smooth skin with continued use.,1
"Our local independent pharmacy carried this product but when a big national chain bought them out I lost my source. Gladly here it is on Amazon. Perfect for setting your makeup, nourishing to your skin after cleaning it off as well. On a long haul flight this is a must have and makes the dry stale air on a flight more bearable. Will buy again and again!",1
"The bottle is terrible. After 1 pump all the cream stays between the nozzle and opening. I needed to tap the bottle ion my dresser to get it to come out.

Product wise, it's just ok since I haven't had too much time to state results.

The bottle is bad design.",0
I was happy with my product.,1
"This make-up remover works great, but a little goes a long way. Try not to get in the eyes. I find it best to use it with the lint-free applicators and then finish it off with the cosmetic sponge. Makes my eye area feel nice and smooth after using it.",1
Great Product!,1
the colors look good even on darker skin tones. easy to apply although I would recommend primer of choice.,1
I like the color and stuff but I hate the application thingy its so hard to paint my nails with it cuz its kinda small and thick. I know its ok for it to he small so you can get all the nail and stuff but it was also thick so when I tried to get the side of my nail it would get the polish on the side of my finger idk its weird asf,0
"I'm disappointed in this product.  I was expecting to get something better than the hand cream I'm using, but I didn't.  I prefer unscented products, and while this at least isn't flowery, it has an odd odor.  I also prefer using a cream that doesn't come off as soon as it's hit with water.  When that happens, I think the cream is sitting on my skin, rather than penetrating.  There are other creams available that penetrate, including my usual cream.  I wouldn't recommend this.",0
It smells good.,1
"I know this got good reviews but honesty it didn't do much with my hair. It may have lightened the red tone a bit, but after 2 treatments it's not much different.",0
"I wanted a professional curling iron so I ordered one through my hair stylist.  She has used this on my hair for years and I've never had an issue with it burning my hair.  My only issue is that she charged me $50, and I could've got it on Amazon for $30.",1
"I have a babyliss pro hair dryer, it's a fairly basic black model that says made in Italy. I hoped this would fit. It initially fit onto the dryer okay, but it soon fell off (onto my head and then into the toilet, for me) once it began to heat up and the plastic began to contract or expand or whatever plastic does. Essentially, it is poorly designed, and I would not recommend buying it. I gave it two stars because Amazon gave me a refund without making me return it. I hate to throw it away but it's pretty much useless to me.",0
"WARNING...The medium brown HairMax is MUCH lighter thant medium brown Toppik!

I wanted to see if I could get away with something less expensive than Toppik. Bad decision. The medium brown color is more like dirty blonde to light brown, if there's even a color you could call this ""dust"". I'm not giving a bad review because I failed to pick the wrong color, that was on me. But, the texture (and color) reminds me of hot cocoa mix. It brushed out as I was trying to style my hair and I had to put more on, so in no way does it save money.

I'm currently waiting anxiously for my medium brown Toppik to arrive and will stay with that product. Thank goodness for Toppik!",0
"Might be an okay creme, but it has an awful smell like a cigarette ashtray.
Truly unbearable.",0
Goes on clear and it really isn't an oily product it goes on my face and dries!! Perfect for people like me with acne and oily skin! My dermatologist recommend It!,1
"I was really looking forward to trying this make up since I already have tried it in a powdered compact, the only problem was that the makeup was exactly one year to the day expired. 01/15 . Very disappointed.",0
"Smells good, works well.",1
"This product initially works as promised, the nails look lovely, but as they grow, the nails become brittle and break.",0
This flakes horribly. Dont waste your money!,0
"I bought this on a whim after reading reviews on makeupalley.com. I usually use it on wet hair then blowdry but last week I used it sparingly on dry hair & it really helped with flyaways, it's been very dry lately indoors (Michigan winters). Smells nice, and works. And most important to me, it doesn't make my hair feel like it's coated with product, and isn't sticky, which I hate.",1
Used this in a hotel.  Leaves hair shiny and silky.,1
very dissapointed... at first it worked great! now I don't even use it because it doesnt work properly,0
"The eyeshadow itself is amazing, Lorac makes great shadows. But it was a mistake to order eyeshadow (or any powder make up) from Amazon, as they do not package it safely. Both the black & rose shade were broken.",0
"I had a prescription 5% that worked okay. This product is amazing. It doesn't take much to use and for me, lasts a long time. It works so much better than what I had before.",1
This product is overpriced for what it is.  Manufacture is making a killing on this.  It was a gift for my daughter so I personally don't use it.,0
Decent quality but pricey.,1
"This palette was pretty disappointing. If you're not pasty white, get a different palette. I do not tan very much (would be considered to be medium range as far as skin color goes), but the only contour shade that shows up on my skin is the deep contour shade. I do not understand all the reviews raving about this palette's high pigmentation as it takes alot of product to get even the dark contour to show up on my face. Not only that, I am left with uneven streaks on my face when i attempt to blend.",0
"The product is good, but it arrived damaged.",0
It did last almost 3 days on my nails which is the same as other well-known brands such as Essie. Not bad but definitely short of their 7 day claim.,1
"Scent doesn't stay on as long as the ones you buy at the department stores, but its basically the same thing for half the cost.",1
"I think this is the second Malin + Goetz product I've used and I'm quickly becoming a fan of the brand.  I find that this moisturizer absorbs into the skin fairly quickly and does not interfere with the subsequent application of makeup.

I find it pretty moisturizing and, oddly, a bit cooling when I use it.  That makes it very nice for the upcoming summer days.  I love that it's oil free.  I am a bit confused about the labeling, though, as the product listing says it's free of silicones but the ingredients list includes ""dimethicone,"" which is a silicone.  (I've verified the ingredients list by visiting the manufacturer's site directly.)  I don't avoid silicones but, if you are avoiding any particular ingredient, you can scroll down the product page to see the full ingredients list.

Note: this may not be vegan.  It contains sodium hyaluronate.  This compound, as used in industry, is almost always extracted from crustacean shells.  (It can also be expressed in some bacteria, though, and there are plant-based compounds that can have a similar effect, and I don't know which one is used here because the package doesn't indicate.  Sodium hyaluronate (sometimes listed as ""hyaluronic acid"") is a carbohydrate polymer that can absorb and hang on to a lot of water molecules.  This moisturizes the skin quite well and may additionally have some effect on fine lines.

I very much like that this doesn't contain artificial dyes or fragrances.  The chamomile should be soothing as well, and I think this is a pretty good choice for sensitive skin.

The only thing I don't really like is the container.  It's a little hard to get the appropriate amount out because of the design (I usually end up with too much).  Overall, this is a nice product, though.  You can use it sparingly (only a little is needed, really), which should help one container last for a long time.",1
Does not lather at all... Its absurd,0
"I was excited about this curling iron because I had seen good reviews on it.  I have very thick hair and I need a curling iron that can get pretty hot, which this one does.  It did get a bad smell after a few uses, even when used on clean hair with no product.  Also, it only lasted about 8 months before it got a short in the cord and I didn't feel safe using it with it flickering off and on.",0
Oe of my favorites,1
Buyer beware do not buy!! I bought it and it literally destroyed my hair it is a knockoff DO NOT BUY!,0
fake not real,0
"This is by far the worst flat iron I have ever used. I have been a licensed cosmetologist for 20 years and I have never used such an ineffective flat iron. It makes the hair very static and fly away. Also, regardless of the heat setting it barely straightens the hair. Worst of all it makes a horrible crunching sound (in other words, it is not smoothing the hair) as I pull it through my hair. A good flat iron should feel like butter but it feels like it is pulling on my hair instead.",0
"I have been using toppik for years, and it is a life saver.  My hair has been thinning for several years now, and since I am a young male it can be particularly distressing when all of your friends still have full heads of hair.  This is not a permanent solution, but it certainly goes a long way.  I simply blow dry my hair once out of the shower, put this on using a handheld mirror, and the thin spots disappear.  Seriously, if you get the right color no one will be able to tell.  I have used it for over two years now and no one has ever noticed that it was powder and not real hair.  I do put a small amount of hairspray over the top to try and hold it in place, but not sure of how well that actually works.  Do your best to get an accurate match of color.  I went with light brown first, and it simply didn't do much no matter how much I used.  Once I switched to medium brown it was like night and day.

As stated, it obviously isn't a permanent solution to hair loss.  I was uncomfortable about using it at first, but my philosophy is that if women can use makeup, I can use this.  It simply provides such a boost of self confidence when I am not worrying what my hair looks like or if my bald spot is showing.  Very, very thankful for this product.",1
Purchased from AmericaRX.  The shampoo I received looked and smelled nothing like the product I've been using for the past 6 years.  Returned.,0
GREAT,1
Red Door is my favorite scent. I've used it for years. But this particular bottle is not the same. I saw someone else state that this smelled different in the 3.3 ounce compared to the 1.7 and smaller bottles. I thought they had to be mistaken. But they were right. This bottle does not smell the same.,0
"Returned because it was thin and somewhat shiny.  I like the Elta Tinted Sunscreen 41 in the tube much better.  This may be convenient, but it is not the same as the product in the tube.",0
"This product is as described. I have been using it for 4 months now and have taken photos with visual improvements!! Only complaint is that when you put it on silent, you don't realize when it is done. Easy charging and storage and durable construction. Battery lasts quite a while too!",1
Only use Elchim hair dryers I gave this one 4 stars because I prefer the dryers that aren't ionic,1
Wear it all the time.  Very nice.,1
"Although this is a little pricey, it's just what I needed!  It feels so smooth upon application, protects my face, and most importantly, doesn't break out my face!  I had been looking for a good quality sunscreen for my face, and this is it!  I will definitly buy it again.  I was worried it wouldn't last very long, because it isn't a huge bottle, but I have had it for a few months and there is still a lot left.  I'm happy I have found this great sunscreen, I love it!",1
"I didn't know I paid 20.00 something for it. Or I wouldn't of purchased it.  I lije it. But no not and will not pay for it again,  just because of the price.  And the so small of a container.  That is way over priced.  Sorry for the negative review.  Because I really love using you as a supplier.",0
"Michelle Phan's ""Porcelain 02"" finish powder is a good, finely particled everyday powder that evenly applies and provides a lasting natural, matted finish that holds up through the course of a day/night.

Do note that ""Porcelain 02"" is for fairer skin but if you browse Phan's website there are plenty of skin reference photos that will help you decide if this is the right hue for you. The powder also comes in a handsomely designed, mirrored compact making this an ideal product to keep in your bag should you need a quick touch up.",1
"My girlfriend loves the smell of this one!
I like that it is not to serious nor to juvenile.",1
"Came in over exceeded timing, smelled great, not sure if some people had bad batches or storage was bad or even maybe someone replaced their bottle with watered down stuff? This is one of my top 3 scents (Diesel, and Hugo Boss the other two) strongly recommend this product to others.",1
Arrived broken :(,0
This is a long lasting blush and it is a very wearable color.,1
"I use a lot of facial sprays and spritzes and this isn't one of my favorites.

First off I'm unclear on what this is supposed to do. Supposedly it tones, hydrates, and provides radiance and protection. But.. why? And from what? It doesn't set makeup, it isn't all that hydrating, I don't find the scent to be particularly pleasing, and I think bliss uses too many buzzwords and phrases (CPR technology, anyone?).

Ultimately, among my collection of facial mists, I don't find myself reaching for this at all. My other sprays have specific purposes - hydration, mattify/oil control, hydration - and I just don't know what to make of this one.",0
"This is an awesome creme foundation. My favorite so far! It is a little darker than I anticipated, but that worked out well for me. You don't need to use much to get good coverage, this way it also doesn't look caked on. Very natural look. I wear this all day long without reapplying too. Love that this covers up all my blemishes!!",1
Sucks,0
"I think this is the perfect lotion for mixed skin. Sometimes my face skin gets really oily, so not using the right face-lotion could be a disaster, plus I would look horrible. on  the other hand, sometimes it get really really dry, specially during winter time, so it start hurting. I have been looking for the perfect lotion, and definitely it is not created yet, but it does not mean that they can't be close to it.

To summarize, I would say this is not the perfect lotion, but it is the closest one. Therefore, I do recommend it.",1
Doesn't last very long.,0
"Not sure how it would have worked, found hair in it when I received it. At least if you are going to send used products clean the hair out of them first.",0
"If you like green nail polishes this is one to get!  It's a very, very pretty Spring/Summer green with gold shimmer.  Two good coats gets the color shown.",1
This item showed up partially unscrewed and the safety seal half peeled away and it looked half empty. Returned immediately.,0
Disappointed. Not as good as other manufacturers.,0
combination of itch cream for bites and drying lotion for blemishes it is hard to resist the urge to shake the bottle,1
Junk should send it back,0
"I spent the big bucks and I do have a product that gives a lovely line but it is hardly waterproof. One swipe took it all off with a damp finger and yes, I did wait 10-15 minutes to allow it to set.",0
Love this product.,1
Perfect for when I wear my hair blown out and still want a some movement but need a little control.  Takes care of flyaways and gives just a touch of texture/body.,1
"Can't use it.  Dries my hair out too much.  Had high hopes, but may work better on  younger hair.than mine.",0
"Read some of the reviews on this product and decided to give it a try.

When I started my first shave with this product I actually had to make sure there was a blade in the razor--and I'm not joking. Right from the first stroke it was THE most comfortable shave I ever had.  And every shave since then has been just as comfortable.  It's so outstanding that I'm confident saying I will never, ever use ""regular"" shaving cream again.

I cannot recommend this product highly enough.",1
"leave me amazed this product really works, I do not abuse their hair, it served its purpose, now almost not one hair iron thanks to this",1
I have extremely oily skin and this helps clean that up without being rough on my face and the smell is great too.  I've only had it a few days but I see this being bought time and time again.,1
Not happy with this straightner. Red light stays flashing and when using it it catches and pulls hair and is not very hot.,0
The shampoo and conditioner arrived in good condition and in the time expected.  The quality is great.,1
didnt like the conditioner so much..... weighed down my hair,0
"This is an ok curling iron. I bought this as a gift for my teen daughter and she is super bummed!  It doesn't get very hot, so it's really hard to get a curl to stay. And if you can get a curl, it falls out an hour later. Disappointed :(",0
Makes your skin smooth While protecting you from the sun,1
"I love most Jane Iredale products, but this one was disappointing. First, it's really small! The cleaner itself is very watery and didn't leave my face feeling clean.",0
"My mistake: ordered wrong product: wanted the (white, but clear-absorbing) creme  :-(",0
To soon to know if it is effective but smell great,1
It has been a great help with my dry skin this winter.,1
not happy it is not what I expected poor volume control and very sensitive to lair length and amount of hair sections. Very disappointing.,0
too many of the same beauty items by different companies - not impressed,0
I would highly recommend this excellent product to anyone. Great for renewing/refreshing skin. Smells wonderful and feels light on your face.,1
"I am no longer dying my gray hair. I have been using this for a month, every other day. I don't really see any brightness or difference. I am 50% gray. I still gave mousey brown/yellow ends in some areas. I thought it was residual dye but my hair is short and all the dye has been cut off. I bought the expressions blue stuff, and will try that tomorrow and get back to you with the results. Who knew trying to have sparkling natural gray hair was such a struggle.",0
"This smells wonderful to me - it is like neroli, or like being in the midst of a Florida orange orchard in full bloom.  I simply love the fragrance, but it is strong, and if you are sensitive to fragrances, you may not like this one.  I love fragrances, the more the better, and I am in love the scent.

The cream itself is light, like a mousse.  It's very moisturizing, and my skin just soaks it up.  It immediately smooths out the finest of lines, and undereye crepe, which is a big problem for me.  This works better than my eye cream for my undereye area.

The jar itself is basic, plastic, and easy to open and use.  It has a wide top so it is easy to get every bit of product from the jar.  The expiration date on mine is over a year in the future.

Downside- it contains a good bit of glycerin and dimethicone. so it can react with some makeup, spf, or other skin products to cause piling when used together.  Sometimes this is avoided by waiting longer after application, but a lot depends on the products being mixed.  This is not working well for me with my SPF products, so that limits my use to days that I stay in and don't wear SPF, or use later at night after I've washed my face for the day.  Otherwise, the piling is so bad it all just rubs off like my skin is peeling.  Still, I find it just SO pleasant to use, that I simply love it.",1
"wasnt too crazy about the smell, very strong flowery. Cute bottle!",1
"I wanted to like this mascara, but after a week it went clumpy. I tried three times and finally gave up and returned.",0
"This curling iron does not get hot enough to keep my hair curled throughout the day. Additionally, the clasp area of the curling iron is weird, so if you like to spiral your hair around the curling iron, it is unlikely that the ends of your hair will get curled. I found this curling iron to be a was of my time and money.",0
"This product holds, but leaves hair needing a shampoo before it can be styled again.",0
The eye cream works really well.  The skin under my eyes feels really soft after using this for a couple of weeks.,1
My favorite lip balm to survive in the winter. I use it at night and my lips are recovered the next day. Love it!,1
I have purchased this item several times. Very happy with this item. I will buy it over and over again.,1
"Not worth it at all. purchase yourself a wax warmer and wax from amazon look at reviews they don't lie. This stuff won't last you much and if you're trying to use it for larger areas be prepared to use the whole product and run out of it quickly. I would not recommend it waste of money. I purchased a wax from amazon and a wax warmer from GiGI and it lasted me a whole Brazilian wax, armpits, upper lip and my husbands back. I still have wax left. Like I said get you a different item with more product.",0
Did not like as much don't aplly thick and take to long to dry,0
It didn't work as soon as I got it. It wouldn't spray anything. They didn't give me a full refund and I had to pay for shipping. Even though it was defective and not my fault. It was the worst customer service experience I've ever had.,0
"I had this put on at a salon and loved it..but like others in the review found it peeled off or chipped.  when I did need to remove it, it took numerous cotton balls and remover to get off...gritty texture....why is it 2x more expensive than other OPI products? Or even other nail polish from Burlesque line?",1
"Love this scent!  I am a fan of the original Obsession and had received a sample of this a while back.  Was glad to find this on here....very nice scent,  warm and spicy.  I love it!  Has great staying power too.",1
"I love this product.  My eye brows are growing, but not all over in the areas where I'm putting the product.  The hair has become darker, but nothing extreme, just in a way where I'm able to see it now (I'm naturally a toehead).  I would recommend this to others, but I'm saddened that it's so hard to find, and I was unable to do so in a store.",1
This item quit working after only 3 months.,0
"Eh, not impressed. Low pigmentation, have barely bothered to use since I've purchased. Not sure if this is legit or not, but if it is a legit product, wouldn't bother trying again.",0
"I have a hard time finding gel that holds my unruly cowlick- ridden hair. This stuff works great. Really good hold (similar to hair glue) and easy to wash out, unlike hair glue type products I've tried.",1
A+++,1
Love this product.  Definitely helps with fly away frizzies.,1
The product I was sold was out of date.,0
Polish chips within a day or two.,0
Precise what I expected and it arrived as it was advertised. Nice to use it in phase of life. Recommend it.,1
"I've given it over 30 days to work, no results.  Don't waste your money.",0
"Very disappointed n this product.  When I tried the hairdryer it made a loud squeaking noise and started to smoke.  I sent it back and re-ordered another one.  When I tried the new one, I had the same issue.  I would not order it again.  I recommend not selling this product or test them out before shipping",0
"This stuff WORKS.... as long as you still have enough hair to play around with. It takes me a little longer to get ready, but coming back from a buzzcut due to thinning hair and getting to style my hair in different ways again is really an awesome thing. It really does a great job of covering up and looking mostly natural. The only thing keeping me from the full 5 star rating is that in sunlight it can look a bit green. I've been able to thwart this off with hair spray, but often I'll just go with a hat if I know I'll be out in the sun for a while.",1
Don't waste your money. Does not stay put at all!,0
Good for my hair and the brand was recommended by my hair stylist. I meant to purchase the Moisturizing version. The Daily shampoo dried my hair out leaving it feel like straw after washing.  Had to use more conditioner to get it back to normal. Will stick with the Moisturizing shampoo going forward.,1
"I don't understand how people can say this is the best curling iron ever. It is just OKAY. I already have a conair one, and it curls better than this. The curls are mediocre and fall apart rather easily. Maybe my hair is too healthy to hold it.",0
The bottle in the pic looks larger than the actual size. Too much money for what you are getting in return. A RIP OFF.,0
The product clearly states that it comes with a brush. I received my package yesterday and the brush was not included. Disappointed.,0
"this is just ok for me, its very thick and makes my face break out a little, I also don't really see or feel any benefit. I like some of strivectins products but this is not one I will purchase again.",0
"Gave this to my teen grandson for Christmas with an electric razor, but he never used it.  Rather than let it go to waste, my daughter tried it on her legs and loved it.",1
I really liked the color of this polish. It was rather opaque without having to apply multiple coats. The one thing I did notice was that it was kind tacky after drying and I did have to run it under a dryer in order for this to go away. Overall a good nail polish.,1
My nails chipped more while using this. Disappointing.,0
"The scent didn't last as long when compared to previous same item bought from  ""Mont Blonc"" store .
It almost thought to be diluted ?",0
Pretty great for resurfacing your skin and getting rid of acne scars. I was able to notice the results within a few days and it was non-irritating to my face.,1
"Excellent file.  Very high quality, doesn't wear down, and files nails quickly.",1
"I should have gathered this from the name, but this is a green with tiny bits of gold but not the color I expected. I don't find it flattering and use it on my niece cause she is easily pleased.",0
Good shaving gel comparing to those found in wholesale club or local pharmacy.,1
I Love this cream,1
"Has a nice mild scent to it, easy to work up an amazing lather with, and enjoy cooling effect with each shave.  This quickly became my daily shaving cream.",1
"1st of all the product is good. It smells good and works well. The problem is, the container is very deceptive. There is a small container inserted inside the one you see that is much smaller. I know it's a selling thing but it's definitely deceptive. Very disappointing.",0
I love this color! It is greige with a slight lavender tint. I didn't use a top coat and still didn't get any chips for about a week.,1
"The best of the dry shampoos I have tried! And I feel like Ive tried them all! Doesnt make my scalp itchy or too dry. Gives my hair new life 2 days after shampooing, only without the water and extra style time. This is my new go to! Now I just need a bigger bottle of it",1
"Awful! Received an old bottle of super goopy polish that leaked up inside the cap. It looked as if the cap was resealed, not even sure this is the real color or fake....really disappointing for $19!",0
"Picture a jar, I received a bottle of liquid.  I also purchased the Facial Cleanser at the same time.  I'm not sure if it's the serum or the cleanser but now my face is waaaaaaayyyy tooooooo dry.  I have stopped using it.",0
Bought for my husband - he liked it.,1
"Let me first say, I have only been using this for a little over 1 week as of this review, but so far, I'm loving this little device. I previously was using a konjac sponge (TheFaceShop brand), which I love, but having to replace it each month was adding up, so I figured I'd try investing in this guy.

I also have used the Clarisonic Mia, but that was extremely harsh on my skin (read: broke me out, badly), even with the sensitive brush + it was pricey to replace the heads so often. So, before finding konjac sponges, the Foreo had been on my list of wants for a long time. I was drawn to the fact that you didn't have to purchase replacements heads it was gentler on the skin. Plus, I figured it would look great out on my counter, as opposed to the aforementioned.

So, when I discovered that I could purchase the Mini 2 at a discount, I jumped at it. So, yes, this product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. BUT it still wasn't cheap. And if I decided that I didn't like it, it would be going back. But so far, I have no desire to send this guy back. The size is just right, it's called a mini, but it doesn't seem mini to me. I liked it so much just in this first week, I ordered the toothbrush as well (which I also love, review on that coming soon).

Pros:
~ Looks great, the black one looks sleek and fits right in with my minimalist aesthetic
~ Easy to clean, I give mine a good wash with my face soap before sitting out to display
~ One charge last for 300 uses (I obviously haven't tested this yet, but will update if it proves to not be true), so you don't have to worry about charging or running out of juice while on vacations... altho, the charger is so small, taking it along doesn't seem like a big deal
~ MAKES MY SKIN FEEL GREAT! My skin feels soft and clean, way better than the Clarisonic, and little better than konjac sponge
~ Environmentally friendly - this guy should last years and years, and you don't have to keep purchasing new heads that will keep filling up our landfills

Cons:
~ None yet. I will update this review as needed as I continue to use this device.",1
"I read so many great things about this product, so, I decided to splurge and try it. I researched the best heat protectant on the market and several sites had Oribe in their top 10, which is disturbing after trying it.

I'm highly disappointed with the outcome. Although it smells great, it acts almost like a hairspray I had in 6th grade when I first attempted to ""style"" my hair. It's horribly sticky and turns your hair as hard as a helmet. For some unruly hair, I'm sure this will work just fine as a hairspray--though I think you can find the same result with a much less expensive product.

For me, I was mainly looking for a heat protectant not a hair tangler...I'm actually not even convinced this is a heat protectant considering when I use a heating product after applying, my hair smokes (even though I've waited for the product to completely dry in my hair). I will not be re-purchasing.",0
I hate to write a negative review but i have to be honest. I used this flat iron 5 times and within a month it stopped working completely! Very disappointed,0
"I'm waiting for a replacement product of this to see if I had a bad batch or these really do nothing but stick to and stretch your under eye skin.  I'm very confused, I've used masks like this before.  There is a fairly sticky back to them with no sign of moisture, serum or anything.  I looked at the ""before"" of my eyes in a 10X magnification mirror then applied them, waited 10 minutes and removed them.  I'm honestly saying my eyes looked worse afterwards, dry and more wrinkly.  The skin was completely dry, for example, no serum or product left under my eye after removal.  It feels as if it is just a very sticky pad with no treatment product on it that only serves to stretch your under eye skin when you take it off.  Not sure who to ask or how to find out if this is how they are supposed to feel.  I received them yesterday and there is a 170816 stamp on the box and the packages inside.  To me, this looks like an expiration date of 8/16/17 but I've read other questions that say it is not.  Extremely disappointed.  If I had paid more for them I would bother with a refund.",0
I'm not impressed with the shellac nails. I ordered this just to try it out. It does not last nearly as long as the gel nails. I would not purchase it again,0
it like any towel,0
"Super disappointed. The product is great, but I ordered a 3-pack and only received one bottle.",0
"Unacceptable. Incredibly poor customer service and dismal support for their products. Do not buy this product or give this company your business. We spent $500 on their product that supposedly comes with a 1 year warranty. The device fell over once since it is top heavy and the screen cracked. It didn't fall from 20 feet, just tipped over. It was totally our fault, oops' happen. We contacted customer support and we received this reply ""Unfortunately our warranty does not cover drops and falls and we do not offer repairs."" I even offered to pay to have the part replaced, no dice. I'm sorry, we do not offer any kind of repairs for the devices. In an age where I can hire a tech to literally come to my door and replace the screen for my mobile phone, which is far more complicated than the basic screen on this product, to have no ability to pay to have the product serviced...that costs $500.00 is absurd and unacceptable. 1 Star. Never again.",0
I was bummed out when I learned that Davines discontinued the For Wizard line. I've been using the No. 2 Gesso for the past three years and was pretty happy with its hold. I found an article saying this pliable paste is the closes thing in this new line to my old product. I can not agree anymore. I've only used this new product for the first day but I can say that the hold is very similar. I actually enjoy the smell of this new product a little better.,1
"Lathers great, feels great, smells great. :)",1
"On mornings where I just don't have time to wash and blow-out my hair, this has been great.  It does produce a fair amount of powder so you need to brush thoroughly to remove all the evidence but it definitely gets rid of the oil that has built up.",1
The consistency is not the same from the one Im buying fr guinot spa..,0
"I like this product. It makes my skin clean and fresh, but not too dry. And I love the smell of this product, very natural. Love it!",1
"Helps keep my acne under control.  I've had several professional glycolic peels so I'm used to the ""tingling""  but for someone who isn't used to glycolic acid, you may want to start with a milder one.  Only been using for about a month, I'm hoping to see more progress with my scarring the more I use it",1
"Can never get it to spread evenly, could be the applicator",0
"My hair is catastrophically thin due to treatments of two cancers. Toppik does a terrific job at hiding the ""holes"" where my hair used to be. I no longer feel insecure about it. It is a terrific product.",1
Box was mangled when I received product and it's a very small tube for the price.,1
Makes my hair smooth and shiny without added weight.,1
Thought I'd try out the other products since I love the thigh cream.... but don't bother.  The thigh cream is amazing but the stomach and arm cream aren't worth the expense.,0
This is perfect for thinning hair. It really covers naturally and comes in many different colors.,1
"too expensive and nothing changed. i will never buy this again. thanks to fake reviews i spent all my money and nothing changed. i have the shampoo , and dietary suplement , i used all of them together , it did not change anything. i started using nioxin products now,i think when something is expensive we believe that it is gonna work. but no it doesnt work.",0
"I love this stuff. It really helped my daughter's cradle cap (she is 5 months and has had it since she was 6 weeks), it's super easy to use and it smells amazing. I only give it four stars because I found that it left her skin a little too dry. However, I started rubbing just a dab of coconut oil on her scalp after each bath and her skin is perfect now! It's the best combination. It's never too greasy and absorbs immediately, leaving her scalp moisturized and flake-free. I tried almond oil, olive oil and aquaphor - all were too greasy and made the cradle cap worse. The coconut oil also calms down the fragrance of the shampoo, which can be a little overpowering for some. I can't stop smelling her head now and I'm so glad it finally looks and feels as soft and beautiful as it did when she was born. Cradle cap is just so disheartening.",1
Works well,1
"I purchased this set and I typically love this line. However, the product was damaged and didn't react as it is supposed to.  Im not sure if it was due to how it was shipped in cold weather or if the product was bad, but either way, it didn't foam as it should when you mix the two parts to the facial mask. The eye gels didn't work as they have in the past either. I strongly suggest being conscious of the outside temperatures when ordering anything beauty related due to chemical composition.  Dont make the same mistake I did.",0
"I got this as a sample in a beauty subscription, and was lucky enough to have gotten 2 samples. I have really sensitive and complicated skin, it's combination but on the oily side. Most skin products I've tried either dry out my skin, making it more oily, or are just too moisturizing leaving my skin greasy and breaking out. I honestly didn't have much hope for this item, and was a little shocked at the price, let me tell you it's a game changer!

I have never had a full sized (yet) so I can't provide any information regarding the quality of bottle, but the cream is white and just the perfect consistency. Not to heavy, spreads very easily, you really don't need very much product at all when used as a serum. Personally I use about the size of a pea for my whole face and feel like I get good coverage from it. I know some people are turned off from the scent, I feel like you either love it or hate it, It's very earthy. To me, it smells exactly like you'd expect if you read the ingredients list, it smells like what it's made of, which to me is very refreshing and speaks to a really high quality. It feels very nice going on the skin, sinks in very quickly not leaving any stickiness or residue behind.

For me, this is a holy grail item. I have a lot of bumps or texture acne on my forehead, some redness and acne scaring, I am as pale as you get, and large pores. After about a week of using this stuff my skin looks AMAZING, honestly it's noticeable within a day or two, but for me it took about a week for my husband to look at me and be like ""wow your skin looks really nice"". It gets rid of all and any break outs or rough skin textures, it brightens, it makes you look rejuvenated and glowing. I know there is some sticker shock at first, but it really is worth every penny. And if your using it as a serum vs as a mask, it should last you a very long time. I don't use it every night, about 3 times a week, and just the tiny samples have lasted soooo long. I'm finally almost out, and already trying to work out getting the money for a full size!

Buy into the hype!! This stuff is incredible. If your unsure, you should be able to get a sample from a department store or something like that. I understand 100 bucks is a lot to drop on something your unsure of but give it a try, you won't regret it.",1
"Has SPF  30  which is what my doctor told me to use. It's a moisturizer, but never greasy",1
"The L'Occitane Ultra Rich shampoo is very good. It's very rich, moisturizing, and creamy. I have naturally wavy hair that is prone to dryness, frizzy, and often feels coarse after shampooing. I have been looking for shampoo that does not have drying sulfates and found this to be a great option. Unlike organic shampoos, this one does not have a funny medicinal smell (it's actually very pleasantly fragranced). The only drawback about this shampoo is the bottle size and difficult-to-open cap. The cap is very small and can be difficult to grab when your hands are wet and slippery. If L'Occitane made the product in a larger size with an easy-to-open cap, I would give it five stars. For the price, this shampoo delivers but it still is a bit pricey considering you are washing it down the drain in less than a minute.",1
we knew there would be no good answer for old stretch marks. used this religiously for about a month and a week and saw no improvement at all. so i gave up. it was worth a shot though. i am glad other have had success.,0
I have noticed that my hair is definitely thicker after using for a few months! I am very satisfied!,1
Ordered 3 tubes/containers of the same color and low and behold when my wife went for the 3rd one it's not the same color. Make sure you check your order when it arrives because now it's to late to returned and my wife is bummed.,0
Smells nice.,1
Have known of this product for years but just purchased. It may make me switch brands.,1
Biggest waste of money. Dont waste your time or money. Zero stars if that was an option.,0
"Meh...didnt do anything for me. Not terrible, but after a month of use my skin did not look better or improved. Tiny jar. Wont be buying this again.",0
great,1
Terrible product! Very greasy makes my hair look worse would never reorder!,0
I was in 8 different hotels in Ireland and Scotland and it did not fit one hair dryer provided,0
"I've used lots of glycolic pads, even stronger than these,  and yet these are the only ones that burn my skin.  I could tolerate it if they worked.",0
Too dry! Not a good product!,0
Great product!  Always keeps my nails in top shape!,1
"I found this to be a very HEAVY fragrance and I didn't smell anything that resembled cotton. The packaging is nice, and it looks like a great gift as long as you don't mind a very heavy, strong scent. The smell wasn't exactly unpleasant but it wasn't what I would imagine at all from reading the description and being highly sensitive I found it overwhelming. If you are expecting a ""soft sensual"" fragrance I believe this is mislabeled!! Beware!",0
"For those who are considering buying this item, make sure you notice the size of this Sunscreen stick. It is really small, but it fits pretty well in purse to carry around. I am giving a 4 start because the cream is a lot thicker than I expected, and sometime is a little hard to apply evenly on to the skin.",1
"************** I am downgrading this hairspray to two stars from five. Why? Because after a week and less than 1/4 of the can used, the entire spray nozzle has failed. It's not clogged or blocked. It has simply stopped working. This happened as I was in the middle of preparing for a formal wedding at 5pm on a Saturday night at a country resort in the middle of nowhere. I couldn't run out and buy a new can of hair spray and I had to borrow some from the bride!!! Never again.

***************** Original Review below **************************************************
I use hair spray every single day and I have been trying to find a single good brand that does the job off my current two brands. I have settled on Suave for the days when I am outside with the horses in the wind, dust and humidity simply because it is inexpensive and my hair stays put. But the trade off is I can't run a brush through my hair after spraying it and it can get dry in the summer. My second option has been Fekkai brand which is excellent, smells pretty, and holds well, yet feels soft & I can brush my hair and it still looks great. But....Fekkai is outrageously overpriced and hard to justify & the nozzles don't always work.

This CHI Keratin has a mild and not unpleasant scent, sprays out in a wide, fine mist and doesn't feel sticky. My hair feels soft and looks nice - the same way it does with the Fekkai and I can brush it for touch ups. If I use a bit more than when I use the Suave, I get a similar strong hold in a wind outside and humidity. On a normal day or if I am going to be inside only, a light spritz of the CHI is all I need. So I think I may have finally found my combination hair spray that does what both the others did all in one.",0
The lipstick tends to bleed near the lip margins... And looks messy,0
This polish definitely lasts longer than traditional polish but not as long as advertised. The color is great though! Definitely use the top coat as well to seal the color in. Mine tended to look dull quickly if I skimped on the top coat.,1
Love it,1
"The slick water definitely makes shaving easier. It's pricey, but you only need a small amount each time. I  am still getting used to shaving with it and I hope it proves to be well worth the price. Shaving daily should make this bottle last four to five weeks tops.",1
Grossly overpriced for the size....3x more expensive than it should be.,0
Love the product..bought it for my bf and he loves it!,1
"Smell was great, my hair was left lump and lifeless",0
Most effective acne product I have ever used!,1
Like  the  champagne  color  the  best  very  good  high lighter,1
"Doesn't stay longer than 4-5 days ,bad quality.",0
"If I could give this zero stars I would. I stopped taking my prenatal vitamins and noticed a change in my nails. I resumed the prenatals and my nails are improving, but before resuming I tried a round of this stuff. Wow. I truly think they put something in there (like they add sodium to soda) to make you continuously need it. I tried it for a full round (1 week) and it made my nails WORSE. I will say that I have never gotten may nails done. I usually only wear a clear coat of polish for a little shine. I had never needed anything else as my nails just naturally grew nicely anyway and just the bit of shine was all that was needed. I am still seeing the effects of this in a few nails. About half have recovered. If you have trouble with splitting nails I highly recommend just taking prenatal vitamins. I had been taking them for 12 years and prior to that I recall my nails never being strong enough to grow long.",0
My makeup comes off easily. I just put several drops in my hand and spread it around my face then use a fresh wet warm washcloth to wipe it off. Seems to dissolve makeup and cleans well leaving my face feel refreshed. Never thought it would work as it does not suds or resemble soap in any way.,1
Just a typical concealer. Nothing special.,0
My nail polish came cracked I keep trying to send a message and I get no response $10 isn't cheap for a nail polish so it's upsetting when you get a cracked bottle,0
"Feels like your putting glue in your hair. Does not work. I'm very disappointed in this product, both the shampoo and the conditioner.",0
"1. I love the smell, reminds me of marshmallows!

2. Really does improve your nail condition. I use this 2-3 times a day, rub it and apply lotion, my cuticles feel super nourished!

3. WAAAAAY better then the CND Solar Oil Nail and Cuticle Conditioner",1
"This product was recommended by a co-worker. The very 1st week i use it I saw a big changes on my skin.. I had a lot of pimples and bumps on my forehead and they were all gone for just a 2nd week of using it.. Try it.. It will cost u a lot buy hey, Its the result that matters..",1
Decent aftershave at a good price point.,1
Loved it.,1
Crazy how well it works and the difference it makes!,1
"I wake up in the morning with frizzy hair on one side of my head - the side that I slept on, I've tried the satin pillow that others have suggested but my head keeps sliding off the pillow. I decided to try this after reading the reviews.
Pros - It does what it's supposed to do - refreshes my curls and they look great.

Cons - It is a little sticky coming out of the bottle but that goes away
  It says to use a little - no, you have to use a lot to get rid of the frizzies
  VERY expensive for only 8 oz.

I gave it four stars because it does what it says it will do which is pretty unusual in the hair care market. I will keep using it because my hair does look great but if I could find something else that works just as well for less money, I'd switch.",1
Worked well with problem blemishes.,1
I get a lot of compliments on it hours after I put it on and think  no one can smell it. It has a clean expensive smell. I love this perfume.,1
Works as expected.  Good price/Value,1
"It's almost looks dirty on your face. Did not expect it to be as dark as it was. And it's extremely pigmented so you can easily look like you have dirt on your face. Cannot wear it, unfortunately.",0
"I have REALLY bad under eye circles, I use this in a part of my ""Under Eye Circle Cover Up Routine."" My mom bought it for her but the ""Light"" was too dark for her.
I use Nyx concealer in Yellow, LA minerals concealer in Cinderella Yella, and Time balm in Light for my under eye circles.",1
"Love this product, nice color",1
This cleanser has cleared my acne. I get breakouts here and ther but nothing like I used to. The only reason I did not rate 5 stars is because it dries my face. I use a facial oil the moisturize in the morning And at night I used a moisturizing night mask. It dries my face really bad. I have been using this cleanser for about 3 months and I love it now that I figured out a cleansing and moisturizing routine that works for my skin type. Highly recommend this cleanser!!,1
"Smooth, buttery, super pigmented. Just as great as the Pro 1 & 2 Palettes.",1
Too dark,0
"Mine smelt when I opened it and it was thick and not even a damp Beauty Blender sponge would get this on my eyes smoothly. The color was really dark and I'm blue eyes blonde, plus it irritated my eyes. Awful product, I ordered it because I have a great love for Julep Lip Crayons, but this primer was way below my standards, and the color is hideous. I would have preferred no color and no smell.",0
Used once then it went in the garbage.  I was highly allergic to this product and broke out all along my forehead.  Beware of this product as I am not particularly sensitive to most products but this one was a disaster.,0
Bottle covered with large sticky label,0
Was not completely satisfied with this product. It wasn't like the sample I received in my monthly birchbox (which I loved). It doesn't spray out correctly and it leaves a sticky white residue each time. Even after shaking it and spraying it in short burts like it says on the bottle. It came perfectly packaged. I'm guessing the one I received was from a faulty batch :(,0
This is absolutely not 6 speed. This is 3 speed and 3 different temperature settings. Absolutely false advertisement!!!,0
"The 2nd ingredient is propylene glycol! They should have the list of ingredients in the product description so that people know what's in it before they purchase, instead of posting the ingredient label as a photo that might not get looked at. I will be sending this back for a refund. I refuse to spritz my face with propylene glycol.

For those of you who don't know, propylene glycol is a chemical created as a byproduct of petroleum refining (meaning it comes from the same stuff that oil and gasoline are made of). According to the Material Safety Data Sheet on propylene glycol, the chemical is a strong skin irritant, and has been implicated in contact dermatitis. The sheet goes on to warn that the ingredient can inhibit skin cell growth and damage cell membranes, causing rashes, dry skin, and surface damage. No thanks!",0
"I have wanted one of these for years but balked at the cost.  However, the FIRST time I pulled this brush through my hair, I felt a difference.  It actually seemed to make an immediate difference in the texture of my hair (smoother) and it that was also the first day I noticed a decrease in my hair fall out!  I only gave it a 4 because I do wonder if another, less expensive brush with boar bristles would work the same.  However, I have to say that for years I've been using a combination boar bristle/nylon brush from Bass and the Mason Pearson is HEADS AND TAILS above that one!  Perhaps that's because the Bass had little balls on the end of the nylon bristles which (I never knew until recently) were pulling and breaking my hair and this one does not.  I've also recently purchased 2 Spornette brushes: one with a combination of nylon and boar bristles and one with just nylon bristles.  And I have to say that the Spornette brushes really hurt my scalp while the Mason Pearson feels absolutely heavenly!

Update to original review:
I'm still very happy with my purchase of the Mason Pearson brush.  However, I wanted to add that I have since purchased two Morrocco Method (MM) boar bristle/nylon brushes and wanted to compare them for you.

The extra large MM brush (they only have two sizes available - extra large and small) is about 1/2"" wider than the Mason Pearson Junior so it looks/feels more like a paddle brush.  As soon as I opened the box I smelled a chemical smell; a smell distinctly absent from the Mason Pearson brush.  The MM brush comes with no care instructions or any accessories.  The Mason Pearson came with detailed care instructions and a smaller brush to clean the hairbrush.  The MM brush feels much the same on the scalp as the Mason Pearson (divine).  The MM brush lost a bristle the first time I used it and has lost a couple of bristles since.  The Mason Pearson has yet to lose a bristle in the past 3 months I've owned it.

I would say that for those who are on a tight budget but want/need to care for their hair better, the MM brush is a good alternative at $39.  I'm happy I have both and won't mind replacing the MM brush if I need to.

By the way, I also purchased the MM small brush and that is probably less than half the size of the MP Junior.  It also had the chemical smell.  It is the perfect size for my purse (or for a child).",1
"I love blink mascara, however with my last purchase the bottles came dryer than normal, almost felt empty. SO SAD. I'm a huge fan and have never had any problems before with their products! :( :( :(",0
Love this product!,1
Really like color but does have some glitter in it and I did not know it did... But looks pretty good!,1
"This Product has a short life.  Purchase last April, already will not power up.  Purchased Original from QVC, after 18 months it will not turn on or power up. Purchased  from Amazon, same problem after 12 months.  Never used daily.",0
"Bought this as a Christmas gift for the wife based on a recommendation from a friend who is a stylist.  She loves it and it has worked flawlessly for the past 3 months.  She said the plates are nice and smooth and it doesn't 'catch' her hair like some flat irons do.  Also, she says it is very easy to use for curling her hair also.  A great styling tool at this price point.",1
"I recently decided to give CNI a shot after being mostly an OPI user.  I have to say that you can really tell when you put it on.  My color polish looks shiny but then I put on a coat of CNI and think ""wow.""  I am always changing my polish so I can't really speak to the durability.  It seems to look good for the four or five days I go between polish changes.  I also have been wearing it mostly with OPI colors (I was sorta stuck on them for a while :-) but it seems to mix well.  I also like the consistency.  Its thin and doesn't dry super quick so I can go slowly and get it just right.  I just use a spray to speed up the drying if necessary.",1
The worst shaving cream!!!!!,0
Best skin cleanser I've ever used! Its odd because it doesn't feel like its doing much - as it doesn't foam or fuzz like other cleansers. But my skin hasn't looked this good in years! Not that I'm that old (28) but I've been blemish free and my pores even look smaller.,1
My brother loves this stuff and its definitely a good price for the amount you get as compared to what comes in the hair salon. It does make hair look a bit greasy though with the sheen.,1
lasted about 2 weeks before it fell apart,0
"My previous plastic eyelash curler before this one lasted me many years of daily curling, but this one only worked from April 20th - August 30th. The problem is the little lever that holds the curler down has this skinny little attachment that started to crack and finally broke.

While the dual curl pad worked for me and gave me subtle, curled lashes in one press, it's a terrible value if it's only going to last four months! I mean, c'mon! I'm ordering the normal Go Curl one to replace this and just hoping the attachments are longer lasting.",0
Great product.,1
"I've used this product twice before and it works much better than Latisse for me.  I first used this product through Nordstrom's then through Drugstore.com at an incredible price, couldn't find it this time there so I went to Amazon.  The price has gone up, the name keeps changing but the product is great.  I find it by the tube color.",1
great,1
"I discovered this 2-in-one wash (hair & body) for babies when my son was a few months old, and when I couldn't find it I tried others.  There is no comparison; Mustella is a little more expensive but worth every cent.  My son is now 3 1/2 and I still use this for him.  It makes him smell so clean and sweet but not perfumy.  Very natural, and never bothers his eyes. The lotion is terrific too, but when he got older I started using Aveeno to save a little money and it works great.  I still get the baby smell from the wash.  Don't waste your $ on other washes.",1
I use to love this product that I bought in ULTA before. This time I ordered it in Amazon since I was away from ULTA store. Big mistake..the brush was not the same quality that the one from ULTA. I  not sure if the distributor send different qualities to different places but it make a huge difference applying the product with a good and thick brush than with a crappy and flat brush..you have to apply it at least three times instead of just once. LOOK AT THE PICTURE...THE ONE IN THE RIGHT IS MY OLD BRUSH 3 TIMES THICKER THAN THE ONE IN THE LEFT( THE ONE I ORDERED IM AMAZON) would be so sad the company downgrade the quality of the brush in order to save on the cost of the productos.,0
The metal pin that connects the brush head completely broke off. The company says there's a 2-Year warranty but I have to pay to send the toothbrush back. Not impressed.,0
This is my all-time favorite fragrance by Crabtree & Evelyn.  I got a set before my wedding and I've used it ever since.  Now when I wear it it reminds me of my honeymoon to New Hampshire.,1
Been using it for about a month. Really like it. Lightweight. It hasn't caused any breakouts and it's a great value for the amount you get! Would recommend!,1
"It performs as stated. Great stuff.
BTW the new packaging is terrible! Please go back to the tubes.",1
Product arrived on time however once I opened it it had leaked all over the box. The source? the pump off the top of the bottle had broken off which was a very good feature of this product,0
"I could not get this stuff to dry. Perhaps I'm just not patient enough but if after 20 min a polish isn't dry, I'm done with it. Really pretty color, but I don't have that kind of time.",0
Really cheap,0
love this product! just one pump will smooth out your hair without making it look greasy and dirty! the smell is light and nice too! paul mitchell has done a fine job once again! the pump design of the bottle is a plus!,1
"This item is a knockoff. When I looked at the handle, the silver coating was chipping and the original black color of the handle was coming through. When I put on the color, it was thick, bubbling, and clumping on my nail. It did not apply like the rest of my OPI products.",0
I ordered two and the outside package was different on one. I suppose I received a counterfeit. The tubes inside are the same. I didn't order from two separate retailers and I paid the same high price for both. I've been getting the product at Walgreens. I was trying to figure out if there was a package change. I'm dropping my Prime.,0
"This body cream has a pleasant, earthy scent - it might be ideal for someone who enjoys the fragrance of essential oils. It's not overly floral or feminine in fragrance and would be a nice option for both men and women. The cream absorbs in nicely without leaving a greasy residue. The smell reminds me a little bit of the spa. The packaging is attractive as well.",1
The product just wasn't what I thought it would be and didn't work well for me personally.,0
was too sheer for me.,0
"My favorite curling iron ever. Curls hot, fast, and lasting curls. I won't ever buy another brand.",1
Ordered Wednesday morning you said it would be here Friday by 8 p.m. just like last year you've always changed your tune.... going to keep closer tabs on my records this year last year you screwed up many orders,0
"My hair gets horribly dry in the wintertime, and if I don't do anything extra to add moisture, I end up with a staticky mess every morning. This is my go-to masque. I realize it says it's for medium-coarse hair, but it works wonders on my fine, straight hair. The smell is nice, but doesn't linger too long or strongly, which is nice when you don't want it mingling with your perfume. Highly recommended.",1
This product burns my eyes and it stopped working after a week. I don't recommend it.,0
I didn't find this dryer any better than my old drugstore dryer. It does have the removable filter which I like but that is the only benefit. The buttons are not easy to use when your hands are clean but almost impossible to use when you have styling product on your hands. The cool shot bottom is in an awkward place as well. I find I hit it unintentionally. It didn't blow dry my hair faster than my old dryers.,0
"I bought a few of the Vinylux nail polishes and top coat after a friend of mine raved about them on Facebook.  Let me tell you, not a fan.  I don't know if the polishes I got were old, or what, but they go on kind of thick and goopy, no matter how thin you try to get it, and I am used to doing thin, I also do gel nails on myself.  And then when you put the topcoat on, it looks even goopier and bubbly.  And to top all that off, it only lasts a day on me before chipping.  So sorry I wasted all that money!",0
Smells good but,0
I have super short curly hair...this is the only thing that lays my hair down!,1
I have been using this eye cream for the past few years. I love the feel and the fact that the cream absorbs well. I have sensitive eyes and this product has not caused any problems for me. I will continue to purchase in the future.,1
"I was a little concerned when I ordered this for my wife for her birthday. Some of the reviews said it was a knockoff. I went ahead and bought it anyway. Well, it is real and not a knockoff. It arrived safely. I do wish it had shipped quicker but that is a minor complaint. My wife is happy so that means that I am happy too. :)",1
Timely delivery and a great product.,1
What a great gift for my girlfriend. She loves the product.,1
Great scent. Terrific results. Absolutely 5 stars.,1
"AMAZON MADE AN ERROR IN THE DESCRIPTION!!!  This is a wash/cleanser, which is not mentioned at all.  The title only describes this product as ""Jan Marini Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5%-8 oz"".  I was searching for a benzoyl peroxide leave-on treatment.  I shopped on my phone, and could not see the tiny writing on the bottle in the small photo of the product.  My review is against the description, not against the product, which i have not used.",0
"With virtually all of the anti-aging products I've tried, I can say for sure there has been no lasting effect (beyond the instant improvement any dry skin gets from any hydration). In contrast, I'm pretty sure this has had a very mild but enduring effect on my crow's feet.

I used the entire bottle, which lasted about 5 weeks, one pump twice daily. I applied first to my eyes, then spread the remainder to the rest of my face. As directed, after it dried, I followed with my usual moisturizer (in this case, a Revitalift product that I'd used independently and knew was having no real anti-aging benefits, but is an effective moisturizer). After about 3 weeks, I started to think I might be seeing an effect, and by the end of the bottle, I hadn't talked myself out of it. I know that's not a ringing endorsement, but compared to my typical impressions of so-called anti-aging products, it's significant.

It's easy to apply (tiny pump bottle--I always feel like I'm being cheated out of a couple applications with a pump, though it protects the product from contamination), absorbs and dries quickly. I would apply it, brush my teeth, and it would always be completely dry and ready for moisturizer.

I have one mirror with natural light that is particularly unflattering and always makes me feel like a crone when I catch my reflection. After the full bottle, I look marginally less ancient. Considering that's just 5-6 weeks, not too shabby. But considering it's $59 and a tiny bottle, and would cost me north of $500 a year to use continuously, unfortunately too much for me to extend my experiment.

My info: 47 with pretty good skin and average crow's feet and expression lines. Not prone to breakouts. Very dry skin in winter, dry enough to need moisturizer twice daily year round. My skincare routine is washing with plain water + moisturizer AM & PM, sunscreen if I will be outside at all, including longer drives. Sometimes I add a targeted serum or eye cream to the mix, but I rely on keeping my routine very basic (or I won't keep it up).",1
so good perfume.,1
"I don't smell much other than tobacco and vanilla with this, but it's wonderful nevertheless. I generally don't care too much about matching fragrances to the season/weather, but this one is definitely an exception,  as it's really suited only for cold weather. Wearing this during summer would just be silly and weird.

I kind of feel like I may be a bit too young for this at 25, but I wear it anyway and it's not like anyone has mocked me for it (on the contrary, I'm only ever told I smell nice). 3 to 5 sprays last me most of the day and it projects nicely. I'd gladly repurchase this when my current bottle runs out, but I'll probably wait until I'm 35+, assuming it's still in production then.",1
Don't buy!,0
good stuff.  Nice strong minty taste.  I like it because it has a screw cap which is safer to travel with so it doesn't accidentally pop open in your toiletries bag,1
horrible broke the day i got it,0
This was a gift and the recipient tells me that it is very nice lotion with a lovely citrusy aroma.,1
"Absolutely not auburn! More of a dark blonde color. I could have purchased a similar item in a department or drug store for a lot less. As a ginger, it is frustrating that someone would think that this is a shade of red.",0
"The Elta sunscreen products were recommended by my dermatologist.  I chose this tinted one because I was hoping for a tiny bit of coverage to help even out my skin tone.  Instead it went on practically clear and very shiny. I also wanted some sunscreen protection for the delicate eye area.  I could not use this anywhere near my eyes because it burned like crazy and I had to wash it off after about 10 minutes.  I tired it a second time and the same thing happened. Also I was disappointed when I read in the instructions that for it to be effective for sunscreen protection you need to reapply it every two hours.  It was not that expensive, but it was a waste of money for me.",0
"i've been trying to transition to this razor for several months now and still can't use it with out cutting my face. the newer 4 blade disposable systems do work better. I know using this style of shaver is fun and sleek looking, that's why I switched. I'm ready to switch back to the newer and more advanced type, eg.... gillette fusion. isn't technology great?
I've tried different brand razors too including the Feather.",0
"This is one of my favorite shower gels during the warmer months. It isn't sickly sweet or heavy, just a nice crisp citrus that is refreshing and light. Perfect for men as well as women.
Unlike round bottles, it doesn't take up a lot of precious bathroom real estate, and if you place your showering necessities on a windowsill, it fits nicely.
For the ultimate 'fresh', pair with the L'Occitane Verbena Body Milk.",1
"I really do see a positive difference since I started using Supersmile :)
I would purchase it again.",1
"Ordered for my daughter, she loves it.
Not my favorite scent from the clean collection.",1
Blends nicely. I would prefer a slightly lighter shade but it seems to work. It will be fine for summer.,1
"Huge fan of the entire line. I've been using the line for 4 months now! Won't wear or use any other toner, serum, or creams on my faucet daily. Totally worth every penny.",1
Love it and would recommend to others.,1
"Its supposed to give your hair volume??  I've tried it a couple of times, it just makes my hair flatter.  It does add shine and smoothness, I will give you that.  But volume?  None at all, in fact it takes the amount you did have away.",0
"I've used two of the four masks that came in the box (I was wondering how many there would be when I ordered it since it wasn't specified anywhere at that time). In order to use a mask, you must peel off one side of backing, press it against your face in the right place, and then peel off the clear backing. The mask does not adhere strongly enough to your face to make this possible. You really have to pull it away and work it a little to get it to come free, and then peel carefully while holding it against your face lest the whole thing come back off. The bottom half worked the same way but went on a little more easily. In terms of ease of use, a traditional mud rub wins, though it does come back off pretty easily. I actually asked for help during the first application, and we wondered if the issues were temperature related. It's in the 80s here this past week, and temperature could factor into how well this product peels off the backing and how well it sticks to your face.

On the down side, it doesn't do much. Because it doesn't seem to press into the pores as well, it doesn't pull the dirt out as well as traditional masks. It was better than nothing. I did feel it have some small impact. It just wasn't as effective as other products I have used. On the up side, if you have sensitive skin as I do, it didn't result in any redness. Some of my regular mask products do leave my face a bit red after an application.

Overall, this mask didn't seem to do enough to be worth the hassles of using it, let alone any price you would pay for it. Admittedly, it's a new product (my packages were labeled ""Lot 001"") that the manufacturer could improve over time. I hope they do, because it isn't a bad idea. Maybe a little thicker ""mud"" layer would make the difference?",0
I like how it looks on my face but not how it smells.,0

"My daughter believes that she can not function without this product after she showers. She is taking Cosmo in our local Votech School and like most hair stylist, she loves to dye her hair. Keeping up with her profession has been very bad for her hair. She washes it a lot less these days, but will make sure that there is always some of this left on the sink. I love the smell and she loves the feel.",1
Works well and love the long handle. Still going through my sample blade package to find the blade I really like.,1
"Didn't irritate my eyes, which was my primary concern, but also didn't last more than an hour or two.",0
I bought for my daughter and her skin has really improved from daily use.,1
"My salon gave me this hairdryer when my hair fell out due to a bad Brazilian blowout. It last less than a year, it would only blow cold air.  I liked it when it did work so I bought another one on Amazon. This one is 9months old and it so hot, the nozzle has turned brown.
Its breaking my hair. I won't buy it again.",0
"I honestly don't notice a difference, even after several uses.",0
good,1
Greasy stinging feeling after using for 3 weeks not a good product,0
I have been searching for a great eyelash curler and bought 3 based on reviews. I have tried it many times even using the hairdryer to heat it. It does NOT even bend my lashes in the slightest. I ordered 2 from tweezerman and they are great.,0
"Nice, expensive for what you get but nice neutral colors and last all day.",1
I use it in the shower before I go to bed. It only takes a small smount to work.,1
Good,1
No noticeable change in volume.  A complete waste of money.,0
"The absolute best eyeliner I've ever used. Long lasting, and doesn't rub off when applying or correcting eyeshadow.",1
"Been using it and almost done with the bottle; yet, i've not seen any major differences so I don't think it's working",0
"CHI IS A GOOD HAIR PRODUCT THAT HELPS TO RECOVER FROM A DRY, THE BACK SHINY, SILKY, NATURAL, also use the CHI INFRA, which are to make lights ....., I love the hair is bleached and not It has destroyed because Ammonia !! ... Excellent !!",1
"This is great. I use it on a daily basis. Great for any problem spot you may have. Just use it in the shower, and you will see results.",1
This worked great for giving more density to the hair. The results were great. I only give it 4 stars because it looks terrible of you use it around the hairline Where your hair is thinning more. It is noticeable near the hairline if you use too much. I would recommend this product for those who want fuller hair but not for people who are trying to recreate a hairline. Doesn't come out during the day when you spray extra hold hairspray before and after application.,1
My husband like it!,1
Product was received on time as was as advertised.  Made a great gift.,1
"I have blond hair that is very thin, and if I do not wash it everyday, it gets GREASY. I use this shampoo as a quick fix if I am headed off to the gym or errands but I don't want to wash my hair beforehand. While it does not substitute against an actual shampoo and blow dry, it definitely makes my hair look better then nothing at all. I would recommend it as long as you aren't expecting this to take the place of real hair washing.",1
New as promised!,1
"It was great at first, however after a few uses it stopped working. I wasn't even able to clean out the spout in case of a blockage.  A waste of money on  my part.",0
